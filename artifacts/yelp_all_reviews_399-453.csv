Taqueria La Guera,1,I usually eat at  2 off Oltorf St. but the food is better than most restaurants and trucks.
Taqueria La Guera,2,Tiny trailer. Tex-Mex food. Cash only. Red sauce is HOT  Tripas were OK and so was the potato and chorizo taco. The number of selections was impressive. If I am in the area again I may drop in. Lots of Tex-Mex food in this area compete with each other.
Taqueria La Guera,3,WoW  My neighbor mentioned this place coming back from HEB and I am so glad he did. My neighbor got the burrito  which looked immense considering the  7. I had been craving a Torta and was happy. What a hidden gem  There seems to be a widely varied menu to choose from. The food was fast and the people friendly. Can t wait to go back.
Taqueria La Guera,4,Wow. We picked a random taco truck on the site of the road  and I m glad we did. 4 tacos for  7  not pictured are the cactus and egg taco and the chorizo and egg taco . Everything was freshly cooked and delicious. And the salsas were
Taqueria La Guera,5,My dad and I both got chorizo  amp  potato and egg  amp  bacon. Very delicious  quick service  great salsa. Will be back 
Las Palapas,1,A much needed good fast casual Tex-Mex restaurant in the Four Points area. My prayers have been answered.   The Puffy Tacos are outstanding. Homemade puffy corn tortillas stuffed with delicious picadillo beef. Cooked to perfection and tasty.   The hot sauce and queso are spot on. You could dine on this alone.   Anxious to come back and try other dishes but so far this hits all the marks for simple  good  fast Tex Mex.   Service was friendly and prompt.
Las Palapas,2,I have had the pleasure of eating at a number of Los Palapas locations in the San Antonio area. I have always been very happy with the food and the service.  This Austin location is a franchise and has had a difficult time getting opened up. Now they are open for drive-thru service most every day of the week and dining service in the afternoons a couple of days a week. While dining there this afternoon we were told that the problem has been with Staffing shortages.  My dining partner and I were both very happy with our choices and enjoyed our experience at Las Palapas near the intersection of 620 and 2222.   Each of us had a cup of chicken tortilla soup which was a very good. I ate a plate of two Puffy Tacos with ground beef in them and my partner had an ala carte shrimp taco and a puffy taco.  We will both be back and will likely try breakfast once they open up for early morning hours. Their menu is extensive and the food is good.
Las Palapas,3,This place has only been open at this location for about a week.  We were here for breakfast.  I had the breakfast chalupa plate.  It comes with two chalupas topped with your choice of eggs  beans  lettuce  tomatoes  avocado  and cheese.  It was very  very good.  The plate comes with homemade corn tortillas or flour tortillas.  We chose the corn.  The tortillas were fresh  steaming hot  and delicious.  I also had the chorizo and egg breakfast taco.  It was delicious too.  My hubby had the bacon and egg plate.  It comes with two eggs  three thick slices of bacon  potatoes and beans  and tortillas.  He said it was very good.    We will certainly come back  
Las Palapas,4,Had their chips and queso. Chicken and shrimp tacos. They were both really good. The size of the shrimp was big. Thought the whole meal was really good and filling. Shrimp well seasoned  the chicken was juicy  I feel like it was chicken thighs. But I could be wrong. Really good  I ll be back again.
Las Palapas,5,Great big tv to watch the game. I had the LP Breakfast and it s was amazing    Bloody Mary was spot on.
Las Palapas,6,Very disappointed  Waited months for this place to open  every time I would stop by it was close early. We finally got to come in for the first time and the place looked pretty good I love the restroom sink finally a normal sink  Service was good from the young lady that delivered our food.. waiter was ok a lil rushy... unfortunately the food was awful  everything was cold.. cheese was not melted in my enchilada and I ve never ate queso I didn t like .. that was soo strange. Unfortunately we will probably not be returning.. I rather eat Taco Cabana.
Las Palapas,7,Excellent  amp  delicious food  homemade tortillas  Margaritas   amp  service     Finally some real Mexican food.
Las Palapas,8,First time here. Started out on a very high note with the wonderful young lady in the drive-thru. She has fantastic customer service skills. Very friendly and great smile. You don t get that anymore. Food was fresh and tasted good. Tortillas were soooooo good  I m anxious to try several different dishes at this place. Especially breakfast.
Las Palapas,9,My husband and I walked in around lunch time. They were not very busy. We were not acknowledged at all  not even a greeting. After my husband approached an employee  someone came and said  that lady will be with you shortly ...we waited a few more minutes and walked out. A simple greeting goes a long way and they didn t even do that. So they lost business today.
Taquizas Mariana,1,Like most people in Austin  I have a deep love for tacos. But unlike most people who live here  I grew up a hop  skip  jump away from the border so I  know  tacos. Last night  we went to a 50th birthday party that ended up revealing to me that I can actually find border style tacos in Austin... and they come to you.  Taquizas Mariana had a setup there. A plancha style affair with a trompo spit  tiny corn tortillas  fresh salsas  pollo  bistek  and helotes. I felt like the proprietor - Mariana - and I were besties at the end of the night but I d also had a lot of tequila. What I do know for sure is that the food was amazing. I had 6 tacos and an entire corn on the cob and the only reason I didn t go back because I was too damn full. But I wanted to. I wanted to grab the spit and run and make pastor tacos for the rest of the week. She said she ll make whatever - mole  lengua  menudo  etc.   I don t want to write this because it likely means that everyone else will discover how great she is but I also want to keep finding her at backyard parties like some kind of delightful surprise.
Taquizas Mariana,2,Mariana Taquizas was AMAZING  The variety of different tacos  salsas  and  Aguas frescas were a hit  The cactus sales was so delicious  Thank you for making our baby shower a success with such tasty food and great customer service   I will definitely recommend y all and use you again.  Thank you    Veronica
Taquizas Mariana,3,They were over one hour late and our guests were hungry.  But The tacos and quesadillas were deliciouso.  My guests kept going back for more .  And the portions where good...... plus they have a reasonable prices .
Taquizas Mariana,4,Went from CA to a party where these people were contracted  they were 2 hrs late  everyone was starving and to top it off when food was  ready  tacos meat was frozen  quesadillas burned but cheese was cold unmelted  and raw. They were supposed to serve 50 people  we were less than the 50 present at the party and barely half were served rice and beans. My table and the one next to ours didn t get rice or beans because food was not enough   My kids who are not picky with food and were starving just tried it and didn t want to eat  at least beans and rice would ve been enough if there had been any. HOW EXPENSIVE CAN BEANS AND RICE BE . Avoid them unless you want your guests to go buy fast food  want mediocre service and food poisoning.
Taquizas Mariana,5,We requested their catering services for my daughter s graduation. They arrived on time and got to work setting up and cooking  we were eating in 30 minutes. The food was fantastic. Just like a traditional Mexican taco stand. We have eaten in many parts of Mexico and this is honestly mexican food  carne de pollo  bistec  y carne de al pastor with all the fixings. Great salsas  different levels of spiciness. And even aguas frescas with little pieces of fruit  Loved them  Saved their number in my phone   Will 100  use them again 
Taquizas Mariana,6,I just can t say enough about Mariana and her husbands delicious cooking    I found her here on yelp. I was a little wary seeing she just had one review but i was mind blown   We hired them for our rehearsal back yard party which I must add was 90  family from Mexico. Which means I needed the best of the best tacos Texas has to offer. My family from out of town were impressed and even went for seconds  I definitely recommend this family owned business for your next party  Call Mariana 
Taquizas Mariana,7,Plain and simple  everything was delicious. She had everything set up well  food tasted good. The aguas were great. Hire her for your next event.  Todo estaba delicioso   
Taquizas Mariana,8,Best tacos in the round rock austin area  Great service and the workers are so friendly  Cant wait for my next party to call these guys  5 stars.
Taquizas Mariana,9,This was THE BEST catering experience ever  The Taco Stand brought over was amazing. Marianas sons came over and set up everything and cooked everything fresh. They had different jugs of juices  pineapple  horchata and lemonade. They had different toppings for the tacos and different salsas  The meats were delicious  they brought over  trompo pork   steak and chicken. I had family visit  from Mexico and they were raving about the taste and authenticity of these tacos. The guys took care of everything the set up  they brought plates and napkins and cups. If you need a taco stand at any party or wedding HIRE THEM  SO GOOD 
Taquizas Mariana,10,I am glad to see others had better experiences than me. The reason for my 1 star  They showed up 1 hour late to our planned event  This was a big deal and a very special event  Mariana s communication was very poor  I thought she would be the one helping at the event and had no idea that she would be sending other people on her behalf  she never mentioned that to me . I found out the day of the event when I called her  after no one showed up  and she told me her team was on the way. To my disappointment  when they did not show up 30 minutes later  I called again but she never answered. I texted her and asked her for a discount for the inconvenience but she never responded to my text either. I voiced my concerns with her team after they finally showed up and they apologized  they were scheduled for 1 hour later than what I had discussed with Mariana by phone and text  but Mariana never bothered to text me back. I am very disappointed in her communication style and her customer service.   To be fair  the food and service of the team that came to host us was good. The guys were very nice and stayed an extra hour to make up for lost time.   Unfortunately  I will not recommend her due to her lack of communication  and to her ignoring not responding to my text. Customer service was very poor.
Taquizas Mariana,11,AWESOME TACOS    I was stressing on finding a good taco truck for my little boy Baptism  amp  happened to find Mariana on here  amp  I just trusted the reviews. We are all 100  Mexican so we are very picky on good authentic tacos and let me tell you the trompo  bistec   amp  barbacoa were AMAZING. Aguas frescas  amp  salsas were on POINT   Super duper recommend service is amazing  amp  very friendly
Chicanas Tacos,1,The wait at Jiffy Lube was long so decided to try this taco stand that opened across the street a couple of months back. I live a few blocks from here so I notice new things come up and a food cart in North Campus   Hyde Park is pretty rare.  The food is really quite cheap   1.50 breakfast tacos   2 lunch tacos  and a few things such as quesadillas a little bit more but all less than  4 .   I ordered a chicken fajita taco   2  and a potato breakfast taco   1.50  with the 50 cent cent tip came out to just  4. Both tacos were on flour and I opted to get lettuce and tomatoes on the chicken taco. The chicken fajita taco and salsa were mediocre pretty mediocre. The chicken didn t taste that fresh although the tortilla and vegetables were fresh. The included salsa  one a green sauce and one a red sauce were also not particularly flavorful although both were spicy  even for someone that indulges in spicy food pretty regularly. However  the breakfast potato taco was excellent. The potatoes and cheese tasted fresh and the tortilla had the same fluffy  chewy quality of the one used in the chicken fajita taco. Luckily for me  these breakfast tacos are served all day.  I definitely recommend stopping by  especially if you live in the area  are looking for cheap eats  or like Mexican food. Also please note unlike some of the food carts  although like most of them   this place is cash only but it should be easy to scrounge up some cash for this place given its price.
Chicanas Tacos,2,Chicanas has set up shop on 38th and Guadalupe  and it is very distinguishable  what with its plain white cart and bright yellow sign. Plus  there is not much in the way of food carts in this neck of the woods. The menu is simple  boasting meat-laden tacos during lunch and breakfast tacos all the day long.  Chicanas was not all that bad  but I just felt like it incited somewhat of a perversion of the homemade appeal of getting a nitty-gritty taco off of a mobile eatery. To explain  I must go deep into the truck.  I looked into the truck and saw Hill Country Fare  for those who know HEB  you will quickly recognize this as the  house  brand  refried beans. First red flag  canned refried beans. The other mark of mediocrity was the microwave. My tortillas were microwaved  when I at least would have preferred some toasting on a skillet. Alas  I can t have it all...  The taco-based grub is pretty good here  but if you are around this part of town thirsting for some quality  though maybe not authentic  fare  you may just want to head over to the haunt in proximity to 42nd and Lamar. This joint is not specifically desirable  though you could eat here if you wanted to avoid paying a pretty penny.
Chicanas Tacos,3,Amazing salsa and breakfast tacos. Takes about 5 minutes. Not long at all. Made to order takes time. Huge portions  3 tacos for 4 bucks is a no brainier.
Chicanas Tacos,4,The food here was great  with one exception  I definitely plan to return. I ordered three tacos  chorizo and egg   1.50   chicken fajita   2   and pastor taco   2 .  You re given a choice of flour or corn tortilla.    The chorizo and egg was great. I was pleasantly surprised that cheese was included.  The egg was fluffy and there was just the right amount of chorizo to add flavor but not make it too greasy.  I order this with a flour tortilla and it had clearly been heated cooked as well.  It tasted fresh made  but I can t be sure. Very delicious.  The chicken and pastor tacos were prepared in authentic Mexican street style  small pieces of meat with only cilantro  onions  and an optional spicy salsa.  The chicken was flavorful and moist.  The pastor seemed a little overcooked and lacking deep flavor  it didn t seem much like the stewed pastor I m used to  so it s possible there was a mistake and I got the wrong taco. Regardless of what it was  there wasn t enough flavor for me to want to order another in the future.  The woman in the trailer was nice and I thought the food overall was great for the price.  I definitely plan to come back to try more.  If I remember right  they also serve gorditas and tortas  so I ll have to try them as well.
Chicanas Tacos,5,I m glad I ignored the mediocre reviews. Their breakfast tacos are great- they are pretty big  very fresh and  best of all  they have my favorite kind of verde sauce  the sort of creamy and spicy kind. Best of all they are inexpensive and fast. Definitely go here  
Chicanas Tacos,6,Chicken fajita taco was quite good and the salsas were great. My lunch partner got chorizo and pastor and enjoyed them. Got a breakfast taco and both the potato and the bacon were on the raw side and disappointing. This place does not sell drinks whatsoever and the gas station next door has overpriced drinks so cruise over to natural grocers first.
Chicanas Tacos,7,Hilariously  a taco truck is a rare enough thing in Hyde. Thankfully the tacos here are good and fresh. The guys in the truck are salty and not exactly personable. Doesn t really matter though  it s a taco from a truck -- you re not looking for world class customer service. It s reliably very fresh and very good. They re big tacos  overflowing with made to order ingredients. You re gonna have to wait though. Sometimes 20-25 minutes. There is shaded seating but if you re in a hurry  just go elsewhere.
La Traila #6,1,One of the YUMMIEST breakfast tacos  If your by the area you need to try their breakfast tacos I was wanting some food this morning and THANK GOODNESS for this little food truck by my work  I order a bacon egg and cheese taco and a potato egg and cheese both on flour. They were both a good size and nicely stuffed  Their green salsa is so good not spicy at all and I really liked that because I don t do spicy food. But the salsa gave it a nice kick taste with out the spiciness is that makes any sense   Definitely a quick pick up breakfast spot and I m sure I ll be going back. Now I ll need to try their lunch  I ll keep y all posted 
La Traila #6,2,Came here for breakfast and so glad we did  The woman working was super nice and they made the food quickly  The Trojan is huge and so good  I was only able to eat half while there  My husband got the la gringas and they are like quesadillas  so so yummy  This is located in a shell parking lot  can grab a soda from the convenient store  Stop by and get you some good eats 
La Traila #6,3,Excellent tacos  great red salsa  great salsa verde  and horchata. Quick made to order Mexican food. They have nopales for vegetarians.
Quick Fix Cuisine,1,I used to come here almost every other day when the truck was next to the shop . Their food is second to none when it comes to food and taste here in San Marcos. Every thing on their menu is special . You would be satisfied with anything you choose . Service is top tier and the ambiance of a food truck scene is a cool one .
Quick Fix Cuisine,2,I got the birria tacos and oh my goodness 10 10 they were great   I highly recommend getting them
Quick Fix Cuisine,3,The birria tacos were as good as the reviews promised--two tacos packed to the gills with tender  quality meat and a cup of chunky broth and chile oil  i think she referred to is as consomm   it s delicious and looked like stew  to dunk them in and a beautiful little lime to finish. It was more than I could eat in one go but I believe it would fill Mr R on a hungry day  and  13 is fair when you appreciate it was all cooked fresh from quality ingredients and tastes great on your plate.  Similarly  the smoothies contain actual recognizable produce full of goodness and are made when you order. There are 3 sizes depending on your appetite and budget. Very filling   The staff were extremely friendly  polite  and kind. When my juice wasn t ready with my food she brought me a water  and she happily offered to explain how the tacos broth are usually eaten.  I look forward to trying more of their menu in the near future. A twitter post said they ve been in business for four years  impressive even in normal times  food industry is tough  and when you taste their cooking you understand why.
Quick Fix Cuisine,4,I ordered the beef fried rice  Talk about delicious  They use grass fed beef and the cook that cooks here is from Thailand and her recipe is what they serve  it s so good  Not greasy  Packed with flavor  they served it with a peanut sauce and finely chopped peanuts on top  We mainly got it for my daughter so they put most the sauces on the side. I ended up eating it... ALL  lol Hands down best fried rice you ll ever have  And I m telling you  I NEVER order fried rice from anywhere bc I like my own but dang. That was awesome  The staff was super friendly  they give you those feel good vibes  like they ve known you forever  worth the stop  will definitely be coming back  I do want to add this is actually located in the red bus food park on 801 chestnut st. You can buy alcohol from the red bus.
Quick Fix Cuisine,5,The birria tacos are so full of meat and the taco stays crunchy  Also their mango lime juice is delicious  Definitely coming here again.
Quick Fix Cuisine,6,I was so pleased with this great business  we were amazed by the quality of the food  and the customer service provided by Marcus. Him and his partner were super helpful and made sure we were taken care of. He was so kind in dealing with a transaction mistake and was super communicative with us  such a good energy all around. The food was ASTOUNDING and we will absolutely be going back. Thank you for a wonderful night 
Quick Fix Cuisine,7,Literally the best food I ve ever eaten and I cook a lot at home. The owner and her family are amazing. Their business and the care that April takes with quality of their items is unmatched. Fav items on the menu right now are the elote  street corn  and the Pambazo. The juices are amazing too.
Quick Fix Cuisine,8,This place is so good  Birria tacos are excellent and the blueberry lemonade is like nothing you would expect    So good    The owners are super nice too    My husband and I will be making the 2 hour drive to eat here again       And dreaming about the Birria until then 
Quick Fix Cuisine,9,I have to eat GF. Horrid life.  Trying new places but I can tell off the bat if the chefs are knowledgeable. They are MORE than knowledgeable  changed some things on their own so that I could enjoy yumminess. Add in the extreme deliciousness  that combo makes my heart flutter. Will be back for sure 
Quick Fix Cuisine,10,Delicious Birria   Meat is very tender and very flavorful the broth is flavorful as well. Staff is friendly  Definitely coming back and recommend 
Quick Fix Cuisine,11,The Birria tacos go hard as f    man  20 out of 10  It s been a long time since I ve been to a place where the meat and broth have the distinct flavor to the crispy tortilla with cilantro cabbage  onion and cheese. They also serve fresh  amp  tasty beverages instead of the usual fake concentrate juice or powder packets. If you haven t been you should  Because once you try it  YOU WILL WANT TO GO BACK      Great people behind it as well.
Quick Fix Cuisine,12,This place is sooo good  Just landed in Austin  didn t know what I wanted to eat  Luckily came across a bunch of food trucks and that always a good sign for variety and tons of options. There was Cuban  Thai  BBQ...a few more trucks that I can t remember what they were serving BUT I did find myself coming back to Quick Fix..I should ve known since it was first option  I got the SOMALICIOUS  w shrimp  is DELICIOUS    Tasted fresh  the sauce that it comes with has a kick but so good  If they have a bottle of it I d buy it  The drinks are fresh and soooo GOOD     Blueberry cinnamon    not to mention the owners are down to earth and know good healthy food   I definitely will come back   
Quick Fix Cuisine,13,Shrimp and chorizo tacos are fire   Enjoyed every bite  friendly people and great food.
Quick Fix Cuisine,14,Stop by to get some drinks. They are amazing   He offered a taste of their 2 new drinks. They were so good I bought both of them.   Cucumber mint and raspberry cinnamon
Quick Fix Cuisine,15,Great customer service and even better attitude  ingredients. Ordered the birria tacos that come with the consume  and my mouth was already watering just by how they were explaining it. They gave us samples while we waited for our food  and the juices were Incredible. Definitely recommend to anybody that enjoys great street.
Quick Fix Cuisine,16,Quick Fix was so freaking good  April really cares about the quality of her food and the ingredients she uses. The Birria tacos and the pambazo sandwich were amazing  We will definitely be coming back   
Quick Fix Cuisine,17,y all. i have followed this place on facebook for a long while  but finally ordered food from there yesterday.  this. place. is. AMAZING.  i got the chicken fried rice and the pb amp j. everything was so fresh  especially in the fried rice. it wasn t greasy or stale tasting like most fried rices seem to be from other places. the sauces on it made such a  great  difference.  the pb amp j was to have a sweet  amp  because it sparked my interest. when i say the bread on this sandwich was equivalent to the decadence of a good french toast  that would be modest.  give this place a try if you re on the fence - you won t regret it.
Quick Fix Cuisine,18,One of my favorite local food trucks - always fresh and healthy food options. I m not vegan but have tried their vegan tacos and can say they are DELICIOUS
Quick Fix Cuisine,19,We had the most amazing food here. My boyfriend got the tacos with the birria  which was unexpected because we d always seen this on twitter and wanted to try it for ourselves . I had some sweet meat with the rice. We tried their drinks  I got a blueberry one and I think my boyfriend got the one with lime. We absolutely loved our food and our drinks. Please come here and try it out for yourself 
Quick Fix Cuisine,20,Amazing food. They use grass-fed beef which is such a great touch. The owner was there and she was super friendly and informative. Pro tip  order their fresh herb and juice blends 
Quick Fix Cuisine,21,FIVE STARS ISNT ENOUGH      The food is FIRE. El fuego  all the flames in the world.   We got a sweet meat place which is caramelized grass fed beef on a bed of badass rice.  LITERALLY A HEAVEN SENT MEAL. don t even question it.   We also got a Jack flash with chicken  chef style. It s a sandwich made with all the love you could possibly imagine with a side of street freaking corn straight off the cob.   You get a free  shot of life  when you buy food  Which is a shot that s GREAT for your health  They truly care about you here   After you eat here you ll probably start dreaming of the food. But that s okay because it s all worth it    A must check out place            The owners are amazing  the employees are amazing and the food.... It does that talking itself.   To the owners  GOOD JOB ON THE CONCEPT  YALL KILLED IT   
Quick Fix Cuisine,22,After spending 5 minutes looking at menu items on an iPad  my buddy and I decided on the sweet meat. We also had a bottle of water. Total price with tip   36.  Now don t get the wrong the guys running the truck were super friendly but the portion was a little skimpy and face it  a little meat and rice for  13.50 isn t much of a value. I frequent food trucks and get much more elaborate meals for the same or cheaper price point.  The food was pretty tasty but I wouldn t pay over  10 for it in the future.
Quick Fix Cuisine,23,amazing   10 10 great food and the workers are even better. i will be coming back  great value and quality of food.  thank you april
Quick Fix Cuisine,24,Every single thing from customer service to the food was AMAZINGGG    They make sure to tell you how everything s made and how fresh everything is  I drove all the way from Austin to try it out and it was worth the drive    The sauces were so good   Their freshly made juices were SO refreshing   I mean just everything   Don t hesitate to give this place a try  even if you don t know what to get they will definitely guide you on the perfect choice  HIGHLY RECOMMEND AND WILL 100  BE BACK FOR MORE      
Quick Fix Cuisine,25,Very expensive.  14.00for two small biria taco.  Customer service is very rude.  I tried bringing up how expensive they are. Very nicely. And they attack me with their words. I will never go back. Friends ask where they can find a good biria and I send them to Austin.  More than half the price of these people.
Quick Fix Cuisine,26,TEXAN TACOS Remember that name  it s filling  but it s good I would asked for another 3.  This by far is my favorite order  the tacos are fat w  soft pinto beans  avocados  bell peppers  there s more  I forgot the name  see pic TEXAN TACO .  The dressing is mildly sweet  but ask for something else salty  or spicy because the tacos itself is already a good base. A little of any dressing ONLY satisfy your platter a little more. It s good  but teasing good  that is why I said   it s good I would asked for another 3. 
Quick Fix Cuisine,27,The food and hospitality here was perfect. They definitely know how to make some mean dishes  Even their homemade juices are super delicious and refreshing 
Quick Fix Cuisine,28,Although I really don t like the name of this place for some reason  the food is the complete opposite. The whole theme menu ingredients of the food truck is so cool  There are options for anyone- seafood  meat  vegetarian  and vegan  They also give you a free  shot of life  with any order which was great. It has cayenne pepper  honey  apple cider vinegar  and some other stuff for a great concoction good for digestion and woke me up really quick. They also give 10  off if you bring your dog  I ordered the Vegan Somalicious with Chicken and I liked it  but I also didn t. However  that was due to personal preference. For the vegan part  it had fried jackfruit which I do not like at all  even though its a great option. The chicken was really good though  It was grilled nicely and I could tell it was made with the upmost quality. For me  I really needed more spice and flavors but this could be due to not choosing the right dish.  I also tried the power up smoothie which was sweet and tasted just like a smoothie should. However  it does have a lot of seeds in it due to the ingredients in it. There was one drink I tasted that consisted of cucumber and mint which was really good  It was fresh and naturally sweet.   I do want to go back and try the vegan burger  they were sold out   and some more of the smoothies and drinks. The concept is amazing and I love their vibe  The prices of the dishes are quite expensive for being a food truck  but you pay for the concept and quality.
Quick Fix Cuisine,29,I wasn t particularly enticed by the name or outside of the trailer so I looked at it last in the park. The owners were so friendly  though  that I ended up trying alligator because I ve never had alligator. It was one of the most delicious foods I ve had in ages  I have tried something different off of the menu every time I ve been here since and haven t looked at another trailer in the park. I have also had a Thai-inspired dish with skewered shrimp that knocked it out of the park. Everything is fresh and delicious  nothing overcooked  very flavorful.  The owners also made me a shot of some crazy stuff while I was waiting that probably quick-fixed something in my gut. And their juices are juicy juicy.  On numerous occasions  the owners have run food out to me in the rain. They are kind and delightful folks who will cook for any dietary restrictions you can throw at them.  I really think that if Quick Fix had a name that didn t sound like a convenience store  they d top lists in Austin. As it is  I m glad that one of the best food trucks in Austin to serve delicious  healthy food doesn t have a crazy line.
Quick Fix Cuisine,30,My FAVORITE spot to stop on the east side. The gang that runs the show is absolutely wonderful  amp  fun. If you need a quick fix  this is literally what you re looking for.
Quick Fix Cuisine,31,I got the chicken and rice. Super good food  really good price but the thing that I liked best was portion size. Big portions  Also the sweet tea was crazy delicious.
Quick Fix Cuisine,32,My first review on Yelp and I just felt compelled to spare my awesome experience   This has a variety of healthy but exciting options  from apps to entrees  homemade juices and healthfood shots  and more  Nothing artificial and very conscientious about health while still being satisfying. Options for carnivores to vegans   I happened across Quick Fix while seeking out a different food truck  but this happened to be the only one open. While I was considering the menu  the owner of the truck introduced himself and offered to help me choose something to suit my taste. This was really helpful  as he explained that all of their recipes are their own creation and not based on any specific type of food. I recommend asking for suggestions  you will not be disappointed.  Yelp says this is a  juice bar vegan  food truck  however the majority of their offerings include protein items cooked deliciously without excessive grease or frying.  At the suggestion of the owner  I went with the Shrimp Stacks. They are FANTASTIC  Freshly sauteed jumbo shrimp with avocado atop thinly sliced sweet potato with a homemade slighty spicy sauce. 10 10 for flavor  texture  and creativeness  satisfying after a workout but not heavy or guilt inducing. I would absolutely order this again.  I also got to try their homemade strawberry lemon limeade. Delicious and refreshing  without any added sugars  and a fabulous twist of mint at the finish.  Last of all  service. It wasn t until after I ordered that I realized that they had already been closed for AN HOUR and yet continued to provide excellent service with a smile. Prices are reasonable  it s delicious fresh food and you get what you pay for. I will absolutely bring my friends here. Don t miss out on this great  family owned establishment 
Quick Fix Cuisine,33,I don t usually leave reviews but this place definitely deserves one    Fresh ingredients Immaculate presentation Downright good food  I had the shrimp and chicken fried rice with  the works   Hands-down the best fried rice in Austin  Texas  And if they re serving strawberry lemonade when you visit...do yourself a favor and grab one. Strawberry to lime ratio is on point.
Quick Fix Cuisine,34,Enjoyed our visit here  Really friendly service  free  shot of life  and a great concept utilizing localized source food. They also accept Litecoin.  Food was great too  I got shrimp skewers and my wife got quesadillas. They also make their own drinks smoothies which I ll have to try next time.
Quick Fix Cuisine,35,OMG I got Vegan burger  was very delicious tasty and very different  Thank you so much guys I ll definitely be back    
Quick Fix Cuisine,36,Came by the food truck park on a Sunday afternoon and didn t really know what I wanted...  I was promptly greeted by a super friendly guy once I approached the menu and he explained to me that everything is healthy and sourced locally.  I needed a GF option for my boyfriend so he asked the chef to speak with me when she finished cooking.  She recommended the Somalicious over rice  which consists of grilled beef with a green sauce and a spicy raspberry jelly sauce on the side.  I had the Roll It Up  which are onions and peppers wrapped with rib eye strips paired with their delicious fried rice.  Every order comes with a free shot of life--super tasty   Overall we really enjoyed the food and my boyfriend was damn near licking the plate clean.  They have amazing sauces made in-house that paired beautifully with the dishes we had.  I love that the trailer is so conveniently located and can t wait to be back 
Quick Fix Cuisine,37,This is a phenomenal food truck   Healthy  light  fast  delicious and clean   This is definitely going to be a staple in my running arounds.
Quick Fix Cuisine,38,I would leave 10 stars if I could  Welcoming and accommodating service. Flavorful  fresh  and beautiful food. Austin has a lot of competition when it comes to food trucks  but this is the best experience we ve had  We d make a special trip to come back.
Quick Fix Cuisine,39,The food here was absolutely amazing  It came out nice and hot and truly five stars isn t enough. The cucumber lemonade taste incredible in the summer heat. What stood out the most...was the service  Marcus at the window guided us through the menu options  and April killed it in the back making the food. We will definitely be returning because this food was sensational and I ve never been more okay with spending money on food.
Quick Fix Cuisine,40,Love the foods  very tasteful and a friendly order guys. I m not really speak good English but he tried  to figure out which  orderI looking for. This one the second time I tried this place. And my daughter from Hawaii she love it
Quick Fix Cuisine,41,Noting the review below  I noticed that there was no  paleo  written anywhere on the menu... what I did find when I walked up to the truck were two extremely friendly business owners and some of the best food truck food in Austin.  I ordered  The Sticks  with chicken and  The Block Style . The fried rice wasn t too greasy oily or heavy and the meat was impressively tender  that shrimp is bomb and I don t like shrimp .  I trust the chef though- I d feel safe ordering anything on the menu and looking forward to my next go 
Quick Fix Cuisine,42,My wife and I went yesterday and had the birria tacos for the first time. They were so incredibly good  and the consomme is to die for. I think I found my new favorite food.
Quick Fix Cuisine,43,super delicious but overpriced especially with a location meant for college students to access. i had the birria tacos and they were so good but 14     most taco places charge anywhere from 4-9  for 3 tacos and the consome  but here it was 2 for 14. that s a little ridiculous in my humble opinion. i d try to find a different spot  especially if you re a broke college student like the rest of us   
Quick Fix Cuisine,44,Habanero berry quesadillas    OMG so so good    Definitely not what I was expecting  we went with an open mind and the guy recommended these and boy was he right  Y all definitely need to try these  So delicious  Thanks so much for being so kind and answering our questions and recommendations  We will be coming back here when we visit Austin again
Quick Fix Cuisine,45,I ll go ahead and add to the previous great reviews. The roll it up combo  fire. I had it today for lunch and yes  I have leftovers. The grilled shrimp and pineapple skewers  SO DAMN GOOD. And how can you go wrong with peppers and onions wrapped in steak  So good. So good.
Quick Fix Cuisine,46,I was in the area and stumbled upon this awesome food truck.   So friendly and they even customized my meal to fit my diet.   Very fresh and so delicious   
Quick Fix Cuisine,47,Delicious food    Had the quesadillas with sweet habanero sauce - really unique and just right. The owner and her husband are sweet as can be. Great service  loved it 
Quick Fix Cuisine,48,Great vegan burger  Healthy ingredients  flavorful  and a filling patty. Definitely will be back.
Quick Fix Cuisine,49,I ate my food too fast to take a picture but the quesadillas were amazing  And customer service is great  
Quick Fix Cuisine,50,Stopped by here on a whim and was not disappointed. I had the Stacks which was excellent. All the food is fresh  nothing fried. They focus on healthy ingredients and as if that weren t enough they re family run. We also tried their newest drink which was a Blueberry Lemonade with locally sourced cinnamon stick boiled in  uhhh yum 
Quick Fix Cuisine,51,Very good smoothies  got a free shot of some spicy ginger thing. The guy was extremely friendly. Will come back to try the food.
Quick Fix Cuisine,52,Cancel your dinner plans. Eat here. I spent a week basically just eating in Austin  and the food here but everything else  including restaurants that were significantly more expensive. Do yourself a favor  head over ASAP.
Quick Fix Cuisine,53,It s a food truck with an Amazing menu  Fresh and flavorful    The shrimp quesadillas and the stack were delicious  Fresh gulf shrimp and guacamole made this delicious along with the fresh herbs  cilantro .  I would eat here again at any time. They also have these refreshing homemade lemonades made with things like strawberries and key lime and blueberries with a cinnamon stick. I love their take on vegan  fresh and flavorful without the extra oils. Great job  You won t be disappointed   
Quick Fix Cuisine,54,SHOULD BE ILLEGAL    They say crack is addictive....they have no idea the power of Quick Fix Cuisine. 7 our of 5 stars      
Quick Fix Cuisine,55,Fabulous food and owner. Must try. I got the Roll It up. So juicy when you bite into the meat  you have to keep your mouth closed otherwise some will fish out   Flavorful and the rice was also perfect.
Quick Fix Cuisine,56,This is truly an excellent place to get food. They have lots of healthy  delicious options that they re happy to adjust to any diet  and the prices are very fair for the amount and quality of food you re getting. In terms of this  paleo  nonsense that other reviewers have referred to  it s everyone s individual responsibility to make sure their diet is accommodated  not the chef s  and I can t imagine the chef having any problem helping someone out if their needs were communicated. We got to spend some time getting to know the owner and talking to his family  who all work in the truck and have great attitudes and personalities. Extremely compassionate people who are genuinely interested in making the meal as good as it can get - and it was  I got the shrimp somalicious  spelling   and it was truly delicious. Well-seasoned  fresh ingredients  and beautiful to look at  The owner showed me pictures of the food instead of handing me a menu full of words and described each dish as it came up. It s clear that he s invested in this business  not just for his own benefit but for the benefit of his customers.  I will absolutely go out of my way to return here in the future  I love this place and cannot recommend it enough.
Quick Fix Cuisine,57,I ordered the Sweet Tooth via Uber Eats. The food was tasty  and the portion was great  The sweet potato had been roasted just enough  and the turkey and veggies were well-seasoned. My only complaint is that the menu descriptions are not precise enough. I ordered the Sweet Tooth because  as it is described on the menu  it is a paleo dish. When the dish arrived  I was a little disappointed to see that it was topped with corn and cheese  both items outside of the paleo diet. That being said  it was still delicious  and I don t mind the mini-cheat meal. I ll be ordering from here again  making sure to specify the paleo requirements.
Quick Fix Cuisine,58,The food s extremely good  the guy working the order window is really nice  and your order gets to you pretty fast  I recommend getting either the sweet meat or the fried rice  I can t get enough of either 
Quick Fix Cuisine,59,We stopped in tonight after a run around the lake. Great folks running the trailer and super tasty food. Get one of their fresh drinks and the Sweet Meat. Tasty 
Quick Fix Cuisine,60,Everything is so fresh even the staff. It is family owned and you can tell in the quality of the food. I go every time I m in Austin  Sometimes I even make a drive out just for the fried rice.
Quick Fix Cuisine,61,A true Austin hidden gem. I don t usually go out and try new foods because my income is pretty limited  but I am so so glad I gave this place a chance  The owners were super nice and took time to show us  explain all the different foods on the menu  and we even got free samples of an amazing fruity lemonade with mint  which we ended up buying the full drink because it was so good . It was really hard to decide what to get because everything looked amazing  but I ended up trying  the stacks   pictured  which was real gulf shrimp  way better than farmed-taste and health wise  and avocado on top of a slice of sweet potato topped with cilantro and cilantro sauce. I even got to try out the fruity habanero sauce and it was amazing-right amount of kick and sweetness. The portion size was great and the presentation was beautiful. Highly recommend this place  I cannot wait to go back and try their other food 
Quick Fix Cuisine,62,I went to quick fix cuisine and ordered the shrimp fried rice and sweet meat. Both were amazing dishes and everything was made fresh to order. As I was ordering  I saw someone s shrimp quesadilla order which look equally amazing. I will be trying the quesadilla for sure next time    So happy with this place  definitely recommend to anyone and everyone  There is something for everyone  can t wait to make my way through their menu.
Quick Fix Cuisine,63,Came to this place on the way to my workout. Food is delicious. I m not a shrimp fan but I had their kebab and it was awesome. Deff stop by this truck if you re in the area.
Quick Fix Cuisine,64,if you think this place looks good in the pictures just wait till you try it in person  Wow  they know exactly what they re doing here. Amazing food very friendly and fast  five star for sure and will be back soon 
Quick Fix Cuisine,65,I ve never had anything like it. The peanut butter and jelly sandwich is the best I ve ever had in my life. Ever. Never even thought about doing it the way they do. The coconut rice with blueberries was amazing. The drink  with roasted cinnamon is refreshing. All of it super healthy. Then they give you a cider vinegar shot that s good for your immune system. Great tasting food  and good service 
Quick Fix Cuisine,66,this place is AMAZING  The sweet meat and the Maui wowie  shrimp kabobs  are awesome. I didn t have enough space in my stomach to try everything else but I will definitely be back to eat the rest of the menu.
Quick Fix Cuisine,67,The food was absolutely amazing and I ll be coming back soon to get the shrimp stacks again  Delicious variety spread across the whole menu 
Quick Fix Cuisine,68,I went to Quick Fix over the weekend because Ive heard so many great things about the food truck. On my visit I was ordering for 10 different people  we ordered the fried rice  sweet potato shrimp stacks  sweet meat  my personal favorite   and the quesdillas with a habanero berry sauce. Everything we ordered was amazing  It was the perfect option for my group because the food was fresh  bright  and more importantly healthy. Besides the food being out of this world  the food truck owners are great people  If you re not sure what to order  ask Marcus or K for recommendations  every recommendation was on point. I recommend everyone in Austin to try the food truck 
Quick Fix Cuisine,69,Downloaded yelp just to leave a good review  this place deserves it  The food is unique  healthy   amp  full of flavor. The workers went out of their way to make sure we had everything we needed. Will definitely be back again  
Quick Fix Cuisine,70,I wasn t sure what to expect when I first came here. But no doubt  the. Best. Quesadilla. I ve. Ever. Had. Their food is so unique and healthy I will definetely be back to try more of the menu. Bonus the people who run it are are just as awesome  10 10 would recommend.
Quick Fix Cuisine,71,Took a very spontaneous trip for a quick dinner before my flight. My fam decided to go get some BBQ but I decided to go look around the other food trucks. The other one that was only open was Quick Fix Cuisine. The guy was very welcoming and explained everything in the menu as thorough as possible. He recommended the sweet meat with gator. I have never had gator ever in my life.... and let me tell you  this is one of the most delicious food I ve ever tasted. I would definitely come back again and I am definitely gonna bring people and recommended the exact same order that I got. Overall  AMAZING.
Quick Fix Cuisine,72,Marcus and April are awesome  The food is the bomb    I will totally come eat here again    
Quick Fix Cuisine,73,This place is top notch. Food is as great as the people serving it to you  You can tell they take pride in their product everything from plating to flavors. I unfortunately snapped my food and forgot to save it  ugh. I got the Toasted and my friend got the shrimp quesadillas. Every bite was devoured. Luckily I live in the neighborhood so I will be back 
Quick Fix Cuisine,74,Super friendly people and the sweet meat is the best meal I ve had from a food truck. My girlfriend and I shared it and was more than enough.
Quick Fix Cuisine,75,Not only is the food amazing  the owners are some of the nicest people I ve met. Nothing but good vibes and phenomenal bites at this one of a kind food truck. Keep it up guys   _ 
Quick Fix Cuisine,76,This place was delicious  We stopped by here after a bike ride in the park and we were very happy. Honestly  I was a bit skeptical with the big menu on the sign they had in front of the truck  I couldn t really tell what everything was from the picture or the labels. But one we talked to the guys in the truck we were hooked. Everything is home cooked and super fresh. I can t recommend the  Maui wowie  highly enough. It s shrimp and pineapple skewers and You gets loads of food for the price of the meal that come with rice and guacamole and a spicy sauce. My partner had the Somalicious  which was good but smaller for the price and could have come with more sauce. The best thing about this place though is the drinks. They made a strawberry mint limeade to order which was super fresh. We also had this wonderful coconut banana mint juice which was perfect after a bike ride. Highly recommended.
Quick Fix Cuisine,77,Friendly  fast  and delicious healthy food  If you re health conscious or if you think healthy food can t taste good this food truck is for you. One of the best in town 
Kins Dining,1,Wow  even though J2 Dining Hall and Kinsolving are in the same dining umbrella  for some weird odd reason  Kinsolving serves better buffet cafeteria style food than J2  don t ask me why... I still wonder till this very day .  I feel that Kinsolving has more variety and a better quality of campus food. I appreciate their cleanliness  environment and eating atmosphere inside and out. There is lots of food lines for all different tastes and palettes  and the quality of it is quite impressive   I think one of my favorites is their yogurt bar  where you can add fruit  toppings and other healthy options. It s probably one of the best things that campus has to offer in a buffet line. Along with the other food being offered everyday  we cannot stop this review unless we add the Saturday evening meal  which is so much better than their daily activity of food.  If I had to choose my favorite on campus dining service  go to Kinsolving in North Campus. You won t regret it 
Kins Dining,2,There s a lot of good reviews  here. Most of what people say is true  the people are very nice. the  service is fast  and the location is convenient. The food is dirt cheap  if you re a student. Problem is  the food tastes cheap. I think there  should be at least one review that harps on the issues with kinsolving  dining  so here is a list  - The tofu is gross and soft - The soups are bland - The chicken is dry - Vegetables are overcooked and unseasoned -  The carrots manage to be too hard on the inside and too  soft on the outside - The servers put everything on top of everything else. Be prepared to have  those soggy vegetables poured directly on top of your bread - The pita bread is always stale - The day-old pita is instead called  naan  - Anything pasta related is overcooked and almost porridge-like  including ravioli  lasagna  etc.  - All the fruit has been covered in sugar - The cottage cheese is across from the yogurt so there s always cottage cheese in the yogurt - The syrup with breakfast is literally corn syrup - The granola is crushed up nature valley bars. Not bad  but really sweet. - The milk tastes like water - The meat is extremely tough  like inedibly so - Any stand-alone meat is usually not great - Any cheese is velveeta - The rice is stiff minute rice - The broccoli is way too big so it s overcooked on the outside and underdone on the inside - The fries are sometimes wet  like they steamed them - The tomatoes are stiff  cold  and gross - The eggs are powdered - The pizza is absolutely awful. Like  bare crust with ranch and a salad on it.  ...and now for the good parts  - All the fast food is fine  burgers  fried chicken  tater tots  etc. - Salads are fine - Large cereal selection - Decent orange juice - What they call  pass-o-guava  is tasty - Lots of sodas if that s your thing - Good hummus and crackers - The fruit  although sweet  is still decent - Good stir fry  when they have it - Specials are in general decent - Gourmet nights on saturdays that are in general good - Beans are good when they have them - Rice is sometimes better than just minute rice - The head cook is a great guy. I honestly think food tastes better when he serves it. -  Quesadillas  and  flautas  are alright but absolutely not what they advertise to be - Same can be said of their  indian food  - They have this vegetarian brussel sprouts dish and I honestly think it s the only time I ve ever liked brussel sprouts. - Breakfast food is decent - Good tacos - I ve heard they have decent wraps  though I haven t had them myself. - Desserts are decent  if a little sweet - Soft serve is decent  if a little watery - Seriously  a friendly staff makes the food taste twice as good - Sour cream is inoffensive - Coffee is okay  if a little weak  sweet. - Pizza is sometimes ok -  Veggie patties  are tasty.  That s all I can think of right now. It s enough to get you through the year  and is very cost-efficient. I worry about any vegans or vegetarians  because sometimes the fried food line is the only good thing  but for  most people it s decent enough for dorm life. I also heard about people developing celiac disease from just eating fried chicken and burgers  so uh don t do that i guess
Kins Dining,3,Of the two unlimited dining halls on campus  J2 and Kins  I think Kins is slightly better. Kins is smaller  cleaner  friendlier  and it has quiet seating areas  inside and out. Most of the food between the two dining halls is about the same. I think the food taste decent early in the semester but that it gets old. If you re a student  try to diversify your diet by eating off campus and using your dining dollars at the campus cafes.   The food here is just okay.
Kins Dining,4,Sucks I hate it makes me want to mosey on out forever  sad cowboy emoji  does not make me want to yeehaw or ride em cowboy or alright alright alright not 5 7 perfect score big chungus made me drop out of college
Kins Dining,5,Kins has the nicest service and a surprisingly good selection of food  They re super dedicated to responding to student comments and updating their menu frequently  They also serve bagels from wholy bagel which is pretty incredible. Better than J2 by a long shot.
Kins Dining,6,Oh  the grand Kinsolving buffet  With one admission to the Kinsolving buffet  you can help yourself to a marvelous European style continental banquet. Complete with everything  forbidden fruit  tiny plums  orange melons  green leaves  colored platters  and oh so much more delicacies bound to electrify your deepest salivary glands  The Kinsolving buffet is not merely a simple buffet  not just a modest cafeteria  but something fulfilling to the spirit  a flabbergasting yet astonishingly enlightening experience for the ages that questions your existence with every mouthful.  Oh  where should we fly to first  Located at the back of the eatery is Chef s Features  much like a jewel hidden in the warm sands of an oasis. Every day at the Chef s Features contains a novel experience like the joy of twisting the innovative cereal dispensers to the anticipation of the savory crunch of Lucky Charms. Next  buckle up  as we visit the lush fields of Farmer s Garden  Here  the salad is fresh and invigorating while the dressings flow like water cascading down Iguazu Falls in Argentina. A true delight to the senses  Our last destination but surely not for long  Sweet Sensations caresses you in an amiable embrace and fondles your taste buds with a tingling  honeyed touch  sending you off on Whitis Avenue with an insatiable craving for more. And to think that all of this comes with the room  Oh  what will you think of next  Kinsolving buffet 
Kins Dining,7,This place was my friends and my favorite place to eat on campus when I lived in Simkins Dorm. In fact  my buds and I still like to come eat here from time to time because of the good times we ve had and the food we enjoyed.  Everyday  groups of us would walk up Dean Keeton St. to  K-town   as I nicknamed it  to enjoy a variety of foods at a reasonable price with our Dine-in Dollars. My favorite dishes were chicken chrispitos  big crunchy taquitos with cheese inside   spicy chicken burgers  a wide variety of wraps  and their quesadillas. Albeit  the food here isn t 5 star  but there is a wide variety everyday and if your a student in the residence halls  its the best option for price and food. There is plenty of seating space and a somewhat homey feel you can get if you re there with plenty of friends.  Price  if you re using dine-in dollars  its a steal. if your paying cash or credit its still a good deal  but there are better options for your buck.  Competition  K-town s biggest competition is J2 the buffet dining hall on the other side of campus . K-town has J2 beat in the aesthetics dept  and the food quality and price is essentially the same.  I d recommend this place to anyone living on campus or looking for a filling meal while at UT  but for everyone else  its not something to go out of your way for.  Why I especially liked it  going to K-town wasn t just going to get food  it was a bonding time with my friends from Simkins  a great place for us all to go hangout  eat  and have the craziest conversations without worrying about making a fool out of ourselves.
Kins Dining,8,Good buffet style dining hall.  The current lunch price is  8.50 total  including tax .  They have sandwiches  wraps  daily entrees  pasta  potatoes  a mediocre salad bar  ice cream  cereal  make-your-own waffles  excellent .    Overall  it s one of the best places to eat on campus when you re hungry for a full meal.
Kins Dining,9,It s inside the Kinsolving dorm building  but it s open to the public.  A decent buffet at a decent price.  Lots of choices  and the main entrees  along the back wall  area different each day.  Decent salad bar  pizza  pasta  sandwiches  cereal  etc.  The make-your-own waffles are great  get the strawberry sauce that s by the other entrance .
Trill foods,1,This is one of those places you are always looking for. The food was unreal.    The fried chicken was perfect. The pickles sent it over the top. Lamb tacos  wow  just fu  ing wow.  Stop looking for somewhere else and to eat and go.
Trill foods,2,Located next to Cuantos Tacos and a handful of other food trucks . One of the few trucks open for lunch  on a Saturday when we went . There is plenty of parking and outdoor seating only since this is a food truck. When I went  they offered chicken and waffles and a few other items  but I couldn t resist the breakfast boudin sliders and po boys. Boudin balls were filled with duck  pork  rice  and spices. It was packed full of flavor. Good for sharing if you also want to try their giant po boys. They are huge  I m not vegetarian  but The Swiss mushroom po boy was awesome. Very savory. We were so full  Bring water 
Trill foods,3,Amazing tacos  I tried one of each of the four offered as a mix and match. Extremely delicious  You do have to commit after your first bite as they are juicy. My surprise favorite was the sweet potato taco although the lamb and pork were phenomenal. Attached to Vacancy brewing which is also amazing. Outdoor patio and indoor seating. Great stop 
Trill foods,4,This place is incredible-- food is always fresh and creative. Everything I ve had is a 10 10  
Trill foods,5,Honestly  15 for a plate of sweet potatoes on 4 very small tortillas is pretty ridiculous and can t believe people fall for this.
Brendas All Natural,1,Amazing  authentic  great quality. Friendly staff and lots of options. Homemade tortillas. Fresh ingredients. Vegetarian vegan options. Salsa with an actual spicy kick. The aromas coming from their kitchen reminded me of my moms cooking when I was growing up. Just awesome. I ll definitely be back.
Brendas All Natural,2,We got here while the ladies were just opening up. All the groceries like the maza  corn flour   tomatoes  and eggs still hadn t been put away. Which is reassuring that everything is fresh and handmade. The ladies are so sweet  just like Hispanic moms. The green salsa is absolutely amazing and the tacos are stuffed  They re so good and taste so handmade.
Brendas All Natural,3,Amazing breakfast tacos   Lady was super friendly   Great job  This place is a must go to...Thinking about stopping by for lunch also.
Arturos taco truck,1,We ordered from here on a whim because they were one of the only places that were still open and taking orders after 10 30PM. I did not expect much other than some food to satisfy our drunchies.   We got the pollo  asada  and al pastor. Oh my goodness  they were all so flavorful  especially with the sauces and toppings that came packaged on the side  The tacos were pretty small  so I would order maybe one or two more than you normally would.   I think the most meaningful food experiences are the good ones that catch you off guard. My only regret is not discovering Arturo s Tacos earlier in my visit.
Arturos taco truck,2,Tasted really bland and bad. I got quesadilla  amp  street tacos. street tacos had terrible tortilla. This place is not authentic.
Arturos taco truck,3,Like trying new food trucks  so decided to give this yellow truck one try. Dont even know where to start....the food was bland  the food was extra small. I ordered 2 sopes   at they danced all over the plate. Also ordered 2 tacos  this was a JOKE  I honestly wanted to go back and ask if this was for reals  if the sopes were small  dont be surprised when you see this tacos. I honestly thought the foil wrap was the limes or the cilantro and cebolla  but wow   When I opened the foil... It was the 2 tacos   Let me see in the photos that they are small  dont show them off as being regular size tacos. The torta is also in a small torta bread. The taste is not that great  maybe if the taste was better I would probably swing by to taste other stuff but with this experience I won t waste my time...
Arturos taco truck,4,This place was okay on a quick hurry  other than that there are better choices. I got the street tacos and they were tiny for the price. In my opinion they shouldn t be more than at most  2.  1.50 preferred. Thats how little they were. my 4yr old ate 3  I also got a quesadilla and it was meh. Not the worst but eatable.
Arturos taco truck,5,Ordered the carne asada friesZ it was a huge portion and definitely filling and taste great. Will order again if ever in Austin again.
Arturos taco truck,6,Last week was my first time seeing this food truck. Why not give it a try..... I have to say that they sure didn t disappoint at all. The food was good even my wife enjoy it.
Arturos taco truck,7,The best taco in Austin Texas      all the meat are fresh... I highly recommend this place
Arturos taco truck,8,Ordered quesadillas and alambres from here for the coworkers and myself. Good price for great food. Everyone enjoyed 
Taqueria Su Destino,1,My first legit Mexican food truck experience.  I ordered pastor and barbacoa corn tacos. Not only were they amazing but the presentation was also great -- on a clay-fired platter   I chose tamarind soda for my drink. Amazng as well.  Kudos to the great food and friendly service at this joint 
Taqueria Su Destino,2,So good. If you re trying to eat tacos made by a lady who only speaks Spanish at 10 30pm on a Wednesday night under the safety of a picnic tarp and Christmas lights  this is it. This is your destiny. This is su Destino.
Taqueria Su Destino,3,Hands down THE best tacos in Austin   I ve been coming here for three years and Jessica and her husband are dishing out the finest quality Mexican street food North of the Colorado River. They make a mean tlacoyo as well  and if you don t know what that is  just try it. You won t be disappointed 
Big Delicious Food,1,The Philly Chop Shop is life changing. Ask for the special BBQ sauce with it  The Beef Cake taco was great too. Tasted very fresh and juicy with all the avacado 
Big Delicious Food,2,The trailer looks awesome   but the food is even better  Everything is focused on smoked meat  but there s a good mix of sandwiches and tacos  Everything I ve had has been great  but the Pastrami is the best pastrami I ve ever had. It s also. I ve their menu allows you to get single tacos for  4  tons of meat  They re currently at Friends  amp  Allies brewing on the east side Sundays  check the calendar  it s not every Sunday  and the food pairs great with a brew. Highly recommend checking them out 
Big Delicious Food,3,By far the best bbq good truck in Austin.  He does catering too   You have to try their brisket and smoked pastrami.
Eighteenth Over Austin,1,My husband and I ate here for dinner last Thursday night.  I was expecting a way different ambiance since it is a restaurant at the top of the Hilton.  Unfortunately  the whole room was brightly lit with cheap furniture.  However  the service and the food were amazing   We ordered some mixed drinks which were very good as well. My husband had the tuna tartar and I had tortilla soup and a chicken Caesar salad.  My food was very good  but the tuna tartar my husband has was awesome   Also  the waitstaff  both a waiter and a waitress that worked together  were very courteous and made sure to inform us that the kitchen was going to take a bit longer with our food since the cooks were preparing meals for the large group behind us.  I gave this place only four stars because they need to make the decor and lighting way more elegant and romantic for evening  and they need way more staff in the kitchen.
Eighteenth Over Austin,2,The view at this restaurant is the best in Austin  The staff was friendly and accommodating with anything I needed to make my meal better. I had breakfast here three mornings in a row and loved the omelette table. The cook will make them however you wish and they have all the ingredients for any type of omelette you like. I enjoyed having breakfast and watching the sun come up each morning.  It was a great way to start the day  I would like to come back for dinner next time I m in Austin to watch the sun go down. I m sure that view is beautiful as well.
Eighteenth Over Austin,3,Card machine did not work  no posting or explanation of actual costs. This restaurant is not afraid to charge you for the most expensive option for no reason. Check your receipts. Nice view  better biscuits.
Eighteenth Over Austin,4,Don t even.  Waitress was sweet.  Food inedible.  Literally.   Went with friends.  Was told not to order steak.  Not with tonight s chef.   Soup so pasty it stuck to the roof of your mouth.  Chicken fried steak burned and totally dry.  Avoid.
Eighteenth Over Austin,5,For a hotel restaurant  I was impressed with Eighteenth Over Austin. The cook at the omelet waffle station will hook up you with whatever your heart desires. There are also bins of egg  meats  etc bins on other tables as well as pastries  oatmeal  amp  grits on another table. The service could definitely use some work as it takes too long to get water  creamer  etc.
Eighteenth Over Austin,6,Wow  The view is amazing and ambience is great  The Happy Hour was outstanding with  4 wells and wine from 4 00-6 30PM. With this amazing view  I am not sure why the place was not packed as this is probably the best view in Austin. I would recommend stopping by for Happy Hour and enjoying a good priced sip.
Eighteenth Over Austin,7,We stayed at the Hilton Garden Inn Downtown and ate breakfast each day at the top floor restaurant.  We thought it had a nice selection with an agreeable price. The view is fantastic. We ate early enough to essentially watch the sun rise over Austin. That was great 
Eighteenth Over Austin,8,5 stars for the Buffet breakfast. It s awesome. They are very efficient  know that you probably want to get in and out. The food  great omelet station  and service are great and the view is a nice surprise in the morning. Dinner  on the other hand is 3 stars. I sat at the bar and met some other people stuck here from the ice storm. The bartender was quite overwhelmed  it wasn t packed  just a general flow of patrons  so service was slow. I kept it healthy with the Quinoa Wrap which tasted much better than it looked. I would definitely come back and stay here next time I m in town  but might venture down the street for dinner if I didn t have a lot if time.
Eighteenth Over Austin,9,I tried to take my boyfriend here for his 30th birthday  because he likes skyscrapers- and I thought a view of downtown austin would befit such an interest. Most of the time we like cheap eats  casual places. But it was his 30th birthday so I waned to surprise him with something a little nicer.   So just to make sure  I called ahead and asked to reserve a seat near a window at 7 00 pm. I knew nothing of the place  so I wasn t sure if it was going to be busy or not and I didn t want to chance it. The hostess on the phone giggled when she took down the information  which I admit is hilarious  right  Table for two near a window at a restaurant at 7 00 pm     ROTFLMAO    So that part wierded me out  but we showed up anyway at 7 00pm and walked into...AN EMPTY dining room. No one was in there  No bartender  no hostess  no waiters and most of all  no patrons   At 7 00 pm   What is wrong with this place 
Eighteenth Over Austin,10,If you re staying at the HGI  you ll probably eat here at least once during your stay. Breakfast is free for Platinum and Gold HH members. The breakfast buffet is just okay - typical hotel breakfast - though I was happy they serve grits. I haven t been a fan of their omelette chef - he tends to overcook them and I ve given him a couple chances to get it right.   If you are contemplating whether to eat here for lunch or dinner  I can talk you out of it in a hurry. Their salads are decent and very large  but everything else I ve eaten is just meh. The burger was not well flavored at all. The saving grace was the jalapeno roll  but it s not worth spending  14 on a meh burger with a great bun. My friend s shrimp was overcooked and didn t have any flavor to it even though it was wrapped with bacon.   Coming up here for a drink would be fine - if you get Drew as your bartender  he is nerdy eye candy and makes strong drinks but is easily distracted.  I will say that the view up here is amazing  but that s not a good enough reason to give it more than 2 stars.
Eighteenth Over Austin,11,How sad.  Came here after not having been here for a long time.  When I came here before  it had just opened and they were were really excited  had a good chef and I was expecting great things.   Well  nothing happened.  They clearly do not have the same chef.   They took everything even remotely yummy off the menu.  The only burger they had was  14.  NUTS.  Everything else was similarly over-priced and unimaginative  obviously catering only to the hotel guests from out -of-town who didn t want to leave the hotel  had expense accounts and didn t know any better.   The inside looked like a hotel banquet room rather than a restaurant  with cheap chairs  tables  etc.  In other words  upscale prices with downscale furniture and food.  Bad value all around  I say.  The burger   Well  it was tasty  but it was actually too big and the bun could not handle the meat.  The bun was good  but fell apart only 1 3 of the way through.    Having an 18th story view gave it such potential.  What a waste.
Eighteenth Over Austin,12,A very solid hotel breakfast buffet. Features an omelette station  but don t let the name fool you - they do made-to-order eggs  french toast and waffles as well.  The open buffet features an egg scramble  breakfast potatoes  biscuits  n gravy  and a bacon sausage station. Oatmeal  a selection of pastries and a fruit bar round out the offerings.  The fruit could have been a bit fresher  but then again I visited in early January and that s a tough time of year for fresh strawberries  honeydew melon  pineapple  etc.   No espresso service in the morning  which is unfortunate. Coffee is passable  I opted for tea instead.  Lunch dinner is also solid  if not a bit pricey. The menu has the usual American staples  all of which are decent.  A good way to grab some solid food while on the road. Not really the sort of place you d come to if you are a local  except for the great views of downtown Austin.
Eighteenth Over Austin,13,Meh  typical hotel bar. It does have an ok view. But you have the usual over priced drinks and food.
Eighteenth Over Austin,14,Nice dining room  beautiful view of downtown and great food...interesting food but not off the wall.  We had grilled yellowfin tuna the night we stayed  cooked perfect...It is a shame the place was empty.  We only knew of the place because we came to visit some friends  stayed at the hotel and one night we stayed in.  Our friends had never heard of the restaurant  we saw no signs anywhere...probably ought to try some advertising.
Taqueria La Paloma,1,This place has amazing food and great service  We really stumbled on it and we re so glad we did. We ordered tacos and quesadillas. Portions were good size and everything was really tasty. The owner cook server was friendly and seemed very happy to have us. We would definitely go back and recommend 
Taqueria La Paloma,2,For selfish reasons I debated writing this review. I m better than that so here it is. This hidden gem needs exposure and recognition  Austin has decent food trucks  but this is one of the most authentic Mexican trucks in town. The cook and waiter make the best duo in town. They make sure to check in on you and strive to make the dine-in experience as close as it is in their house. The mom and pop shop vibe is in full effect in this place.  I ve had the pupusas  tacos  enchiladas and quesadilla. They re all homemade  so be prepared to wait for greatness to be created by the hands of a grill master. The rice was mediocre  so i d skip the plates. I ll be back to try everything in here and update my review as it happens.
Taqueria La Paloma,3,Absolutely LOVE this place  They have it all and literally everything is good -- trust me  the husband and I go 1-2 times a week and have pretty much had everything on the menu. Tacos  pupusas  enchiladas  breakfast is all amazing 
Jack in the Box,1,The employee in the drive thru was very easy to understand and incredibly friendly.  She seemed to truly like her job. That s refreshing to see in a fast food establishment.  I ordered a small hamburger without the ketchup and mustard.  Instead I requested their Secret Sauce. This is the true test of a Jack in the Box employee. More than half of the time employees have no idea what I m talking about.  But not this time  Double stars to her simply for that  I arrived during the beginning of the lunch rush and anticipated a long wait  customers know things are made fresh  so it takes a bit longer here to get food as opposed to other chains--an acceptable trade off .  But to my surprise  my wait was short. Score  I drove away and checked my food and found my onion rings cooked to perfection and the hamburger made to my specifications.  My only complaint is that there was very little Secret Sauce  so much of the burger was dry  see photo   I will be back though  next time I ll just request extra Secret Sauce and see if that fixes the problem.
Jack in the Box,2,I got an Uber eats order. Y all gave me no ranch  no taco sauce and I asked for a coke and y all gave me coke cherry.  How do y all not give yalls costumers no sauces for their food.
Jack in the Box,3,Had ok experiences before here with only on other mishap on a wrong order on a busy night. Though tonight I m writing this bc I was shocked while waiting in line for 15 min already. Got to the speaker to order and was told directly that they were only taking Uber and DoorDash orders and they I could not place an order myself... wtf...
Jack in the Box,4,Usually the tacos are good from this location but they were not properly cooked this time. I got 4 of them and had to throw them all away. I ve never had bad tacos here until today.
Jack in the Box,5,I realize that for most  the fast food industry isn t ones dream job but stop treating customers like they are an inconvenience and annoyance to you.  My first job was at a Jack in the Box in West Covina and everything I learned about good customer service I learned from my four years there.    Tonight  just placing my order was daunting.  After each item I ordered I was cut off with a curt  Is that it  .  When ordering for a couple of people and being responded to like that  I really just wanted to leave.  Maybe try  What else can I get for you   Or  Would you care for some dessert with your order  .  Anything but  Is that it  .    When I pulled up to the window she repeated my order total and took my credit card  charged it and then handed it back to me without a word or even a thank you.  She then handed me my food she didn t look at me  say a word to me at all.  When I got home I looked in my bags and for a total of 4 tacos there were 18 packets of hotsauce but no ketchup for my fries.  How challenging can it be to ask which condiments I would like   18 packets is a waste and comes out of the stores bottom line.  Here s the deal  im a guest at your establishment and giving you money in exchange for goods.  With so many other restaurants in your immediate area kindness and appreciation might guarantee regular visits.  It ll be quite some time before I return to this location.  Do better.
Jack in the Box,6,They take about 1-2 hrs to take ur order and u have to wait for this kind of food . JUST NASTY if I could give it 0 starts I would of . Just nasty asf
Jack in the Box,7,I went to this location which is a 24hr drive through and the guy in the back told me they were closed. Clearly didn t wanna work since it was 24hrs and says 24hr drive through on the sign. I always come around this time but whoever works this shift shouldn t work if they don t wanna do their job
Jack in the Box,8,I should be able to leave negative stars....  I went through the drive thru and they gave me the food  which took 15 minutes  but ok. I drove home and realized they did not give me the drink  or soy sauce. So I drove back to get the drink  waited another 10 minutes in line  there was 1 car in front of me  and the guy at the window was totally befuddled as to what to do. He was young and probably just started  but come on  just give me the drink so I can get home. Then the girl who initially helped me came and was equally unhelpful  but not because she was young and inexperienced  but because she had no desire to make it right. What the hell  if you work in food service  you need to understand customer service  especially when YOU were the one that created the problem. By this time I pointed out that the food would be cold by the time I got home and was going to ask for a refund  which is totally reasonable after wasting all my time  being hostile and incompetent. I also said I wanted the receipt  which she never gave me  because I wanted to go online to leave them a review  and she declined. She said  with a snotty tone  where s the food   and I said I would go back and get it. I drove back and got it and drove back for a THIRD time  and there was a line of cars around the parking lot so I walked up to the window and asked the guy in the car if I could hand them the food and he just laughed and said  sure . The people  working  at the window said  where s the receipt      I reminded her I didn t have it because THEY never gave it to me. Then they just closed the window on me. So I got back in my car and drove to the drive thru. I got in the line at 1 38am. I got to the window at 2 02  More incompetence. The kid didn t know what to do  as the girl who messed the order just stood there in the background and watched  I finally waved her over and told her that there was the food. She did EVERYTHING to try avoiding making it right  including threatening to call the police because I wouldn t drive away after they took my money  gave me a partial order  wouldn t make it right  and wouldn t give me a refund. I told them to please call them  but they didn t. The kid leaned out the window and basically said it was messed up but he didn t know what to do  and the girl just continued to argue with me. When she finally realized that I wasn t leaving without the refund she gave it to me  told me I should have gotten the receipt  and checked the order  which may be true  but I pointed out she should have checked the order  it is her JOB  after all   and give me the receipt. She called me an idiot      Thats the short version  but welcome to jack in the box. Ill never go here again  and you probably shouldn t either but if you do  go through your food  and be sure you get a receipt. And if the mess up your order  just call your card and dispute the charge rather than wasting the time driving back and forth  and waiting in line  not even to mention the aggravation with the extraordinary incompetence and arrogance.
Jack in the Box,9,Some quality fast food. Zero complaints  great service and very tasty. The burgers are excellent.
Jack in the Box,10,Tacos are alot better here then any other jack in the box ive been to in the area very pleased with my order 
Jack in the Box,11,Look  i understand dealing with drunk people and being In the city but the drive thru lady was incredibly rude  We tried to order 10 tacos and were told  we only have 5 ... what kind of mess is that        And then when we asked for our total we were given 3 different numbers   Do not ever come here if you are hungry bc they are out of everything  ALSO  out food was extremely cold   
Jack in the Box,12,This was my first time in awhile buying from them  my friends and I went to go get some food pretty late because they were still open. I got the seasoned curly fries and from 2-11am I was throwing up. I have food poisoning now  I looked up if other people have got food poisoning and thousands of people around the US have had it. I don t recommend at all.
Jack in the Box,13,So one star for your hours and rude employees - The  a href   redir url http 3A 2F 2FJackinthebox.com amp s 0c114cb11026bddfe62c7572007833f634b356d27229cd9fd8d097ffabecc189  rel  nofollow  target  _blank  Jackinthebox.com  a  website lists this location as 24 hours  but every time  I go later at night now  I am greeted by a voice in the drive-thru that says  we re actually closed  or something to that effect . It doesn t matter if it is right after midnight or 3 in the morning. The very last time there was a handwritten sign saying it was closed  today  it was that boxed voice again - even though there was an employee sitting out front smoking and obviously another inside talking to me. Are you open are you closed or do you just pay people to stand around and smoke and tell customers you re closed  Food wise  when you re open or your employees want to work  it s ok  never much care for how it s put together  but I ve always liked JITB  that is until this location. Sad to have such a great location and be losing  so much late night business 
Jack in the Box,14,Not sure why I come to this place.  Maybe because it s by my house and I hope one day they re get their stuff together.  List of things they ve been out of   rice  chicken  egg rolls  root beer  Dr Pepper and there s a few I ve probably forgotten.  I m not sure how they stay in business when they re randomly out of things ALL the time.  Oh and one night they just  didn t have a cook  so there s that..
Jack in the Box,15,Poor service  poor attitude  slow service all around bad time. I get its fast food bit so is chick filet and you would never get service like this there...
Jack in the Box,16,Carlos the cook sucks....he is a pretend to be manager supervisor who wanted to show off in front of his female co-workers by refusing to take our coupons. He lied and said we can only use 1 coupon per car  when the coupon says we can use 1 coupon per person per visit  through our coupon back at us and told us to leave. The coupon worked in bringing us to this location but the poor attitude will sure cost you all more business.
Jack in the Box,17,PUBIC HAIR IN MY BURGER. Visited this location on 10 26 17 at 9 54 pm. I found a giant pubic hair cooked into the patty of my burger. I will never again visit any Jack In The Box. Absolutely disgusting  absolutely unacceptable. Accidents happen but I am not letting this one slide.
Jack in the Box,18,Nice new remodel. I like this location the best. Better food quality taste and location is great
Jack in the Box,19,So  I went through the drive thru and order my stuff. Got to the window and gave this person who did not seem to know what they were doing my credit card. They told me it declined which I knew was impossible  so I asked them to run it again. About two seconds later she handed it back to me and said it declined again even though I knew she did not really try to run it as the card was good. Told her to forget it. Went across the street to McDonalds. Got basically the same thing  but less expensive and low and behold my credit card worked just fine. A couple of days later the charge that would not supposedly go through at Jack in The Box showed up on my billing statement. Contacted their local office via email and they assured me that they would give me a refund. They also sent me a coupon for a free meal that expired two days after I received it. They never gave me a refund and I ended up having to charge my card back to get a refund. Bad customer service at every level 
Jack in the Box,20,We don t normally frequent chain restaurants  but this one  amp  one other are exceptions to that rule. We love the food  pure  amp  simple.   This location is pretty typical. Average customer service  average environment. But put that together with tasty food  a convenient location  and a great price... and you re left with a decent place to bring a large family to eat that won t break the bank.
Jack in the Box,21,I been there all my life  and worked there for a little while . Kelly is an amazing person i live him   he s always so amazing and so nice . Recently i just had a really bad experience  these new girls especially  Sandra  is so rude and disrespectful. I was being nice because I thought she was new and I been there before but she threw me the order and btw I ordered a float  it was just soda and whipped cream . Sandra was really rude   I tried calling and no answer . That really is upsetting.
Jack in the Box,22,Customer service isn t that great here  but I come ever so often because this is the closest place to me. What drew the last straw for me is that I walked in to place an order and asked if I can get a shake for a drink  the cashier shook her head and said no. Okay  that was fine  but someone came through drive thru and asked for a shake and she said  Let me check the machine real quick.  it worked and she said she could accommodate the shake. I witnessed all this and I proceeded to ask    Am I able to order a shake then   She told me no  she s only able to make one.  I asked her how she was able to sell it to drive thru  and she said there was only enough mix to make one and she could prove it to me. That was besides the point  I asked her how was she able to check the machine for drive thru  but yet she couldn t check it for me...    Note....she was a manager on shift and didn t care or felt bad for what she just did. HORRIBLE      Good example you are setting for your team.. 
Jack in the Box,23,I get sick EVERY time I have eaten here. Hadn t been in a while and gave it a chance due to the late hour. Same result. AVOID   
Jack in the Box,24,Hi  I just left Jack on Burnet Rd. And Anderson Ln.  I ordered 2 sour dough Jacks and one sauced carne asada with Curley fries and was charged 30 cents extra for the Curley fries  but when I got home it had reg. Fries   I guess next Time I will open my food containers before I leave Jack.  The food is still good   Carry out number 498 
Jack in the Box,25,This place is terrible. We were excited to cheat a little on our diet and have some fast food. Total waste of a cheat meal. Sourdough jack tasted off. My wife s Spicy Chicken sandwich was not good. Even the tacos and egg rolls tasted weird. The. Their fountain drink was broken and they could not give us our sodas and would not refund our money for the drinks because  a manager was not there to approve it . We won t be going back.
Jack in the Box,26,Dear Jack in the Box   You suck. My tummy is not happy with you at ALL. Learn to cook your food properly. Die now.  Thanks bunches   D.
Jack in the Box,27,This Jack-in-the-Box holds a special place in my heart.  The employees are friendly.  Like all Jack-in-the-Box locations  they are cheap and often have specials displayed in posters hung on their windows.  I ve never gotten sick eating here before.  It has a 24-hour drive-through window but the indoor-dining closes at midnight.  They have free refills  too  since the drink fountain is located next to the ordering counter .  This Jack-in-the-Box location is spotlessly clean  fast  and conveniently-located.  They have a driveway off Burnet Rd and another off Anderson Ln.  They are located on the Northeast corner of Burnet Rd   Anderson Ln.  For a fast food place  it definitely deserves five stars.
Jack in the Box,28,Sense a theme here on the service   I ve never had a problem with the staff not speaking English.  Now  I ve had the staff on their cellphones  both in the drive thru and the dining room.  And I ve had orders butchered on numerous occasions  even though I never ask for anything out of the ordinary.    But damnit the ultimate cheeseburger is awesome.  Just take the extra time to open your bag and make sure it s what it s supposed to be.  The jerks behind you in the drive thru can deal with it  and heck they ll probably do the same thing.
Jack in the Box,29,Accurate order-taking with correctly filled orders as well as the new seasoned burgers make for a four-star fast food dining experience.  It s not Uchi or Sullivan s  but it s good for.... fast food.  Besides  I have an addiction to Jack in the Box tacos and that awesome Freestyle drink machine.
Jack in the Box,30,every visit... every employee...everytime is slow  wrong and a ridiculous experience.  I know I know..it is at a busy intersection Burnet and Anderson..there  might be slim pickins for hirees at such a busy location.  Hells bells can English be the drive-thru persons..say 2 nd language  Ah well  when in the mood for  quick meal  and quicker digestion of that meal..you will for sure get one out of 2 here....grnted it will be the latter of them but..  ok as you were.
Jack in the Box,31,Jack in the Box...  How does one properly review a jack in the box  does one review it on its merits of food quality  or does one review it on its merits of service  or speed  or even just against other jack in the boxes one has been to..   I think I have been to a faster JitB  and I think I have been to an easier to get in and out of JitB.   This is the closest JitB I have ever lived near  and it also is the most recently remodeled JitB I have been too. It is very clean now after the remodel  but before  going in was bad.   It has the JitB odor  that others who live near JitB s will understand. Just before and during certain rush hours  the steam and smoke that billows out of the top smells like rancid YUK. That is unless you have had a few to drink  then it just drives you mad that you can not walk up to the drive through window.
Jack in the Box,32,Im a stranger to this part of town and was here on errands  and needed some breakfast for my kids because we were out earlier than usual. This place seems like an unseeming location  but the service was AMAZING. I didn t realize there were breakfast kids meals  So I began ordering little things separately like I usually do  and the lady realized I must be ordering for kids and recommended the kids meals. Saved me money  I ve never noticed it on a menu. Everyone at the register was all smiles and very friendly  And the food was fresh too. It was a pleasant way to begin my day  Thanks for the great service. When I m back in the area  I ll return 
Jack in the Box,33,This location has really gotten its act together. Every time I visited in the last few months I m greeted with friendly service and  the correct food.  Yeah- maybe someone reads Yelp 
Jack in the Box,34,Again  I stopped by and ordered a  Supreme Croissant  waited for near to 5 minutes. When I got back to the office it was a  Sausage Croissant  I was not going to waste my gas going back but I was very disappointed with the staff for making this error. Maria took the order  I do not know who made the sandwich. I don t go often because it is so far from my office so it is a treat that was a letdown.  Just thought you should know 
Jack in the Box,35,The Event   I was getting thirsty and a little hungry and saw the Jack in the Box on the corner.  I zipped in and ordered two cheeseburgers with special sauce instead of mustard and ketchup and a drink from the drive thru window.   I then drove around the back and parked to eat my goods.  You may think that was an event in itself but it wasn t the event.  As I was eating a small pickup truck pulled up in an open space just in front and to the side of the Batmobile and I noticed that a young couple was inside. The pickup was one that was modified so the cab was about three feet higher than the tires which made the pickup about four to five feet from the ground.  The passenger side of the pickup door opened and a really cute sexy Asian girl slid across the seat and jumped to the ground.  At that instant her sun dress caught on something in the seat and when her feet hit the ground her dress was up to her neck and almost over her head. Whoops there it is     Not a stitch of underwear top or below  DOH .  Well I am guessing my face was now three shades of red and my tongue was hanging out of my mouth and heading down my chin.  For what seemed like minutes but I am guessing less than five seconds she regained herself and pulled the dress loose and back in place.  She then noticed me and looked at me right in the eyes and smiled and politely walked around the pickup and took her guys hand and headed into the Jack in the Box.  Now I will have this image  The Event   in my mind for years to come.  I am guessing I was at the right place at the right time or was it the wrong place at the wrong time.  Only the reader can decide.  Anyway I finished by cheeseburgers and drink and drove away.  I like the cheeseburgers and have eating them many times over the years but only with the special sauce. I know this was a onetime event but I can always hope for a repeat.    Would I go back  Yes every now and then I crave a cheeseburger with the special sauce.  BTW  Did I mention I like the special sauce 
Jack in the Box,36,Honestly I m really sympathetic to fast food workers  but after finding hair in my food TWICE  the second time two hairs  I just stopped eating here. I haven t been able to eat at Jack in the Box since.
Jack in the Box,37,I think this is the right location i went to. The service was excellent and the employee was very nice.  I ordered the 2 tacos and a medium fries and drink the drink was great the fries were fare little cold but maybe that was because i got it togo but the tacos were not good. I had better tacos at other restaurants
Jack in the Box,38,Takes way too long to get your food here if you dine in. After the food  ordered 4 milkshakes and took 10 minutes for them to even get started on them. Eat somewhere else. Not worth coming here.
Jack in the Box,39,Am I really giving Jack in the Box 4 stars    Heck ya.  It is kind of scary that the staff has always been super friendly and smiles at you.  Hey Olivia staff  take note  My food is always hot and well delicious.  I love their cheeseburger...cheese is always melted perfectly and good meat to bread ratio and curly fries. Oh the curly fries.  I know it is not someplace to frequent  but I really relish in my precious time with Jack.
Jack in the Box,40,Early morning late nights on the weekend they routinely have only 1 person working. Last weekend from time I ordered to the time I got my good was 23 mins. These are very busy times and more than 1 person is necessary. Also  their window decals state that their entire menu is available all day  but they refuse to serve anything their late night meals during the day. Get your advertising right 
Margie'z Place,1,I had four Street tacos here while I was at Independence brewing. They were absolutely delicious and Margie was very sweet. The chicken and beef fajita meat was very lean and no gristle or fat and everything was well cooked and delicious. My wife got the nachos which was a really big serving and I had some of those which were also great. I will definitely be back here for the beer and for the tacos 
Margie'z Place,2,The best crispy beef tacos I ve eaten in Texas  Try it   The nachos are also delicious  
Margie'z Place,3,Awesome taco food truck at Independence Brewing Company.  I ordered the crispy chicken tacos and my wife had the al pastor street tacos.  Both styles were excellent 
Pio Pio Tacos,1,Best Tacos in Austin  My favorite is the Pork Tacos with the red sauce 
Pio Pio Tacos,2,Legit fresh and delicious Mexican food. I ve tried their mini tacos and Sopes and the Gorditas. This place is truly exceptional and the people that run the truck are so friendly. I love that they give a packet of sour cream with each order and their salsa s are on point   Give them a try  you will not be disappointed  
Pio Pio Tacos,3,A fabulous place to enjoy healthy Mexican food. I decided to take a chance and order a few things off Uber Eats for dinner tonight. The food arrived hot because they wrapped it in foil  so that was a huge plus. The flavor was excellent. Very fresh  healthy  and low salt   oil. You can tell that this is quality food made by people who care. I really hope their standards never change no matter how busy they may get. Thanks for becoming my new favorite mexican place.
Blue Gecko,1,Pricey but worth it. The tacos are huge. The dont skimp that s for sure. Very sad they moved.
Blue Gecko,2,Went here after me and my wife decided to try tacos while we were on vacation. The guy making the tacos didn t wear gloves or anything while making the food which I didn t like. The chicken tacos was stuffed pretty good with chicken but lacked seasoning and toppings. My wife had the pulled pork tacos and they were okay. For the price I would ve expected more
Blue Gecko,3,This place has fantastic tacos  The flavor is very authentic and reminds me of tacos I ve had in costal towns south of the border. The owner was really pleasant and they have a few nice tables to sit at outside. I will definitely be trying them again 
Blue Gecko,4,This place has the some of the best tacos ive ever had. The contents are seasoned and flavorful and they offer tacos you can t get anywhere else. great customer service and food always
Blue Gecko,5,Tacos here are amazing   Steak  Shrimp  Fish  Chicken pretty much everything   My whole family loves this place 
Blue Gecko,6,Ok so I been in Austin for About two years on this side of town I would have to travel to Rosita Al Pastor bomb tacos I can finally say the Tacos here were amazing the bang bang shrimp Tacos and the Texas taco I also had a salmon taco all 3 get a 5 star from. This shit was real good and also great customer service. I met the owners one day in HEB they invited me to try took me A while glad I did this is great and definitely will be back and by the way the taco are huge.
Blue Gecko,7,Why only one star.  Never had the opportunity to taste their food.  Tried to order through delivery  through their offering of Grub Hub .  Second attempt At 5 00 PM they actually gave me updates    My order is being prepared  then  It is on it s way  - 2hours later  I was starving  and they said they would refund my money because the restaurant had closed .  By the way the place is just down the road form me.  Tried again today and the phone number I got was Grub Hub.  No-one spoke English and after 15 min. I give up. Oh yes  tried calling the restaurant directly and they kept asking  new order  and when I went to relate my past 3 experiences  they hung up.  By I am retired  love to cook but like to order out once a week for things I do not want to cook .  Why can I not post this without giving all my information 
Blue Gecko,8,I did not receive one of my tacos and they are expensive.  5 for a beef or chicken and  7 for seafood. I tried calling and emailing with no response. I gave a tip before receiving my food and my order was around  32 for just 2 tacos and nachos.  I will say it is a big portion for the nachos and they were tasty. My father enjoyed the pork taco  but did not like the fish which I gave him since the 3rd taco was missing.
Blue Gecko,9,Really wanted to like this place... but I couldn t. There s just no flavor. At first I was shocked because the tacos range  7- 9 EACH but then I saw the size and could understand why. Pretty good size taco. But again  the flavor... there s none. I added the salsa and it s not spicy or flavorful. Customer service was 10 10. Overall  it was just good. I m a native Austinite and have had similar tacos for a quarter of the price with lots of flavor. Maybe if there was a spicer sauce or more seasoning it could be better.
Blue Gecko,10,Very underwhelming and expensive for bad food. 4 tacos and queso    50. Nothing was homemade. The salsa had 0 flavor and the queso was definitely just heated up from a can. I had the beef taco and the bang bang shrimp. The beef taco was the most greasy taco I ve ever had with 0 flavor. I ve never see so much shredded cheese just dumped on top. The taco shell was chewy and not crunchy. The bang bang shrimp. What a nightmare. The shell was a tempura shell  It was so massive you couldn t even eat it. They serve it with a fork. 3 ok tasting shrimp with a flavorless slaw on the bottom. They have a  bar  attached that you can t go into. It s just there to house the beer for when patrons order. Definitely would not recommend and won t be going back.
Blue Gecko,11,The food here was absolutely delicious. The seating area and overall setup was nice too. We ordered from the food truck and sat outside on the bar s patio and enjoyed the breeze while we feasted on the Adobe Chicken and Baja Shrimp tacos as well as their homemade salsa with chips. The chicken was street style on double corn tortillas. It was juicy  marinated shredded chicken that had a bit of a kick...which I LOVE. The Baja Shrimp was in the puffy taco shell. My husband really loved them. The salsa was good  but could have used a little salt.  That s our preference which is easy enough to add. Others may think it s perfect as is.  They have several choices for drinks at the truck like canned sodas  bottled water  Topo Chico  Corona Beer and White Claws. If you wanted a margarita or other specialty drink you could find them at the bar. I would definitely go here again. There were plenty of seating options  fans  fun outdoor lighting  speakers for music and other food truck options. I definitely see us making this a local hangout.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,1,Not sure why the reviews are so low. I mean it is a Chipotle  so you shouldn t be expecting high end cuisine. I got a bowl and I thought it was on par with other Chipotles I ve been to. Pretty good quality.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,2,I paid cash and the cashier acted as if she didn t have to give me my change back. Like this was normal. Then when I asked about the change she owed me she said that they didn t have change to give me. This is the second time this has happened at this location. Not sure where chipotle gets off taking my lunch money but that register needs to be stocked if the store is open.  
Chipotle Mexican Grill,3,This Chipotle is walking distance from my house and I ve come here over 100 times. It was good for a while but then got a new manager and it has been downhill ever since.  Now it feels like they are constantly bringing in new people to try to get this location firing on all cylinders but it s just gotten worse.   I have gotten to the point where I know my order will be wrong or laughable portions based on who is there.   Check out the photo below of my  salad . Look at these portion sizes . I think I counted 9 total pieces of lettuce.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,4,Terrible burrito. Like  the worst. Every ingredient tasted gross and I ended up throwing away a  40  after delivery tip and taxes  meal. Proportions were wrong and the ingredients tasted... off. Just gross.  Now I m mad at myself for ordering it. Never again.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,5,Ok so just to let it be known  this was the absolute last straw with this chipotle on 5th. Mind you  I live in the building so I gave them more than enough chances to redeem themselves  ofc to only be let down again. To start off I asked for double tortilla shell  for extra coverage due to me requesting double meat  the employee proceeded to wrap it normal without spreading them out  all the while  my burrito is crying for help due to being double meat  yet the employee proceeded to wrap the burrito as it burst out completely from the shell. Attitude out of This world  you d think someone getting ready to get off would be extremely chipper  complete opposite. This chipotle continues to piss me off time after time  the saddest part is I still choose to give you my money  pathetic of me ofc.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,6,Taste good to me. I don t know what the fuck everyone else is bitching about. Lol Carnitas
Chipotle Mexican Grill,7,Hands down the best Chipotle in Austin. Always excellent service  amp  fresh ingredients. Keept up the good work guys.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,8,I go to Chipotle regularly and this is the branch closest to me. Finding street parking nearby is kind of a pain. I haven t experienced problems with small portion sizes like some of the other Yelpers. Guac is always fresh  which is a big plus for me.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,9,Do not order online to this location. The smallest portion I have ever seen for Chipolte   This is the first time I have used the online app and it was super convenient however  I was less than impressed with my order.  Very small portion and the guac did not look fresh.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,10,Simple  clean and wholly satisfying Mexican food.  I really enjoyed my dinner the two times I visited this place while in Austin for the week.  It s in a really nice  and newer development  area in the neighborhood. The burrito portions are HUGE and the ingredients fresh.  I enjoyed the Carnitas Burrito both times there.    It seems popular with the locals as I observed while dining in both nights.   The staff was friendly and they worked hard to keep the place clean when not taking care of customers.    However  I will suggest the self-serve drink station be cleaned up a little more frequently.  Other than that  I d be happy to recommend this restaurant.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,11,This is the best chipotle in Austin. Ignore the other reviews. Ive ordered more chipotle than anyone who has ever left a review on Yelp and I can tell you for a fact they have the freshest ingredients  best customer service  and correct portion sizes.  The chipotle on 6th Congress and the one by UT will give you a soggy wimpy burrito. But East 5th knows how to roll a burrito   Shame they stopped doing mobile orders though
Chipotle Mexican Grill,12,Live in the Saltillo apartment building above  have eaten here 20 plus times. New manager  has helped a bit but is still understaffed and sloppy.   The lack of customer service with greeting  slowness in getting food ready  and overall disarray that is apparent makes this chipotle specifically a pain to deal with.   Corporate should send one of their regional managers here for 3 months to train the staff correctly. This place should be packed and it s not because it s slow and unorganized.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,13,This location is poorly managed. Employees need better training. They are super slow  don t greet you  running all over the restaurant and not at an assigned station like other chipotles. Food station didn t look clean. Will go out of my way to another chipotle location rather than this one unless there s improvement.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,14,Love the food and how easy it is to order online. I m writing this review to hopefully change how little chips they give you. Here s a photo of my chip bag. This happens every time. It drives me crazy. It s like they expect you to have more chips at home for the queso   
Chipotle Mexican Grill,15,Some of the worst customer experience I ve encountered. We waited to be helped for at least 5 minutes while no body else was in line. Cashier had an attitude and was so rude. One of our bowls was half empty and on top of that we found a HUGE CLUMP OF HAIR in it. 0 10 experience  we will not be coming back.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,16,Just opened  Always an easy  go-to fast food choice for me. Relatively healthy with wholesome ingredients. I always opt for double everything  cilantro lime rice  black beans  mild salsa Pico de gallo  fajita veggies and  corn. I normally go for their chipotle marinated chicken. It s tender  juicy and packed with a smoky flavor    To avoid long lunch lines  order by phone  online  or though the app  Walk straight up to the register when it s ready.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,17,Same great high quality food. Quick service. They added cauliflower rice which is a must try.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,18,As a step above fast food chain restaurant you would think that the experience level would be fairly similar across the board... wrong. This location is new and probably the  nicest  one near downtown Austin so why is the service absolute garbage every time I come here  The cleaning and food preparation standards are wildly low and the staff is blatantly rude and overall unprofessional. When I requested that the food preparer changed his gloves after he was cleaning the counter with a soppy  wet  rag and changing out the trash he pulled off his mask and started talking about me to his co-workers saying i m find bro i m so done. It was really off putting and made me feel so uncomfortable. After his co-workers and him started making fun of my order under their breath I had to pull a Karen and just leave. i have stopped ordering here off uber eats because the order is almost never correct and always sloppy and or sparse. I would urge the management here to better train their staff on customer etiquette as well as heath code compliance. Sad to say but after a number of bad experiences I will no longer be eating at this establishment.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,19,Went to pickup my food after ordering and paying online. I had a promise time of  7 30pm  and my order wasn t ready until 8 05pm. A full hour after it was placed. Very few people were in line during this time. Not enough to be over 30 minutes late while still actively serving people at the counter.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,20,We go out of our way to use this location rather than the one that is closer to us because they are generally pretty timely and nice. Would recommend    I usually get the veggie bowl  which includes guac  and they sometimes forget the guac  which is super annoying to discover when you get home     but are otherwise fairly reliable with online orders.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,21,Honestly this location is awful. Some of the employees seem to have a chip on their shoulder. One of the female employees in the front puts the bare minimum of food in your bowl  and when you ask for more she has an annoyed look and body language. If I m paying  2 extra for cauliflower rice I expect a full spoon full of it. I recently walked into the location 03 25 21 for lunch and there s was only 1 person in front of me who also walked in at the same time. There was 1 girl in the front making something  and another girl in the back who started walking toward the register rolling her eyes and throwing her head back. Then they both went to the back of the store leaving me and the other customer confused and by alone waiting. I continued to hear an angry slamming of things around in the back before they finally came back out to help their customers. I work in retail and this attitude and behavior is completely unacceptable  if I acted like this where I work I would be disciplined and possibly fired for it. One of the worst things you can do in any job is treat your customers like you don t want them to be there. These ladies act like they don t want to be there and it really shows in their customer service skills  which they have ZERO of by the way. This is disappointing because I like chipotles food but unfortunately I won t be going to this location anymore. Please clean up your employees attitudes or hire new people.
Jack in the Box,1,Not the happiest friendliest bunch here. Also check your food before you drive off. This passed as a large fry.
Jack in the Box,2,Bad food     I agree with commenter Johnathan L.     Check your food before you leave or you will end up with very old food  like me   My worst experience with this place   Check out my tacos. You decide.  The drive through employee didn t seem unhappy but my food made me unhappy 
Jack in the Box,3,Usually have a decent experience coming to this location. Not this morning. Ordered several things...cashier seemed to be in a bad mood. She took my credit card for payment and returned it with no receipt  I usually get one . The food looked like they grabbed yesterdays left overs and tried to make me a sandwich  supreme croissant . Cold cheese  crumbled bacon  greasy egg.  -   Very disappointing.  Whoever prepared this meal should not be In a kitchen. Very bad experience.
Jack in the Box,4,Worst Jack in the box ever. They need a new manager.  I just attempted to go through the drive-thru and was informed they have not meat.
Jack in the Box,5,I ve never had any luck with Jack in the Box  except for one nice milkshake  but this one failed hard in breakfast. I mean a rock hard biscuit for the sandwich.  The hash brown wasn t bad.  Also.  You can t get decaf coffee here  so I won t be back.
Jack in the Box,6,For many years  I occasionally would hit the drive thru at a Jack in the Box because I usually could get a chicken fajita pita that was somewhat decent for being fast food. The one I got at this location was the worst I can remember ever having. The chicken was so grey and slimy that I couldn t eat it. I m guessing it was bad luck  but now I m hesitant to take the chance at ordering another one from this William Cannon location.
Jack in the Box,7,This location closes whenever it wants. I made a large order on the app at 10 20p on a Saturday only to show up and they had already closed even though they processed my payment and they are listed as open late.
Jack in the Box,8,They re never open. Like ever. There are employees inside but they won t take your order. We ve been told they re out of food  they re experiencing technical issues or their systems are down. I live close so I have no choice when I m craving those mini tacos and they seem to drop the ball every time
Jack in the Box,9,I have no idea why I am even here after the last time.  Does Jack in the box corporate even care how terrible they are  Done for good 
Jack in the Box,10,Drive thru took like 20 minutes  very simple order and they still screwed it up. By the time I realized it couldn t go back to complain  the whole place was locked up. They must have very inexperienced staff.
Jack in the Box,11,First time visit  drive-thru  and staff was friendly. Food was served promptly and exactly how we ordered. I was a tad disappointed with the chicken sandwich - way too bland but the next day hubby went back and we tried the burgers  which are pretty good. Doable if you re super hungry and need a quick fix.
Jack in the Box,12,I went to this jack in the box this Wednesday about 745pm. I found the east door not operating and would not open. I then walked to the lobby door facing empty cannon and walked into an empty lobby. I walked up to the counter and observed several people in the cooking area cooking and taking care of the drive through. I made eye contact with the female in the back but she continued cooking and ignored me. I waited about 10 minutes and left. This is the worst treatment I have ever received from a restaurant in along time. If jack in the box cannot do better than this Close Down. Sorry experience and go anywhere but this restaurant.  Bad place. I ll never be back.
Jack in the Box,13,Sign says the drive thru is open 24 hrs but at least 4 times they have turned off all the lights and pretended to be closed. There have literally been handwritten signs from the SAME employee saying they are closed for the night  I know from the car parked in the parking lot literally every single time  and don t respond to cars who come through the drive thru. Horrible customer service.   This is now the probably 5th time I ve come that they ve pretended to be closed... absolutely ridiculous.
Jack in the Box,14,Drive through person is amazingly rude and crazy   Just went through and woman was barking out at me.  She was aggressive  and this isn t the first time she s done this.  She doesn t want to add in options or allow you to change your mind.  She basically screams through the microphone.  If I was her boss  I would fire her on the spot for aggressive behavior toward customers.
Jack in the Box,15,Came to eat and saw a lady in the kitchen texting on her phone and than pick up cheese to finish making a hamburger. I was standing at the counter and asked the employees who the manager was and the person who was on her phone turned out to be the manager.  Look  this is gross and I will never visit this place again.
Jack in the Box,16,I went there at 10pm on a Saturday. It was only 5 after 10  they close at 11pm. They were not open. That is unacceptable. Sorry I get off late and wanted some garbage food.
Jack in the Box,17,I have come to this location a couple times in the am  i work late.. again I pulled to the drive through 230am on June 23. The lady said the card machine isn t working  this happened before here. The first time they said it didn t work and I fussed about it. They magically had it working after a couple mins. The thing is I know it s a late night shift  money is tight but claiming the card machine is broken just to have a cash exchange.... hummmmm so the owner of this spot should maybe check late shift inventory. This morning I told them I have three dollars then they said thank you and didn t even take my order when I said I would use cash.
Jack in the Box,18,On my recent visit to my neighborhood restaurant  I ordered double scrambled eggs  which I received  double bacon which by the way I received four slices on my previous visits. However  on this visit  I received two slices and was told by the cashier and manager that was a double order  because the slices were cut in half  It is my understanding that a double order would be four whole slices and not two slices  That s the reason for the low rating.
Jack in the Box,19,I have to drop the rating down to 2 stars this year as on several occasions when I would go in for a malt to take home to the Lady and freeze to eat later  works well and she likes it  and the malt machine was either not working or empty. This location is the only JITB I will eat at when I am dealing with an urgent matter and need food fast. I will say that they were a lifesaver in the past when I would come home in the middle of the night and had to have something before getting up in 2 hours to go deal with urgent matters.
Jack in the Box,20,Super friendly staff in the morning when I got breakfast at 6am-ish on a Thursday. Only a few cars in drive thru at that time. I ve been to this location twice. I don t eat out much at all fast food wise  but I d recommend this place. The only concern is the coffee isn t the greatest even with cream and sugar.
Jack in the Box,21,Hey the food is the food but the guy at the window was very concerned about customer service and was super nice so for this place definitely nice staff or whoever the guy at the window was
Jack in the Box,22,Not sure why the quality deteriorated so much. Spicy chicken sandwich was super dry and the bun was borderline stale. Not sure if this is store specific or across the franchise. They need to get their act together 
Jack in the Box,23,Countless times have I been to this restaurant. Countless times they have been unable to serve me.  This is arguably this most improperly managed restaurant in ALL OF AUSTIN.  Short staffed  poor shift changes  lights are on but they re not home.  EVER    You re lucky if they act like they re open after 10pm.  They mostly don t.  Seems like whomever is on shift is clearly also on drugs.  This restaurant just plain sucks at what they do.  Corporate JitB should revoke their franchise license. It s an embarrassment to a spokesman that wears a ping pong ball for a head.  Owners should sell and get out of the service industry permanently.  DO NOT ATTEMPT TO EAT HERE unless you are a glutton for punishment.  written as im.parked in the drive thru lane getting zero help from staff
Jack in the Box,24,Poor customer service  night staff 4 18 need to be put on corrective action and retrained.  Drive thru was open however staff were standing in the dining area talking and messing around while cars were in line waiting to order food 
Jack in the Box,25,The girl that took my order in the drive-thru repeatedly got my order wrong after rushing me to complete my order and the guy that brought the order to the car  who had shoulder length black or brown hair  was so rude. I said  excuse me  to ask for some dressing and he proceeded to walk away and when I said  excuse me  again he said  what  and rolled his eyes. I told him  there was no dressing in my bag for my salad  and he said  come inside I ll get it for you.  Every staff member involved in my order was unnecessarily rude and the chicken in my salad was old and cold. If I could give a negative rating I would. This was August 28th  2020 at around 9 15 pm.
Jack in the Box,26,I asked for a moment to confirm what we were getting as well as sides and drinks. When I started my order the employee snapped at me one second with attitude. I started ordering once she was ready and she rang up a combo 10 and I told her not the 10  2 number 13s. We finally were done and provided the balance of  22 and change.  Once we got to the window my friend asked to change the root beer to a Cherry Sprite and Sonya stated that was fine. She handed us the drinks which were 3 4ths of the way full. The Cherry Dr. Pepper was flat and we were provided a sprint. I pulled forward since there was a line behind me when my friend stated we should have checked the bag before moving. Once we checked the bag we realized we were missing the 2 tacos.  We called into the store on both her phone and my own at the number  512-899-1312. On my third call Sonia answered the phone and said come to the window at 12 52 am. I was agitated at this point and stated  No  this is a 45 min wait to be here  have someone bring them to the door  as my friend stood knocking at the door facing the employees. They just pointed to the window. At this point I walked back over to the window and called again. I physically saw Sonia go to the back and pick up the phone for my call at 12 57 am. I said Hello 2 to 3 times and she hung up and walked back to the line area near the drive through window. From here I got further impatient  called another 4 times and was ignored  as my friend was knocking and ignored.   Once we got back through the line to the window I told Sonya I wanted a refund as she tried to ask what was going on and what we needed. I asked her if she was the manager in which she responded she was. My friend ate her chicken strips and some fries  but at this point I no longer wanted the food after all of this and to just refund me the money. She stated she wouldn t then kept stating what do we need. I told her she can pull her times for the past hour  she was at 30 to 45 minutes before her orders were actually completed. I asked for the name of the general manager and when she would be in. She told me 9 am and Maria. At this point she called the other woman that was working over to translate as she kept saying no  i don t care. She told the other lady she didn t know what I wanted. I repeated to the other lady the same situation and how obviously they know there is a pendimic going on since they had face masks on so why would they think telling someone to WALK up to the window in a foot space was appropiate not to mention it had been 2 hours at this point for Jack in the Box. I wanted the name of the general manager and a contact number for corporate.   The woman that was making the food translated and Sonya stated she was corporate she is manager. She stated to the other woman in spanish. Fine if she gives back the food and both beverages she can have the money back. I repeated I can give you 1 of the orders and the drinks  but due to her nature of saying  I don t care  I needed to see her getting the cash before I started handing things to her. I handed the second woman the receipt. I had handed her the bag of food and one soda. She opened the food and started slamming it down on the window saying it wasn t all there and started pushing it back in my direction. I took the second cup and slamed it on the window and stated no  I want a refund. She grabbed  11 and change and gave it back to me. Throughout this interaction she kept telling me I don t care.   I asked for my receipt back and she told me no. Have a good day and I told her I wasn t leaving until I got my receipt. She slammed the door shut in my face and when I parked the car and told her I wasn t leaving without my receipt she started talking to the other girl about us still being there in which the other woman responded Oh my god and a few other words I couldn t hear and she came to the window. Sonya then instructed her to call the cops in which I stated that is fine. She opened the door and was being extremly condisinding at this point. She just grabbed the receipt and took pictures while she basically just held it out the window. I called her a pinche pendeja  fucking idiot  and she leaned out the window before releasing the receipt and said pinche tu madre  fuck your mom .    I tried calling the store Sunday from 2 20 pm to 2 40 pm. Got dressed and drove back to the store location as the GM was suppose to be there at 9 am. When I got there I pulled around and asked to speak with the GM. Another manager came to the window and I saw her name tag and asked if she was a manager  se said yes. I asked for the GM a second time and was advised she is not in. I told her a general breakdown of my prior night with Sonya and asked for a time the GM would be in because I am far from letting this go. I was informed that information is unable to be provided as well as Sonya is in fact NOT a manager. I tried calling once again Sunday evening and didn t get any answer.
Jack in the Box,27,Just came to jack in the box on my lunch break. After ordering at the window I pulled forward to wait for the rest of my order and as I was pulling forward I hear the lady that took my payment  Maria  call me a  bitch       Like what        You asked me to pull forward but then I m the bitch   So rude  P.s. Tatiana offers amazing customer service every time I go . Jack in the box hire more tatianas   The Maria s will make you loose business   
Jack in the Box,28,Gave one star because couldn t give zero stars. Went to this location at 5 30 pm waited in the drive thru line for 15 min. When my order was being taken I informed the cashier through the drive through speaker that I could barely hear him. Then nothing no hold a min  just nothing  so for 3 min I sat listening to nothing with part  most of my order on the screen. So in the confusion and haste   because two cars drove past ME giving me dirty looks  I drove up to the window. At which time the teen cashier says oh I went to get a new headset. I stated  ok  well let me finish my order. He says  oh sorry  my co-worker erased your order and I m not allowed to take an order at the window. So can you just drive back around to place your order at the screen. Or you can come in and have your order taken.   So at this point I state   ok well now I want to see your manager because that is crazy.  He tells me oh there is no manager in duty. Only a team leader I say  ok well let me speak to her.   After a few min he says oh she s on the grill. Can t you just come in. I state for the second time   my two year old is with me i can t possibly. Now I m beyond upset I take a picture of phone numbers to call to complain one is the store number and one is the survey number which only allows you to say what you think of your order taken. I then pull into a space to go in to complain asking for a corporate number. While I stand there and they approach me as if they have never seen me I talk to a customer there and tell her my issues. She laughs and says well good luck I ve been here for a about 10 Min and no one has even taken my order yet. When all three employees approach NOT ONE employee knew of such a number. Oh and by the by NOT ONE EMPLOYEE spoke English except the teen cashier.  another customer walks in turns out he too is coming from the drive thrust while listening to my exchange he leaves and states well that explains   I ask when is a manager going to be on duty. I m told NEXT WEEK. I ask how is that possible who will be doing your deposits  or tallies  and closing and opening the main store. The teen says well the manager is on vacation. I ask ok what about store managers  shift mangers. You have non of those. He tells me no. WHAT      Two weeks later still no manager on dusty no matter the time you return to the store
Jack in the Box,29,Visited the drive through of this location at least 8 times in the past 6 months. There is a surly young man with long dark hair working the drive through that  putting it a nice way  wouldn t know friendly customer service from his elbow. Just last week after seeing the ads for Jumbo Jacks we decided to order three combination dinners. The first problem was they were  out of drinks  and he wouldn t honor the  5.99 combo price even though I told him we d do without the drinks. Not only did he charge me full price for the three sandwiches and separate for the three  medium  fries for a total of  29.81  he said that they were out of the regular buns and I would need to pay a surcharge of  0.80 each for sourdough or  1.00 each for premium buns  we chose the latter.   When we arrived home two of the three sandwiches looked like they d sat under heat lamps for at least an hour or so...dried cheese and meat that was nearly inedible.   I took photos with my phone but couldn t post them here.  This will be the last time that we will visit this location until they replace this employee  offer fresher food and direct employees to be fairer with their pricing and offerings.  STAY AWAY 
Jack in the Box,30,45min wait. Only one person staffed. They take one order  go make it  then take the second order  repeat.  She was on the phone with someone joking and laughing the entire time.  Lady s name was Sonia  what..what is going on at this place  
Jack in the Box,31,I have been a loyal customer for over 15 years  going by the drive-in on my way to work for their breakfast sandwiches.  They have recent employee turnover  but  this is the fast food business.  Today I ordered a breakfast crossiant sandwich at the drive through  gave the drive through employee cash.  The cost of the sandwich was  4.54  I gave  20.54  the employee handed me the bag and did not give me the  16.00 owed  I drove off and realized an hour later they store owed me money.  No problem right   Wrong  when I looked for the receipt in the sandwich bag there was none.  When I went back the employee said he had no record of the receipt and did not owe me  16.00.  This is a scam.  There is a good chance other patrons  drove off without receiving their change  and this employee is probably ripping off the customer and Jack in the Box. This is a sad sign of the times  when an employee steals from their employer and the customer.  I will never return to this location.  Beware  do not pay in cash  
Jack in the Box,32,i pulled up into the drive thru at 11 15 pm to order a milkshake and there was no one inside to even take my order. i sat waiting by the window for 15 minutes waiting for someone to come back but no one did.  i just wanted a milkshake  very disappointed.
Jack in the Box,33,Food is good for fast food and being open 24 hours but always check your order. The accuracy here if you use the drive-thru is not good. Always check everything--taste your drink  check to make sure everything in your order is there before you drive away. They get orders right 1 5 visits.
Jack in the Box,34,Yeah  you re not open 24 hours if I pull up to the drive-thru at 10 35pm and no one responds and then the screen shuts off. Looked pretty empty inside the kitchen to me.
Jack in the Box,35,The service was terrible  The food was terrible  Not worth my time or money. The jalape os were so burnt you can t eat them  the  spicy chicken sand was NOT spicy and the chicken was chewy and hard  and out of strawberry shakes... waste of money and I d like a refund
Jack in the Box,36,I ordered tacos and when I got home they were drenched in oil I couldn t even it the tacos so disgusting I can t believe they serve food like this it s so lazy
Jack in the Box,37,The drive through at night need more people. There s one to two people every night and I ve been waiting in the line for about 10-15 min now just to get to window. It is 09 05 17 10pm and this is terrible They need to rethink how many people work at night
Jack in the Box,38,Just got back from going through the drive-through and I ordered the   8 which is a sriracha burger. Instead I got a spicy chicken sandwich   10. The fries were lukewarm  got no napkins or ketchup. The service was not very friendly. Do not recommend this location
Jack in the Box,39,Thought I d try a jack in the box burger. Sign said open til midnight  drive through open 24 hours. The doors were locked and no one was at the drive through. Why  Because they were outside leaning into a car chatting. I hope these people don t get paid much. I also hope the owner fires the night manager and crew. The owner should be embarrassed. I will never think of stopping at a jerk in the box again.
Jack in the Box,40,Stopped off here couple days ago in the morning on the way to work.  Wasn t impressed.  Lady in the drive thru seemed to be wanting to rush the orders.  I was one of two cars in the drive thru.   Didn t repeat my order back just said 2nd window please.  Then when I got my order.. It wasn t what I ordered.  Fast food isn t hard to get right.. I will not be returning to this location.
Jack in the Box,41,I almost got slapped when I asked the girl at the drive through if she could show me her Brazilian.  OK  so I didn t quite make the cut for the A-list at Estancia tonight  but I was very happy as usual to find that a little clown with the shakes did just fine as a B-plan.  Thanks  Jack 
Jack in the Box,42,This is a real tragedy.  The food  especially breakfast  is very good  the prices right  a good ad campaign  and 24 hour drive through.  I drove 20 minutes to have breakfast here at 8 30 on a Sunday morning.  Despite signs saying the dining room opens at 5AM  all the doors were locked.  I banged on the door until someone let me in.  The people working there were nice but short-handed  working as fast as they could just to handle the drive-through  indicating bad management and ownership.  The Freestyle machine was out of Coca-Cola. It looks like someone named Rucker is the culprit.  In the last 20 minutes  7 other eager customers have given up trying to get in.  The  50 in lost revenue could have covered more staff.  It is hard for the company to succeed when they have losers as franchisees  as this impacts their well-run stores.  Customers have many other choices 
Jack in the Box,43,Incompetent employees and food is not always fresh. I d think twice before eating here and if you go in the drive thru MAKE SURE TO CHECK YOUR FOOD before you drive off.
Jack in the Box,44,The food is always good but the lady that took my order in the drive thru was very short and rude and to top it off their inspection is out of date... believe it said 8 15 19 and today s the 22nd...
Jack in the Box,45,I know  I know  it s fast food   But I have been a fan of Jack In The Box for a long time.  On Friday  4 19 2019   we picked up some food to go for lunch and I was in the mood for a burger.  I chose the Buttery Jack Mushroom Swiss.  Big mistake.  Big  big mistake.  That patty tasted like it was made yesterday and thrown in the microwave.  Even the bread was stale.  The only reason I didn t give one star is that the fries were good.  Also  my sister ordered something completely different and we got the exact same order.  Ugh   This is probably the worst Jack in The Box I ve been to.
Jack in the Box,46,I love there chicken sandwich it s my go to when I stop here. It s almost as good as Chick-fil-A but it s cheaper than Chick-fil-A and open all night and Sundays so you can always get one.
Jack in the Box,47,I ve gone several times to order food and there was not a person who attended me to take my order is there for 10 or more minutes really I am very desepcionada  it is supposed to be open 24 hours
Jack in the Box,48,Curiosity doesn t always kill the cat. This time  it fed it.  I recently discovered the Deli Trio  and my taste buds have been thanking me for it ever since. Tonight the grilled sandwich tasted ten times better than usual. Provolone cheese melted and oozed from the slices of Artisan bread  drenched in creamy Italian dressing. Crunchy pickle spears protruded beneath the layers of Genoa salami  ham  and turkey  and I washed all of it down with the smooth-as-silk of Vanilla Coke.  Being open-minded has never tasted so good 
Jack in the Box,49,Lately the taco have been cold.  Need to file a compliant but been busy.
Jack in the Box,50,I have to have 2 greasy tacos every once and a while  but tonight after I finished at Walgreens  I started driving next door  and suddenly all the outside lights were turned out. Drove up by the window anyway  but the place was empty.  Thought it was open 24 hours - very weird...
Jack in the Box,51,Wow  Holy jeebus   They sell me tacos and then after they hand them to them to me say  oh sorry no taco sauce  and then we go to get drinks and they have no ice.  Then they say  oh sorry no medium lids  and THEN leave my son standing there for five minutes to get ketchup.  Top it off with the place being FILTHY.  GROSS.    UPDATE 10 28 18  Ok let me first say that I realize that updating a review for Jack in the Box might indicate that I had a little too much time on my hands  and I ll own that up front. In the interest of fairness  I feel like I need to talk about my most recent experience a few minutes ago. All you Austin locals will feel my pain here  but recent flooding prompted a boil notice and so most restaurants are either closed or handing you lukewarm bottled water. Well the boil notice was lifted so naturally I though asking for a nice icy Dr Pepper was reasonable.  So when the little girl asked me if she could put it over ice for me  I have to admit I felt a little pampered. Then out came my breakfast croissant  lLet me also admit that I rarely eat fast food  but I was desperate today  no offense Jack-in-the-Box.  and it was cheesy sausage egg perfection.  It was so fresh steam is coming off the side of it and cheese was melted down the other side. I m telling you  it was a winner. Thanks Jack-in-the-Box.
Jack in the Box,52,Nothing but bad experiences at this location. Hairs in the food  rude employees  missing food  etc. Every time it s something. I never write negative reviews  but this is too common of a theme. I m done with hoping this place will improve.
Jack in the Box,53,I get off work really late  like one or two in the morning and this is the only place open. They always get my order right and the food is great.
Jack in the Box,54,As I said before I m not a fan of greasy food. My husband loves this place  why I don t know. My stomach starts hurting when were in the vicinity of this place because of the smell of dirty Grease.
Jack in the Box,55,Third strike   Going through drive thru   4 45-5 00AM isn t my ideal  but I expect what I pay for.  I order SWEET tea with every order  and this is the 3rd time it s not sweet enough and OLD   Tea gets old and the container should be drained of any OLD tea and then brew a new batch.  Please instruct employees  OLD TEA SUCKS 
Jack in the Box,56,I like their Jumbo Jack  bowls and tacos. I like the grilled hamburgers and the good sauces on the tacos. I like their curly fries.
Jack in the Box,57,I would just like to take this opportunity to thank Jack for all the simple pleasures he has offered throughout my life.  My first fast food.   I was only a wee lass who was very excited that we were talking to a big scary clown and asking him for burgers with extra  secret sauce  from the seats of my sister s cool 67 Ford Falcon.  I shall cherish that memory.  Then came my teen-age years  where a super taco and a hot lemon turnover was pretty much the perfect munchie food for the wee hours of the night  where you really didn t know where the hell you were  but you were REALLY hungry and Jack was a familiar face with whom  you wanted to spend some time discussing a few important matters concerning the nature of the universe and perpetual motion.   Then came college and grad school  where your two tacos for .99 became life savers.  This is  apparently  what the financial aid people think you should live on  along with top ramen.  Oh Jack  thank you for those 99 cent tacos and keeping me alive.  Then came my adult years of realizing I needed to be healthy.  I realized I could still go through the drive-thru after going to the gym and get a chicken fajita pita  without cheese and a diet coke --ALL for under 250 calories    Just for old times sake  I stopped in for those 99 cent tacos the other day.  They were wonderful.  Same scary mystery meat  same weirdly appealing taco sauce  lots less cheese food.  Still tasty.   Still filling.  Still 99 cents.  Can t beat that.  postscript -- I forgot to add that I read about Jack in Fast Food Nation.  They once had an  unfortunate e coli incident .  But after that  they took extra special care and according to the book  they are one of the safest and better run fast foods around.  I knew I loved Jack.
Jack in the Box,58,I have been a customer for a while.  Today  I went through the drive thru and they forgot to put the tacos in my order.  I did not discover this until I was back to work and could not go back immediately and I threw the receipt in the drive thru trash.  After work  when I went in the drive thru and told them what happened  a young man s voice said  Sorry  there is nothing that I can do .  Well  if that is your policy  my policy when I am stolen from is to never go back and warn everyone else.  Now to write a weighted letter to management and be sure to  CC  all involved as well as The Better Business Bureau of Austin.  This is the first restaurant that didn t make good on their mistake. Ya ll just stole from the wrong person 
Jack in the Box,59,No stars would be more true to my experience tonight. I got boxed in at the drive thru for 20 minutes     I m sure that guy ahead of me had fresh warm food but mine was cold in a bag when I came up behind him and the ice in my drink had melted. I even commented that how could MY food be as warm  amp  fresh as that guy ahead of me when I see it all already sitting there in a bag  I was assured it just came out.  Yea don t think so. Fries sucked and that s the indicator for me. I wish they hadn t closed the Jack on Brodie
Jack in the Box,60,Just went to Jack and the Box and my food was hot and its 15 til 3 am. The food is always hot too. Their drive-thru staff is always cheerful and ready to serve  best fast food service in the area on a consistent basis. Well done.
Jack in the Box,61,I love this place.  I remember when they built it my wife and I were so excited  because we live within walking distance.  Our favorite thing to do is to walk there for lunch whenever there is an ice storm and the city shuts down.  They ve always been open.  You get a lot of food for the money  compare JITB to the Burger Tex across the street and you ll see what I mean   and the quality is overall pretty good.  No complaints... they used to have problems a few years ago where I didn t always receive everything I ordered in the drive-through  but they seemed to have worked it out.
Jack in the Box,62,Always open late and the 2 tacos for 99 cents are ALWAYS consistent. Thanks Jack in the Box for my 2 am snacks. I heard there is a sweet digital soda machine inside now that I have to try.
Taco Bell,1,Lately I have been reading how robots will one day take over some of human jobs. For example  fast food workers will one day be replaced by robots.  Honestly  was all for this  with the mentality   at least they ll get my order correct .  Today that feeling changed. For the first time in a LONG time  I had a wonderful experience at a fast food joint.   I am a pretty picky and particular person. I had an odd request and the lovely cashier Erica  whom never stopped smiling   went out of her way  spoke to the kitchen to make sure they understood my request before placing the order and she was so sweet about it. Mario  kitchen attended  possibly the manager  was very humorous and popped a few jokes while he was asking me to make sure he understood what I wanted. Jose  cook  made my order after Mario explained the order to him. Mario brought me my food  made sure it met my expectations.   I am a very shy person who is easily misunderstood. This experience was uplifting and put a smile on my face.   The staff is fantastic and actually care about guest satisfaction.   The personal interaction was a great feeling and I hope now that robots don t take over jobs like this. I find interacting with others important  especially one as pleasant as this one was.
Taco Bell,2,Taco Bell on 1016 Anderson is not ADA complaint.  They only want you to order via kiosk  but it doesn t if customer is visually impaired and can t see screen.  After being told by staff  must wait to get help because there is no Coulter help.  45 minutes later  another customer had to assist.  Was at location for 1 hour  and 15 minutes to get a take out lunch.
Taco Bell,3,Just left this location and I can t see myself coming back to this location any time soon.The wait was ridiculously long  costumer service was awful from the start.I made the mistake of not checking all of the items to make sure they were there and had to come back for a missing burrito.I tried calling the location multiple times to see if I could get the burrito through the dine in entrance since the drive through line was much longer now.Of course there was no answer and when I finally got to the speaker I was told my order can t be received at this moment even tho I had already paid for it.Finally someone with common sense understood the situation and was told to go ahead to the window.Once at the window a rude lady asked what Item  was supposedly missing  with an attitude.If you have to visit this location make sure to check all of your items are in the bag.
Taco Bell,4,Took 25 min to get my order and I was practically the only customer there. Definitely need some better employees. Definitely steering clear of this place in the future.
Taco Bell,5,This has got to be the absolute worst Taco Bell I have ever. My girlfriend and I stopped to grab some food about 1130 on July 4th  and  the got our entire 25 dolllar order wrong  and when we went back to have them fix it  the large Hispanic female wasn t going to open the door and assist us. When she finally got around to opening the door  to help us she wanted to argue and give us hard about fixing our order. When she final decided to fix the order  she only fixed half of it. When when we asked for the rest of the order she demanded our receipt  after she took the receipt and proceeded to walk around the store  till she decided it was time for her to leave. This lady who ever she is   wouldn t give her  doesn t need to be working in the service industry. She calmed to be a manager but with Piss poor customer service I highly doubt it..
Taco Bell,6,They had no food    The customer service was also not great. Do not recommend going here for a late night snack  
Taco Bell,7,I deliver for door dash  this T bell location has always been like iffy a pain to pick up orders from for a variety of reasons  starting with at least 2 or 3 times so far they ve just not had the order  in the system   and won t let me place it myself without EXITING the long line and ENTERING AGAIN  yes for real   so I end up having waited in a usually stupid long drive thru line for no reason  unlike every other T Bell in Austin  this location won t help u or bring it out for you if u call  they just tell u that u have to get in the drive thru and wait...hi hello  it s easier for all of us if I m not adding to your drive thru line when I don t have to be  . All that is whatever  there s always gonna be BS to deal with doing any app gig work  but one thing that gets me is unnecessary rudeness. Tonight I went here to pick up an order for door dash  entered the drive thru as usual and let them know I was picking up door dash and the name on the order. Then tell me why at the window I got attitude from the staff handing me the food  she tells me  you can t just drive up into the drive thru  you have to let us know on the mic you re picking up door dash . I m confused  since I did do exactly that...so I tell her so and say  oh yeah I did that  I let whoever was on the mic know...  and then she SHUTS the window on me while I m still speaking and gives me some major stink eye. Just the rudeness is so defeating and bothersome  like girl we re both in the service industry just out here tryna make our money  the very very least we can do is not be a  holes to one another in the process. Is that too much to ask 
Taco Bell,8,Don t order the sweet tea at this location. I was craving Taco Bell sweet tea  so I chose this location for my lunch stop today instead of the other surrounding options. After I received my order and pulled away from the window  I tasted my drink and it was hands down the nastiest tea that I have ever tasted. It tasted like it had soured and been left out for several days. I only took two small sips and I felt physically ill.
Taco Bell,9,I don t care what ya ll say about Taco Bell but you know damn well that they ve been there for you when you were broke  You were ballin on a budget when you ordered here  I always had their back  I think the ones who talk about having the runs are the ones who ve never been through the struggle... All in all Taco Bell continues to amaze with all the new things they keep coming up with. Their Cinnamon Delights Are Da Bomb    But weird that you can only choose between an order of 2 or 10. There s no in between.  lol. Just get the 10    Lol. Other than that. My go to from there are Cheesy Gordita Crunch with the Doritos Nacho Shell Instead  Tostadas  and their Nacho Bell Grande with lettuce on top. Feel free to give them a go 
Taco Bell,10,Fool me once..... so the saying goes. Did I learn from my previous visits   Noooo No more - Absolutely no more will I give this place my money  I ordered a steak flat bread and its chicken.  I ordered a steak Gordita - it has barely half a scoop of meat    I use to work for Taco Bell  I know the portions I should be getting.  To say this is to make more profit is an understatement   R I D I C U L O U S  I m done - stay away - even for a cheap place  you should be ashamed 
Taco Bell,11,Taco Bell I m confused as hell...  I pulled up to the window and was greeted very nicely but when I when I asked to order a quesarito they told me I could only order it on the app. I even clarified  so if I back up and place the order online I can order the item   She confirmed... I honestly don t understand the logic here  I wanted what I was craving so I backed up and ordered it online in the parking lot and came back thru saying I was here to pick up.  The biggest disappointment turned into how my chicken quesarito ended up being beef... This location needs to get it together
Taco Bell,12,I will preface this by saying that we know it s a Taco Bell and what that gets you. However  I thought it would get me more than one ounce of nacho cheese in a two-ounce cup.   When we brought this to the manager s attention  along with the missing chips and taco -- all of which were flattened and stale   they said it was standard to serve the container half full.   They replaced the missing items but only a after they refused to give a refund as we no longer wanted the subpar food. We will be giving our patronage to Taco Cabana from now on.
Taco Bell,13,I ordered cinnamon twist with my order. I didn t get them. I asked for hot sauce. Didn t get any. Not even 1 napkin to accompany my food. Now  I m home with an upset child because I promised her cinnamon twist. Thanks guys  Oh  and it was not even close to be being busy.
Taco Bell,14,So I went to the store to redeem a coupon and for a supreme no crunchy taco I ended up getting a regular taco but I guess they re trying to trick me so they could save a few cents here and there they wrapped it up in a supreme taco wrapper put it in the bag and sent me on my way I don t appreciate the trickery involved of miss labeling the taco just to get me him through the window I ll talk to the mail store manager of which didn t resolve anything I ended up calling corporate office will see what they do I would take note for the lack of star positive star readings at most Taco Bell s get because there are definite lack of any professional customer service if that Taco BellIs the Toria s for it s over seasoned beef small portions and lack of customer service
Taco Bell,15,Rude slow morons work the night shift here.  Don t order online  There s no point they just wait til you get there anyway.
Taco Bell,16,They were out of nacho cheese.  No big deal I say.    Go ahead and just put shredded cheese on the 3 items.   They told me they would have to upcharge the difference for EVERY single item in my order.  Are you ____ing kidding me.  You want me to pay for Erica the manager s mistake.  It s not our fault you re out of cheese  Erica        The nerve.  This place is now the worst ever.  Ridiculous        I ll never go back  and with so many Taco Bells in the area...you shouldn t waste your time or money 
Taco Bell,17,Went to eat lunch at the E Anderson location and when we received our food we noticed our Mexican pizza had red hair on top of it. I went inside to let the manager know what was found on the pizza  only to find out it was the Manager s hair that was in our food. I asked to speak with the manager  Erica  and she yells out she would not be speaking with me as if my hair was found in her food    As she is wrapping her hair in a bun and putting a hair net over the bun . Jose who was working the window comes to the front and says very rudely he is the manager and no one had time to speak with me   after I was told ERICA WAS THE MANAGER   I then ask if I could have a number to someone over Erica and Jose  Jose gave me a number  the wrong number  to Ana. I then googled the main office and received a call back from ANA only to find out it was the wrong number 
Taco Bell,18,It s Taco Bell so you already know to adjust expectations. Is the food prepared reasonably well and served in the proper temperature  If so  they pass. Unfortunately  there have been numerous times when the food has not been heated up properly so loss of marks there. I will say however  that the professional behavior by the staff at this location is really warm and welcoming every-time I have gone inside this location. Truly a pleasant surprise 
Taco Bell,19,Went there for lunch last Wednesday  the three tacos I ordered had 1 4 of the toppings that they should have. The portions have gotten tiny.  I ve eaten there for years and never had a problem. I suppose a new manager is in charge and trying to increase profits.
Taco Bell,20,This place is normally good. But lately the quality is getting lower. I ordered tacos and 3 Burritos and all my tacos are broken on the bottoms  and tasted like they been sitting out all day. They really need to work on there quality control. I m not happy about wasting 20 
Taco Bell,21,So I keep my expectations pretty low when it comes to any Taco Bell in America  mostly because its really hard to mess things up but for some reason the people here have no idea what they re doing. Taco Bell is one of those fast food chains that can make most things with beans instead of beef but somehow the people here always get my order wrong  which is tough because I am vegetarian. Every single order I get I always have to recheck  and then go back in or drive thru again so they can replace it. This is so stupid because I always get my order to go  why should I have to double it all the time    Someones being incredibly lazy here. The only reason I didn t give it one star is because they gave me free desserts one night for messing up my order.
Taco Bell,22,This is the worst Taco Bell I have ever been to. Some of the female staff are ghetto and incompetent. The female manager acts like she can t control her employees. I will no longer be going to this specific location. And yet fast food people want  15 hr give me a break you don t deserve it if you have a nasty attitude. Oh and I recently went to this location and I recorded the customer service and a fat woman sitting on her behind was texting and asked me why am I recording her and that she was doing her job. First off  you have the right to record anyone in a public area read the laws and second she should have went elsewhere where she couldn t be seen if she wanted to sit on her behind and text on her phone. Nothing but unprofessional people that work here 
Taco Bell,23,I gave them one more star. Come on  the lady was trying hard and she doesn t have to take her job seriously  you know. They were also fast  although I did get there early. I tried The Nacho Fries Bell Grande. A taste double dare  I don t think so. I eat out too much. I ll probably end up going for another wack at it  as well as the smaller Nacho Fries. It was good  though. I just keep waiting for the burger places to come up with a hot dog burger or something.
Taco Bell,24,You know that Taco Bell is hit or miss.   I rarely go to Taco Bell. I have been twice in 6 months and both times my order was missing an item. On 08 18 16 at 12 00PM the teller enters the order correctly  the line making the food not only forget an item again  the food was also poorly made. When you don t care than no care is taken when making the food. I will not be back to this location. I think the consensus is in. This location is not worth your time. Unless you don t care than this is the location for you 
Taco Bell,25,Showed up at 8pm and they said they were not taking orders. Staff was just hanging out in the drive through. Will never come back. Person in the drive through was rude and condescending.
Taco Bell,26,Best tacobell around. Gave me a coupon for a free biscuit taco on Cinco de Mayo. They are kind of stingy with the fire sauce packets. You gotta ask for salsa and syrup for your waffle taco  see pic  . I AM A BREAKFAST DEFECTOR  
Taco Bell,27,Told me they had run out of beans at midnight.  Closes at 1am.  Just went by another Taco Bell and asked if this is even possible..   They told me unequivocally NO.  Beef yes  but they d have it restocked within the hour.  I thought I smelled something fishy with this.  Many years going to this location and you have to guess which end of the burrito has the sauce.  I got complacent..or lazy.  Went to Taco Bell a week ago in Cedar Park and that told me just how good this food should be.  Sauce end to end  fresh tasting etc.  I m not sure how you get so bad at making such basic food as the 183 Norwood Park location has gotten  or been  but it is dumbfounding.  DO NOT EAT at this location.
Taco Bell,28,Drive thru order. Quick and easy. Cashier was on point. Wasn t constantly asking if I wanted anything else. In and out in 43 seconds.
Taco Bell,29,First if they were out of nacho fries. Then the credit card machine declined my card twice  So then after being on hold for fifteen minutes with my bank  they tell me my card is fine. It s taco Bell machines. The tables were dirty. I had to ask for a straw  and napkins because they weren t stocked. I don t suggest going here.
Taco Bell,30,I love Taco Bell  but this location frequently doesn t open on time  and if they even acknowledge your existence it s with an annoyed  we re not ready yet . It s about a 50 50 chance you can grab some breakfast in between 7 and 7 30am  they open at 7  supposedly . On top of that  they may be out of sauce at that time somehow. Pretty disorganized in the morning.
Taco Bell,31,I just had an excellent experience at this location. It was clean and well stocked but the best part was the woman running the register. Her name is Donna and she greeted every customer brightly  made sure everyone got their orders and anything else they may need  and had a generally pleasant and welcoming demeanor. She alone would make me return to this particular store.
Taco Bell,32,You have got to be kidding me   Wrong ordered like holy crap  My fianc  had to drive back to get it figured out  and still came home with the wrong food    It s not a hard job  Screw this location  we both work in the food industry  but if a manager can t get things right  then someone needs to get fired  It s fast food  Wtf   Is all I need to say  Corporate look into this location  We will not be back  It s Texas so many other options around especially for Mexican food              Not to mention your system sucks as well probably because all of your complaints at the moment  and don t think I won t say something to corporate they will hear from me 
Taco Bell,33,Your standard Taco Bell  although this one did not give me food poisoning. Bonus  This place is good for what it is - Taco Bell.   Their customer service is quick and efficient  at least at the drive-thru . No complaints 
Taco Bell,34,I seldom write reviews. Mostly because I m easily satisfied and my bar for customer service is pretty low. I ve given this particular taco bell multiple chances and every single time they have let me down. I m writing this review because of my visit today was probably the worst I ve had.    I walk into this chaos erupting between a worker there and her apparent grandchildren. She is losing a lung screaming at them and bounces back and forth between being inside and outside. I feel   well  this is okay  everyone has a crazy family  sure.  So I try to order and I m told to wait because they for some reason don t have a drawer open at 5 PM. I wait about ten minutes and suffer through more exchanges between grandma and her grandkids and the whole time there is another worker looking at me apologetically.  I m still on board  this is fine and I can wait.  Enter these two old ladies  they come in and sprawl around looking at the menu and don t even mind my existence  despite being first in line. They warm up to grandma worker and make small talk and give out their order and I look at the other worker and I look at grandma and it s decided that it s fine that customers are allowed to cut in line.   Look  I realize that Taco Bell isn t some last bastion of customer service and nor should it be  I believe they are aware of what they re peddling  a greasy scummy treat that you give yourself to scratch a certain unexplainable itch. I m absolutely done with this particular Taco Bell and I think I m done with the franchise as a whole.   TL DR  this taco bell sucks and don t bother. Travel the extra little bit and go to Arby s down the road for trashy fast food.
Taco Bell,35,The guy who took our order was a total bro. I told him I d write a good review on yelp for his outstanding bro-ness  and goddammit thats what im going to do.  Allow me to paint you a picture.   Austin  Texas.  1 15 am.  Approximately 4.5 million degrees.   The sound of cicadas and unnervingly-close gunfire permeate the torrid night air.  Contrary to what television and those stupid pictures you see every ten seconds on facebook would have you believe  one can not buy groceries with swag  which we have in nearly criminal amounts  thus our apartment is nearly devoid of all food.   After about a week of failed attempts at finding ways to cook and eat swag  we decided we better eat something tangible  as the hunger hallucinations seemed to be getting worse by the hour.  We braved the gunfire and bird-sized flying insects and made a frantic  flailing sprint to our vehicle.  Safely  thanks for asking.  We arrived at this Taco Bell  emaciated and disoriented  but alive  having survived on the a fore mentioned swag alone.  The man taking our order was very patient as we struggled through the daunting task of trying to order tacos while hiding hungerections caused by the excitement of being so close to real food for the first time in weeks. If that sounds awkward to you  try being in the car at the time. Moving on.  Minutes  or possibly hours  later  we successfully communicated our desires to the magic food dispensing talking box  which told us to drive up to the window.   The guy at the window was incredibly friendly  and I briefly considered asking him to be my super best friend  but I then felt that may have been too much of a commitment this early into the relationship. Baby steps.  He told us our total  and with doe eyes we held out a wad of crumpled bills and some sweaty coins and asked if this was enough to make our stomach hurts go away.   Yes.  he said  voice shaking ever so slightly.  Yes it is.   and cupping his hands together  collected our humble offerings  disappearing into the fluorescent food  palace of salvation.  It was at this moment that I noticed the huge poster in the window of the Doritos Locos Taco  and because I have the mind of a child  I m all  Oh hellz yeah  gotta get me some of that shit    So as our Mighty Taco Lord came back to give us our change  I ordered one of those too. He wasn t annoyed at this in the slightest  suggesting that either he has kids  or maybe he s actually  for realzies  Jesus. I m thinking Jesus  because not only did he get me that taco...he said it was on the house  if I just did him a solid and took some survey.   I think thats how Scientoligists get people  but whatever  free taco   Our order  including my last minute addition  were made exactly as we asked. No tomatoes on my taco  no ice in our drink  everything was perfect. Not only is Taco Jesus super nice  he s also a good listener  ladies .  Not only was everything made to perfection  it was also ready very quickly. Like  seriously. Ninja fast. Everything was done before we even knew it started  uhh...ladies    So would I recommend this place  I d recommend you thank it for making sunny days and pretty girls every night before you go to bed  fool.  I hope Taco Jesus the Mega Bro reads this so he understands the difference being nice to one person can make. I wish I would ve remembered your name  dude.   P.S. That was my first Doritos Locos taco and it was fucking amazing.   --Stay Rad                                                                                                  Charlie Spleen
Taco Bell,36,Donna is the best cashier server I ve ever experienced in fast food. She is energetic  smiles  acknowledges customers and really shows passion in her job. Kudos more could learn from her.
Taco Bell,37,This is the closest taco bell to my house and it is open late so it is the natural choice to head here when I am heading home from the bars and need something to soak up the drink.   It s cheap  it s fast  it s Taco Bell. That s really all you need to know.
Taco Bell,38,Taco perfection I go out of my way to go to this place  its always superfast And the order is perfect. I m still stuck on the Doritos taco 5 box Its cheap and comes with a drink . O yah and taco bell  has some  Okay treats . To cap it all off the staff was fff great . This is my taco bell
Taco Bell,39,I have never in my life gone to a restaurant were no  one was willing to help customers. This location closed early without anything being posted. There were employees there but they wouldn t help anyone. This is the worst place I have been and they obviously don t care if they are in business. This place is HORRIBLE. Don t waste your time.
Taco Bell,40,I ve driven off from drive-thru at least 3 times after the person was rude for no reason.  I will not pay a business that is not respecting me and automatically gives me attitude instead of welcoming me.  This is by far the worse Taco Bell around me.  I believe managers should really look at reviews on yelp or any other website and make a change.
Taco Bell,41,Worst service ever was waiting for more than 30 min.Once i finally got my food it looked like shit like a 3 year old  preparing it  i asked for my money back i wasnt going to eat the food it was all messy inside the bag alot of ppl were leaving because they were taking so damn long dont come here they cant run a business that slow.
Taco Bell,42,Not open 24 7 like yelp says it is. I don t partake in. Fast food often so this is definitely a bummer
Taco Bell,43,I ve never been to a fast food place that has superb customer service as this place. Taco Bell is taco bell. Can t expect the food to be 5 stars fresh food. But the service is awesome 
Taco Bell,44,Ok I think I am done with Taco Bell.  Their customer service is absolutely horrible. What these people need to understand is that there is absolutely nothing convenient about their service.  I would almost be willing to pay a little more to get a better customer experience  but their service is so absolutely fucking atrocious  that it behooves me why I keep going back.  I love the taste of their food  but the fact that I cannot even feel secure in the fact that when I have to walk in EVERY fucking time and tell them that they did not get the order right  something is seriously wrong.         So I go through the drive-thru to order 2 bean and cheese burritos  1 mexican pizza without tomatoes  and 2 volcano burrito s with extra meat and 10 fire sauces.  I had repeat myself to the lady taking the order literally 3 times to make sure that they got it correct.  Well the way Taco Bell Drive through works is that they do not give you the actual receipt till they give you the food and it is included into the bag.  I never quite understood that as its not like they are not supplied with computers to help them facilitate the oder.  But for some reason the receipt was never given until the food is given to the customer.  That being said  I paid for the food and of course did not get 10 ft before I found out that they did it again     They put tomatoes on the Mexican Pizza.  On top of that they only gave me 1 bean and cheese burrito  but then again they only charged me for 1 bean and cheese burrito.  So I go into the store and walk up to the counter with the issue.  There was this very heavy set woman going behind the counter when I asked her if she was the one that I spoke to over the comm.  Her reply was   Do I look like I am wearing a headset    I said   Fair enough  and I asked for the person I was speaking to at.  She came out  and she really didn t say much as I was pretty heated at the time.   The cashier came out  looked onto the receipt and advised me that I never placed the 2nd burrito order.  Also that their sauce on the Mexican pizza comes with tomatoes into the sauce  which BTW when we ordered it without tomatoes  and the fucking sauce did not come with it in it.  Either way he took the pizza back and made another one without any sauce at all.  I mean no sauce    Then they gave me an extra bean and cheese burrito and did not charge me for it which was fine  but the fact that they got the order wrong every time is just absolutely baffling.  I mean even based on statistics  they would have had to get it right once maybe every 10 times or so.  That is just not the case.   On top of that they took the receipt from me so I had a serious time just complaining about it.      So my wife calls when I get back as I was so pissed off about it  that it was best that she call.  She gets the manager who states that there was no person that came in to complain today to them about this.  It s not like I did not even exist and was refusing to give the number of his supervisor  but at the end of the call we were able to obtain it.  My wife spoke to Eddie who was the supervisor over the store and explained the circumstance  which in the end he just wanted to provide us with free food.  When we complain about something  we do not ask for free food based on the fact that it feels that we get something for nothing.  So she politely declined and explained that when we complain about service  it is not about free food  it is about the customer experience that went so horribly awry  that we felt that we had no other option but to complain to someone about this experience that can do something to change this.  But to be honest  I do not feel that anything in the end will ever change with Taco Bell.  I know it is Mexican food  but the fact that they cannot get one person that can understand or comprehend mathematics or english for that matter is amazing to me.  I apologize that I force them to pull out the ESL  English as a second language  courses  but what is the point when they work in a predominantly English speaking country and cannot comprehend the use of the numeric system in English or what you are actually saying except for key words.  It creates a language barrier as well as a poor customer experience overall.  I hate even bringing up the language barrier  but if there is one in a country where people are supposed to understand English  than why is this happening       I am so fucking done with Taco Bell in Texas.  I love the taste of the food but the serious lack of customer service as well as the lack of consistency from store to store is just horrific.
Taco Bell,45,Okay  so I have to admit something here. I don t usually eat this much fast food but I live with my girlfriend and she...she decided we should have some time apart. I know this isn t the place to talk about this but half the people in my office have been sick or something...I don t know but I don t really have many friends. I have trouble with people and I thought that Clara udnerstood me but I don t know if that is going to work out and I don t know what to do.  Anyway Clara would do all the cooking and so I m eating out alot now. So yesterday for lunch I went to Taco Bell on Anderson. I generally really like this place and have gone several times. But yesterday I went in and it was completely empty. There was not a sole there. There were cars in the parking lot but no one at the tables or behind the counter or in the bathroom. I stood there for 15 minutes  I could have gone in the back and made my own darn chicken gordita    Anyway I went back to  work and ate some peanut butter in the break room. I thought about going back to that Mcdonalds with that kid in the bathroom because I m starting to get an infectoin but things have been wierd lately. It feels like people haven t been showing up to life lately  you know 
Taco Bell,46,Drive thru was incredibly slow. It litterly took 30 mins after ordering to get up to the window. And by the time I got the food it was cold  I sent a complaint but got no feedback. I find it funny that I was sitting by the back window long enough to read the managers comments to the team on the back office door that said they have 0 speed
Three B's Tacos,1,I make it my mission to visit this food truck whenever I m in Austin. The tacos are  delicious and reasonably priced. There s something about getting them from a truck on the side of the road that s charming
Three B's Tacos,2,The food was barely edible. Cold shredded cheese  miniscule shrimp  similar to what you d get in a top ramen cup   flavorless  lukewarm. I was really hungry but tossed over half because I was concerned about getting sick.
Three B's Tacos,3,Over priced . The food taste like everything is store bought and served straight out of the packaging . I would not recommend this food truck at all .
Three B's Tacos,4,I am astounded to see the favorable reviews. Maybe the management turned the truck over to a third party during SXSW  The prices are all suspiciously missing from the menu. They are price-gouging  I know it is SXSW but COME ON   and they don t warn you before they take your money that they are out of most of the stuff you want. They just substitute or omit the food and not offer a refund. They charged me extra for a brisket taco and then gave me a chicken taco. I was tired of arguing with them at that point  which I had to do at the top of my lungs because the generator makes it very noisy. I am seriously turned off of taco trucks after this experience.
Three B's Tacos,5,Worst decision I have ever made during SXSW. Food is disgusting  not what I ordered and paid for  and overpriced. Avoid.
Three B's Tacos,6,Not that good. They were ok and food was very minimal for price. If I m paying over  3 for taco I expect it to be filling or have enough meat and toppings.
Three B's Tacos,7,Their truck came to my apartment complex and I absolutely loved the delicious brisket sliders and the potato salad    I was excited to hear that they also do nachos and tacos... I ll have to make my way over to their stationary spot and grab some 
Three B's Tacos,8,These tacos were really good. I ve had their Al Pastor tacos and a bacon and egg taco.   The al pastor was solid. Great flavor and they didn t skimp on the fillings. I felt like I got my money s worth in that department. They have plenty of sauces to try but you can definitely have these solo and be fine.   Now  I have high standards when it comes to breakfast tacos and despite their reputation  the city of Austin is lacking in that department. That said  the bacon and egg taco was really good. The tortilla was warmed up on the grill  the bacon was top notch  and they used real eggs. My only advice would be to cook the eggs and bacon together. That would make this bacon and egg taco the best in town  hands down.   I definitely recommend giving this place a try.
Three B's Tacos,9,I know the name says tacos... but you must try their brisket nachos... loaded down with goodnessssss 
Three B's Tacos,10,Most amazing tacos ever  Great service and great food  After a night out in Austin I stopped here and I was not disappointed at all  Highly recommend the chicken tacos they re delicious 
Three B's Tacos,11,Kept walking around the city   and found this spot. The brisket burrito was delicious and my mom order the crispy tacos.. very delicious food  
Three B's Tacos,12,The food here is absolutely amazing   I eat here every chance I get. The prices of the food are very fair for the amount of food given. The atmosphere is ever changing as is the menu. This is a must stop food truck in my opinion  which is not given lightly   10 thumbs up    
Three B's Tacos,13,Tried the chicken taco and beef taco   taco style   onions and cilantro . Delicious   Loved the choices of salsas  too. I will definitely be back.
Three B's Tacos,14,I ordered delivery  they gave nachos since they were out of dip  amp  chips. The nacos came with stadium cheese only. Cheese was all over the bag  amp  my drinks. The pastor tacos were cold  amp  meat was rubbery. Everything was disgusting.
Three B's Tacos,15,The only positive that I found about this place is that it is open till 3 am. I had the brisket tacos. Food is sub par and not great quality at all. Hands down one of the worst tacos I ve had in Austin. Became sick for the whole day after eating these tacos. I do not recommend unlessOther alternatives in the area that are great quality are Pueblo viejo and las trancas.
Taco Bell,1,Friendly and super honest group. Expectally. The cashier Ethan I think his name is. I over paid him and he was honest and gave back the dollar I over paid. He was a super star today in my book.
Taco Bell,2,Wow. I m not sure what s going on with this location but I ve had multiple attempts  mobile orders  to get a meal only to drive there for pickup and be told that they either couldn t fulfill the order or even take the order.   So. Order at your own risk but have a back up plan.
Taco Bell,3,The kiosk ordering here helps a ton.  You can customize pretty much anything to your heart s content.  You had better like the kiosk  because you re unlikely to be helped at the counter.  Also  this Taco Bell is extremely slow.  But if you re willing to use the kiosk and wait a bit  you can get pretty much any Taco Bell creation you can dream up and it ll be pretty ok.
Taco Bell,4,Maria the manager called me a little sh t. I was confused and frustrated why they canceled my online order that I paid for  and without any explanation  she started calling me profane names.
Taco Bell,5,They stop taking orders way  earlier than before the store displayed closing  hours. You re better off grabbing food somewhere else because chances are they will close early for some unknown reason and you ll be sitting in a line of cars for 20  minutes while the cars ahead of you sit there confused trying to figure out why they can t order. Head to McDonalds or Whataburger instead
Taco Bell,6,I don t usually review fast food places  but this place is awful. If you go anytime after 5 pm  prepare to wait at least 20 minutes in the drive thru. Also with recent items coming back   Mexican pizza  amp  toasted chalupa  they claim to  not be able to make them right now. 
Taco Bell,7,By far the slowest T Bell you will ever go to.    BY FAR.    I ve been sitting in line for 19 minutes and I would have left but I m blocked in.  This place is slower than Joe Biden s thought process.
Taco Bell,8,Extremely slow. Not optimized for a drive thru. Understaffed. Pls fix. I do not recommend this place
Taco Bell,9,I ve literally been sitting in the drive-through for 20 minutes now  and only 3 cars have moved. It s as if everyone that works here is asleep. No matter what time you come here there s 10 cars in line and you ll be sitting in the drive-through for 30 minutes. I don t know what the hell the employees in here are doing. I have never ever witnessed a fast food location that is so ridiculously slow. The only conclusion I can draw is  the staff is ridiculously lazy  or they re just horribly understaffed. Can t really tell which one it is.  What the hell is wrong with this place  Absolutely the SLOWEST service imaginable. I ended up leaving after sitting in the drive-through for 23 minutes with only three cars moving. Go to El Tacorido down the street. Do not come here 
Taco Bell,10,I always felt like it was stupid and over the top to review a fast food place lol. These poor food service industry folks catch enough Karen s and disrespect as it is. But holy cow  my experience here today was comically sucky. First of all  all the love to the late night crew. They get slammed every day and work their butts off and are generally NICE. Today I went in at around 11 30 AM and apparently really ruined all these horribly rude and apparently miserable women s days by accidentally asking for a sauce they don t have. Pulled up to the window to hear them making fun of me and mocking me LOUDLY in front of an OPEN WINDOW. We all complain about customers but if y all could try rubbing your last few brain cells together and realize that it s probably not the best to do it in front of the open window. Fast food workers already have to deal with so much crap it s insane to me that you d be so rude to a customer that is actually nice and respectful to you  just because they had a slip up and ordered an item you were out of. I m in the food beverage industry and would NEVER be rude to workers but to pull up and hear  DID I F UCKING SAY FIRE SAUCE    Being screamed across the restaurant about me... making fun of me..... over sauce..... y all need hobbies..... or anger management..... who raised you.  Oh yeah  and the real kicker is the food sucked and she gave me THE WRONG SAUCE hahah.  DID I F CKING SAY DIABLO SAUCE    
Taco Bell,11,Taco bell owner of this lication..location... you need to see what is happening in your business.  They can only process 1 car at a time.  I have been in line for 18 minutes just to order... yes I would have left by now but I am trapped by other cars.  This is ridiculous.
Taco Bell,12,They said they took their last order 2 hours before they closed tonight and then we just had to sit in the drive thru lane till the cars in front of us left. Nice waste of time and now other actual restaurants are closed   
Taco Bell,13,Worst customer service ever  Hispanic lady and young Hispanic male extremely rude and both laughed at me because I asked for a refill while waiting on my dam order. Last time I eat on this shitty Taco Bell on 201E. Oltorf St.
Taco Bell,14,The slowest  fast food  restaurant in austin by far . IS A TACO BELL    Not a fancy restaurant to wait 30 min in a non exit trap drive through
Taco Bell,15,Terrible experience every time always takes way longer than a drive-through should the staff here are just super slow unacceptable for fast food standards
Taco Bell,16,Terrible customer service. Refused to fix leaving out half of my order that I have a receipt for
Taco Bell,17,Here I am coming back from college  ordering Taco Bell and I just met the nicest woman in the whole world  taking my order she was so sincere and nice and I want to give her the biggest hug she is the reason why I had a good Sunday God bless the woman talking to me all the Taco Bell drive-through
Taco Bell,18,Quite possibly the slowest fast food ever. Dining room isn t open ever so drive thru is always backed up  no matter what time of day. Drove by around 11 pm last night and there was a line literally out onto the street. They need to fix their staffing issues ASAP or just close.
Taco Bell,19,I ve been to this taco bell so many times  and usually love it like a normal taco bell. But dude  I ordered 4 chalupas that the shells were all CRAZY STALE.  Super  super gross. Don t know if that s this taco bells fault  or if taco bell has new shells for the chalupas. But super gross. I m put off from taco bell for a while now.   One positive thing-- their baja blast is never out of syrup  so it s never watered-down.
Taco Bell,20,Hispanic or white chick with brown hair in a bun working the drive thru was extremely rude for no reason tonight. Asked how she was doing on the speaker and she said  bad what do you want    then proceeded to tell me  don t make a large order cus I won t take the order  even tho it was just me in the drive thru .. and then finally yelled and cussed at me when I was trying to leave the drive thru. If this is how you guys run y all s business then  I ll take my business elsewhere. I know not to expect much from Taco Bell in general but a little respect goes along way.
Taco Bell,21,There is rushing an order to satisfy the customers appetite  and there is just rushing an order which I experienced this evening. I m all about second chances  and even after my last experience at the Oltorf TB  when adjusting my order at the window by requesting  NO ONIONS  on our burritos  I was shocked when the attendant said they were already made. I gave a shocked face  to give a second to think about that one for second.  Do I force the customer to buy something he doesn t want   A second past  as did I to the Golden Arches. C mon TB Oltorf  please get it together.
Taco Bell,22,This place I had rated at 4 stars  but today I went there at 2pm and was shocked at home w disgusting the men s bathroom was. What made it ironic was the employees must wash sign on the door.
Taco Bell,23,I went through the drive through at 2 04 pm on January 20th and ordered 2 separate orders. On my second order I asked for a Coke and they didn t have it so they offered me a Pepsi and I said yes. Got our food drove off and realized I didn t get my Pepsi  so we went back through the line. First off the lady was very rude claiming she already gave it to us  then she said we never ordered it wanting us to pay for another Pepsi. She shut the door then the what I m assuming was the manager opened it and greeted us with  what s the problem   And I said we didn t get my Pepsi that I paid for and HE instantly responded with  first off watch the attitude  we didn t have attitude we just wanted our drink. And he said  I can read body language so   He just looked at the other lady and said  get them their Pepsi  and slammed the drive through door.   Overall it was a terrible and unprofessional experience. The manager was talking to us as if we weren t paying customers. I will never go back there.
Taco Bell,24,I drive thru here when running late to my job at St. Ed s and always get the same super friendly and competent sweet lady -- she s fast  sharp  sweet. Yes it s a fast food drive through but come on -- NOT BAD for a  4 lunch   
Taco Bell,25,For a Taco Bell  it gets 5 stars.  They never mess up my orders  amp  they are always super friendly.
Taco Bell,26,Refused to let us order because we were making a personal order  and not a favor doordash order. ..I mean what   Isn t that discrimination  Yes. Yes it is. Go to taco C instead  this place is trash. Corporate needs to examine this location
Taco Bell,27,This is the worst Taco Bell I have ever been to. I drove 10 minutes to this location only to find out  they only were doing uber eats orders . Is this a joke  New management is needed here
Taco Bell,28,I ordered extra chicken and cheese with my Chipotle Chicken Melts. It wasn t as much as I was expecting  based off previous experiences. That being said the quality was great. The chicken was moist and the cheese was melted well.
Taco Bell,29,8 24 19 drive-through   OK  uh  we re closed due to a shortage of staff.  Man.
Taco Bell,30,Absolutely Horrible Service     No matter how many times I ask for NO ONIONS      Even having them read it back to me and it saying plain as day on my receipt No Onions they get me everytime.  It s annoying to get home after waiting 20 mins for them to even fill the order to find out it s wrong. Like here s my money give me what I specifically asked not for. Lol Dumbest Taco Bell I  Austin. Where do they find these people   
Taco Bell,31,I hate to post on yelp but I ll tell you right now that I ve been coming to this location for two years and I ve seen constant terrible service since I ve moved here. I can t believe a business can actually stay floating with the horrible customer service and disgusting attitudes from the staff. I wish I could get what I ordered but I guess that s too much to ask for. This store should be shut down. This has been happening for the past two years. Yeah I keep coming back  but only because I like Taco Bell. This one store is a disgrace.
Taco Bell,32,Poorly ran even for a taco Bell. They jacked up my order and the food was under cooked. How do you make a quesadilla soggy  Also  no ice in the drink station.
Taco Bell,33,Literally my fave taco bell. The cashier is so nice and never judges how hungover i am
Taco Bell,34,I m currently trapped in the drive thru  I ve been here 15 minutes already and haven t moved forward 1 single car.... If I wasn t boxed in I would leave.... I am instantly filled with regret for coming here.
Taco Bell,35,Normally I don t have a problem with Taco Bell. It s just your standard taco and burrito chain restaurant. However every time I come here  my order is always messed up. I usually get the quesadilla with extra jalape o sauce on it. And what do I get   No sauce whatsoever on it  with all my meat and cheese in the two middle pieces  and nothing but tortillas on the sides. I can t tell you how annoyed I get. So I had to start getting extra on the side  which they make me pay for it.  Not only is the food orders incorrect  but the people they have working there  Well I say people  but I really mean person  The day manager there is incompetent  extremely rude and hurries you through your order. I don t know about you  but that to me is the definition of bad customer service  
Taco Bell,36,One of the slower taco bells. Only one in drive thru. Ordered about 6 items. Waited 10 minutes. By the time I left there were 5 cars behind me. Food was alright just really slow. Not  fast  food by any means. The new quesaditos are ok. Get the steak one if you are wanting to try one.
Taco Bell,37,I downloaded the Yelp app just to write about this Taco Bell.  Of all Taco Bell s  I genuinely fear for my guts
Taco Bell,38,Their hours are a lie. Every time I try to go there at 1 45am  they are always closed. If they want to close early  then just put that in the hours so people don t waste their time.
Taco Bell,39,They say you learn something new everyday  and today I learned that you can burn a crunch wrap supreme. Now I don t expect much from taco bell  who does  But today the low standards I do have where lowered again like some demented limbo stick. Bad service  burnt food  long wait  no reason to go back
Taco Bell,40,Horrible  horrible  horrible    Rude staff  under cooked food  and waste of money.  Taco Bell please train this franchise  because they need to up their standards and manners.
Taco Bell,41,The worst freaking Taco Bell I ve been to in my life. My entire order was wrong  they didn t have boxes for the 5  box I ordered and they didn t even have receipt paper    I even paid extra for some upgrades on tacos just to receive a regular ole taco like I didn t just pay extra for it. Avoid this Taco Bell  don t waste your time. Uglies
Taco Bell,42,Rudest staff ever  After years I have not eaten at Taco Bell... this reminded me of why I should ve kept avoiding Taco Bell. The guy at the register greeted us while he was on his phone and messed up our order. When we talked to him about our messed up order his manager showed up and still charged us double for the missing item. She was also very rude and as we ate our food she was cursing and talking about the situation that happened. I ll try my best to avoid this restaurant
Taco Bell,43,Great service every time.   After 20 years this place is still here  and still making decent fast food.
Taco Bell,44,Nothing special but if you are expecting something special from a Taco Bell then you need to check your expectations. The food is always hot and tastes as I would expect compared to other Taco Bell experiences. Very risky place to live next to after a night out drinking.
Taco Bell,45,I give this location 5 stars for their lunch time crew  I can t speak for the other hours of the day. I work downtown and grab lunch here once or twice a week. The service is ALWAYS great and they always get my order correct. My biggest reason for giving this location 5 stars is that the food is always fresh and hot. You can go to some locations and get a bean burrito and tell that the beans have been sitting for awhile because they are dry and cold  but not here. The beans are always fresh and have the perfect consistency. They make a perfect cheesy gordita crunch too. I ve never had a bad meal here. Major props to the manager and crew that run the store at lunch time. Y all deserve the recognition. Hope your higher ups see this  
Taco Bell,46,Consistently slow service. Can never figure out what the heck is going on at this location. Last time was the last straw. Waited at the counter for a solid 2-3 minutes for a cashier at 5pm on a weekday  wish the counter was furnished with a taco  bell .. The 3 other people waiting to place their order tolerated my dad joke . People walking around in the back made eye contact but didn t seem to care much. Order took much longer than you would expect. The kicker was the sign  ON A NAPKIN  on the napkin dispenser that said they were out of napkins..
Taco Bell,47,I came here on a Saturday night at 1 am and they were closed. The sign on the window says they stay open till 3 am Friday and Saturday. So THATS annoying  
Taco Bell,48,Long line at drive thru at lunch on Thursday. I went inside. Oops - big mistake  At least 7 guys in front of me. All construction workers needing to order. All dining in. I overheard the cashier telling one of them it would be 10 minutes for the food. really   And she didn t tell anyone else. Another big group of 6 had just placed their orders so  there were lots of orders ahead of me.    They had one prep line open for both dining in  take out and drive thru. IT took at least 12 minutes. For Taco Bell. For fast food. ugh. I stopped looking at the time. And all of the orders were combo meals. Nothing special. With that kind of wait  for a fast food place  they should have offered a free drink or dessert.
Taco Bell,49,I ve tried all the Taco Bells in the immediate region and this one is the best. The one of Riverside near Pleasant Valley is mediocre. The location on Lamar by Barton is OK. But this Oltorf location has got it right. I always order chicken quesadillas because of the sauce they put in  I have the recipe for their sauce but never make it but occasionally have intense cravings for it . Then I order random entrees from their drive-in menu.  I did not eat at Taco Bell for a long time. But those new Verde green sauce packets are delicious. I actually have some at my desk for ALL the meals.  The price is kinda high for fast food. I often order tacos for later or tacos for friends whereas McD s I usually shamefully order my overcaloried serving. Taco Cabana is far superior if they are nearby  but this local TB is great.
Taco Bell,50,Aight... I ve never been inside  and I haven t eaten anything from here in some time. Nope  the reason I make the run to the border here is for... yep... the Big Ole Pepsi.  I pretty much always get great service in the window here  but it s probably because I m not ordering  30 worth of food one taco at a time. When I need the sweet sweet elixir of relief  these guys got what I need.
Taco Bell,51,This is one of the better Taco Bells around the area that I stay in. The few times I ve been inside  it has been cleaned and they have done some updating so it looks nice. The staff has been very kind and attentive to any needs or mistakes in food. I tend to go through the drive through a bit more and yes there are lines at times. If your going between the hours of 1130-130  you might see a line. Its call an lunch rush and the same for dinner. You expect it. Regardless of it being a fast food restaurant  they do get slammed at times. Get over it    Other than that  my food has always been made to how I need it. I like extra red sauce on my bean burritos and this is one of the only Taco Bells that actually do it  Never had any problems with my food or major mistakes that have upset me. It seems as if they might have had new management  so the service level has increase in general.
Taco Bell,52,Have had bad expereinces  this was the WORST. Let s boil this down  hot chalupa shells are awesome. 8-10 times I order at any Taco Bell I get a luke warm chalupa shell  which totally ruins the chalupa. This time it was not warm but COLD. I get home and I got a Dr Pepper instead of Diet Pepsi... and to top things off  I got a rancid apple empanada. Only thing right about the meal was the taco. WHAT THE HELL  Taco Bell   Rancid     The rancid aftertaste still persists.
Taco Bell,53,Nasty restaurant... Poor service the employee in the lobby looked at me 3 times before finally asking what I needed when they messed up my order...
Taco Bell,54,With regard to the Taco Bell on Oltorf  78704   this place has perennially terrible service.  Yesterday  I purchased 2 Grande Scramblers and another meal  of which the gentleman forgot the second Scramber  drive-thru .  Today  I asked them to replace it with the order I made today  and said  you can decide if you want to or not .  Instead  I was greeted by the manager who began arguing with me  telling me that we got it...he asked me 3 times for a receipt.  I sped off after I gave him the money  without food  because I could tell he was more interested in escalating the argument than just deciding whether he wanted to replace the meal or not.   This place is just terrible  all up the chain.  Too bad  cause the scrambler is great.
Taco Bell,55,First i got there and the cashier was very rude  then i went inside to the restrooms  they were horribly not cleaned well  there was poop next to the toilet  the food was almost frozen if you want cold food then this is got to be the first choice for you because honestly it was very cold  i asked for 3 quesadillas and 2 doritos locos tacos and she didnt gave me the 2 doritos locos so i had to go back and ask for them again so not recommended
Taco Bell,56,Ice cold food that should have been served hot   A squirt of this sauce on this spot and a squirt of another sauce over yonder.  Do these  workers  deserve to to be paid a  livible  wage 
Taco Bell,57,Well what a experience   I arrived at 9 45 and ordered the guy at the counter asked in I was doing for here or to go   well I wanted to eat there  really don t like eating in the car  he informs me that there is 15 min till the lobby closes and I said that s cool I won t be long . I still down and start eating and at 9 56 I m approved and asked to leave ... I m like 5 min from being done and leaving and I m asked to leave early   The door was locked as well . A customer walked up as I was leaving and was denied even though it was not 10 .. Keep in Mind the drive through is open till 4 so the kitchen is not shitting down. So what really would it hurt to let me finish   Also the customer that walked up was there before close and was not served .. I ll drive to riverside location from now on
Taco Bell,58,Worst experience EVER   A co-worker and I decided to grab nachos on our lunch break. We work overnight  so this is around 2am.  We pull up and ask of we can place two separate orders. The guy SIGHS LOUDLY and reluctantly says yes. My friend orders first. She asks for a Nacho Bell Grande  no beef  add shredded chicken. No problem paying extra. We don t have the menu memorized  and we don t frequent this place often. She then asks him if the nachos come in a combo. He replies   Well yeah but you didn t ask for that   I m initially shocked. How rude  I tell her   wow  he s pretty rude.  He hears this and begins yelling at us through the loudspeaker  asking us if we have a problem  My friend says no  we just want to order. He proceeds to try to intimidate us and argue with us. We decide not to order and ask for a manager. He tells us he is the manager and his name is  Jim.  I doubt that. We pull around to the window  he refuses to acknowledge us or even apologize for his foolishness. I will Never go there again  and I will be calling corporate.
Taco Bell,59,I don t normally post on these sites but my experience here was beyond terrible  and I think others deserve to know. The service was horrible and the employee incredibly rude.  The employee actually tried verbally picking a fight with our group while we were ordering.  I enjoy Taco Bell  but will officially go out of my way to give anyone business besides this particular franchise
El Michoacano Mexican Restaurant,1,Wonderful and excellent  Can t wait to bring guests here. Loved all the dishes. It s right across from the airport so if your out of town guests want to eat Mexican Food  they will be pleased. Great beer margaritas 
El Michoacano Mexican Restaurant,2,Lil  hole in the wall  place. The service was great  The food was awesome  And the beer was cold   Can t wait to go back. If you are near the airport  this is a must stop.
El Michoacano Mexican Restaurant,3,Not very friendly  have a few fans in the back it gets windy and cold. The food is not very good and it s over priced.
El Michoacano Mexican Restaurant,4,Excellent and affordable. Simple street style food made genuine by the low brow building. Food matters here.
El Michoacano Mexican Restaurant,5,Awesome service and great people  Me and my boyfriend always make sure we stop by when we visit the area. The Pastor tacos are to die for  and the fluffy homemade tortillas always hit the spot 
El Michoacano Mexican Restaurant,6,We love this place. Great agua frescas.... any time we go to the airport we try and stop By. MY favorite Mexican food in Austin.
El Michoacano Mexican Restaurant,7,Only good thing is about this place  chips and salsa  Very dirty and there is no soap in restroom. Food is good and service is frienbut I would not go back. Too dirty...
El Michoacano Mexican Restaurant,8,This is a hole in the wall type of restaurant but omg the food is amazing. And the salsa  if no one was watching I would have drank it from the bowl. The margaritas went down like water  Highly recommend this place  you won t be disappointed 
El Michoacano Mexican Restaurant,9,My sister has been telling me for years that I had to eat at El Michoacano the second I get into Austin from Denver. Since we traveled toget5her this time  we stopped.  twice . First for lunch and breakfast on the way home. And she bought two dozen tortillas to take home which in hindsight was a bad idea as they don t do well in security.   She had a combo platter and I had a carne asada taco for lunch and breakfast was the best breakfast taco. And at breakfast we were joined by two more siblings who are local to Austin and had never eaten there. I think we have some new regulars.  Our waitress was the owners daughter and she was so nice telling us her favorites and family history. They have been opened for 22 years and I think that says it all.
El Michoacano Mexican Restaurant,10,Don t let looks deceive you.... This place is amazing. From the outside the building looks like it has been abandoned for years  however  on the inside this place is a restaurant. The staff was extremely friendly. The inside was definitely a typical authentic Mexican food place. If you are expecting fancy dinning or beautiful ambiance  then this is not the place for you. If you are looking for great food  though  this is your place  I will definitely be back for more.
El Michoacano Mexican Restaurant,11,For the best Menudo  we are willing to drive 30 minutes. Staff is very friendly and   the taco s memorable
El Michoacano Mexican Restaurant,12,Walked in around 8 30 had a couple beers and ate the  House Specialty  Enchiladas Mexicana. One of the best plates I ve ever had. So good I came back to the hotel and wrote this review my first . Service was great and the waitress said they ve been open for almost 25 years. I ll be going back.
El Michoacano Mexican Restaurant,13,Absolutely legit Mexican food. Better yet - we are two peeps originally from SO CAL. We know food.  We were stranded in Austin TX thanks to United Airlines. They put us up at a dumpster of hotel Quality Inn. This place made sleeping on top of the sheets worth it  DON T miss out on this gem  We had shared a 3 tacos combo and I ordered a side a flour tortillas to die for  The service was amazingly friendly as were are total grinos 
El Michoacano Mexican Restaurant,14,You need to know the menu to know what to order....I guess. I had the huevos rancheros plate. If you told me they opened canned beans and a bag of potatoes I wouldn t be surprised. Waited an hour for my food to be room temperature. I am giving it a star because of the tortillas and the horchata were pretty good. My boyfriend had Migas and wasn t pleased with it as well. Not worth  30 and an hour wait. Don t waste your time.
El Michoacano Mexican Restaurant,15,Since I ve been here in TX I ve had the pleasure of getting my fill of tacos. I love tacos  My boss brought me in a couple of breakfast tacos from here  and I must say they were so delicious. The tortillas were soft  and so fresh. The hot sauce which I believe to be one of the most important ingredients to a great taco was fresh  amp  had the perfect amount of heat. It s going to be hard to leave TX with all this good food . Seriously TX is like foodie paradise. This is a great place for a quick bite .
El Michoacano Mexican Restaurant,16,Very poor quality Mexico City style food.   Tortillas crumbly  too thin and under cooked.  Service was spotty  staff watching tv rather than tables.  Shredded chicken tacos included shredded bone splinters.   Beef taco was course grounds of beef  not much larger than ground pepper.   Likely due to fatty content  very oily.  Corn tortillas crumbled  but flour tortilla was adequate.  Margaritas were syrup flavored without much tequila flavor...not worth the price and we weren t notified about happy hour pricing  but we just wanted to flee the joint.
El Michoacano Mexican Restaurant,17,  81 Well...To start this experience off...NO Queso...on a Saturday ..Wife was ready to leave that very second...would a 1 star from here if she was writing the review...I mean That is part of the whole experience on our quest to 100 different mexican texmex joints...As for the food...wasn t bad...Salsa was spicy  chips crisp..Wife went the usual route beef Chiladas and rice...best part was the guajillo sauce...meat by itself  not much flavor...but all together...pretty good...mine was the Chicken Chiladas with the suiza sauce..was OK   bit much sour cream flavor  and a bit on the thick side...Not the  Suiza  Im used to..Rice and Beans were standard fair...not much stood out..service was good...chances we would come back....No Queso..No Bueno   
El Michoacano Mexican Restaurant,18,The food is so good and the salsa is fresh the best salsa I ve had. I would recommend this place   A great hole in the wall 
El Michoacano Mexican Restaurant,19,Still fine but not what it was on our first visit. Food came out quicker which may have been the issue. Chips and salsa good as ever.
El Michoacano Mexican Restaurant,20,Authentic Mexican food.  Corn Tortillas were home made  not store bought.  Chicken fajitas were tender and excellent.
El Michoacano Mexican Restaurant,21,Just came back from a weekend trip to NY and we were really craving some REAL tacos. Picked this little gem up on the maps and wow  More delicious than anticipated  homemade tortillas here are great
El Michoacano Mexican Restaurant,22,A morning I was in a rush to work and happened to forget my lunch at home. I ran into this restaurant and ended up having one of the best breakfast tacos. Whether corn or flour they are hand made and are delicious.
El Michoacano Mexican Restaurant,23,If you are a vegetarian there are so many other places in Austin to go. I advise checking out a different place. If you don t have dietary restrictions then this place is great   I was invited out to lunch after a big meeting and they wanted to go here because it was close. I don t live in Austin so I just went with the crowd. Unfortunately this place had no idea why I wouldn t want to eat meat or eat beans that were cooked in lard.   When I first walked in everyone was already sitting at a table so I joined in. There wasn t a large table - just a bunch of tables shoved together so we could all fit. No problems with that. The issue was that some of the tables were different sizes and heights and they wobbles and I was worried that my food would fall into my lap.   The salsa was spicy and amazing on the chips   The waitresses were very nice. They brought the drinks out quickly but I did not see a menu so when she asked what I wanted I jumped to my go-to for mexican restaurants. Veggie Fajitas. She was so confused. She asked  You mean beef fajitas   and I replied with  yes  Beef fajitas with no beef  and she stood around so confused. I then asked if they would be able to do that  Can you grill vegetables - peppers  onions  tomatoes  whatever without meat   and she smiled and said she would check. She asked if I wanted beans and I asked if they were cooked in lard. She said yes so I politely declined.   When the food came out the plate was full of grilled peppers and onions so I was happy. Plus I had some yummy rice with guacamole. The tortillas are hand made and tastes sooooo good  I love hand made flour tortillas. I am pretty sure they grilled the vegetables on the grill where meat had been used previously. They tasted a little .... greasy and it definitely upset my stomach.  I would recommend this place to anyone who loved authentic Mexican food but not if you are vegetarian 
El Michoacano Mexican Restaurant,24,This was a very nice surprise to find this place. For a very reasonable price I had a very nice dinner. They have house special enchiladas with meat  I chose quail  with awesome spices. Really appreciated that place.
El Michoacano Mexican Restaurant,25,This place is home of the most legit interior Mexican food in Austin. This was our third visit and worth the mention. The service is efficient  the salsa has the perfect amount of heat and the entrees did not disappoint. Close to the airport if you re just passing through or worth the short drive from central Austin.
El Michoacano Mexican Restaurant,26,I highly recommend El Michoac no to anyone who appreciates excellent homemade family Mexican food... gave it a shot as I didn t really want to have dinner at the Airport... awesome Chile Relleno with fresh Corn Tortillas  Rice Beans  amp  Guacamole... service was great and very friendly... the restaurant itself is pretty old and rundown but I could care less once seated and eating...  - 
El Michoacano Mexican Restaurant,27,This place brought back memories of what good....real Mexican food taste like....this is not TexMex   Great family owed and family run...business   Definitely coming back 
El Michoacano Mexican Restaurant,28,Just finished one of the best Mexican meals of my life.  It was crazy good.  The salsa was amazing  the tortillas too.  Highly recommend the lemonade.  Fresh made and pulpy.   I come to Austin for work quite a bit  and always stay at the hotel right down the street.  Not sure why I never came here before  but I will be back..... Tomorrow...... And probably the next day.
El Michoacano Mexican Restaurant,29,This was awesome Mexican. Cheap  delicious  and fast. Been there twice and I can t wait to get back to Austin to go a third time.
El Michoacano Mexican Restaurant,30,Really recommend it. Really delicious food   Had some porch chops in ranchero sauce really good u have to try it.
El Michoacano Mexican Restaurant,31,Me and my husband love this place  We usually stop by in the mornings. All their food is homemade you won t be disappointed. Their drinks are homemade as well lemonade is my favorite. I would recommend you try this place out for sure. Liz is great she is always smiling and treats her customers great.
El Michoacano Mexican Restaurant,32,Growing up in Corpus Christi I have been exposed to quality Mexican food. This place is legit. Delicious home made tortillas   the corn are especially tasty. The staff is attentive and swift. Nothing fancy  but plenty of tables so rarely a wait. Right by the airport. It has been in business for 20 years  and it is obvious why. Definitely recommend if you re out this way.
El Michoacano Mexican Restaurant,33,Homemade tortillas homemade tortillas homemade tortillas     I travel up and down 71east quite often and i always  wondered what that orange looking building was. So one Saturday morning i pulled over and ordered some breakfast tacos and i must say they were yummy for my tummy.  I m going  on a regular basis. HOMEMADE TORTILLAS     
El Michoacano Mexican Restaurant,34,El Michoacano serves tasty cheap Tex Mex. Homemade tortillas are used to make great tacos. The salsa is good.Mexican coke is available. Great lunch specials. A killer Mexican juke box.  For breakfast or lunch near the airport this was one of my spots. When you find out your best girl is doing your best friend she is no longer your best girl.    The problem is lard. Lard has always been a part of Tex Mex cooking.In the old days people bought fresh lard or made it from pork fat. Today the hydrogenated lard containing trans fats is common in Tex Mex. El Michoacano  uses the cheap trans fat lard. Sold in large tubs it will last forever. After Texas is destroyed in a nuclear war you find only cockroaches feasting on hydrogenated lard. Lard may be an important part of Tex Mex. So if you want to eat lard make it the fresh kind.
El Michoacano Mexican Restaurant,35,Absolutely love their Mexican style enchiladas but can t say the same for the service. When we arrived the staff was seated at a table near the entrance I m assuming because they didn t have any tables at the time. We were then told to seat ourselves and then proceeded to wait about 5 minutes before finally having anyone come bring us the menus and get a drink order. Food came out in a decent amount of time but was just dropped off without asking if we needed anything else like a refill  utensils  etc. I had to get up various time to ask for things like napkins or refill for our table and every time I d find our waitress sitting on her phone. I did notice when a table of about three guys came in she became more attentive to their table so not sure if we were receiving bad service because we weren t guys or she just didn t like us. I am a waitress as well so I understand not wanting to check on customers every couple minutes or taking a small break but this staff lacked customer service completely.
El Michoacano Mexican Restaurant,36,Really bad service and the food was even worse.  Couldn t even eat the fajitas they were so dry and the carnitas were absolutely disgusting. It was mostly pieces of slimy pig skin.  The flour tortillas and chips were really good but everything else was so bad it was left on the plate. I can t imagine why anyone would say this was authentic Mexican food. I happen to have many relatives there and have eaten in Mexico more times then I can count and have never been served such horrible food. I guess maybe we ordered the wrong thing but I would steer clear of this place.  I guess they make good breakfast tacos but news flash they don t make those in Mexico. Paid 35 dollars for food we couldn t eat just because we didn t want to get beaten up if we didn t pay.  Was looking for real Mexican food in Texas but didn t find it here.
El Michoacano Mexican Restaurant,37,Oh boy  Teacher work day  We get to go out to eat like real grown-ups  The only problem with working way out here is...where the heck do we go   El Michoacano fits the bill for very tasty tex-mex in this culinary twilight zone around the airport. As an employee in the Del Valle ISD  I know how hard it is to find good eats around here. And what s up with that  developers  Hardly any place to eat around our airport  Hmmm.  Our  fab  principal picks up big  yummy breakfast tacos for our faculty meetings  every combo imaginable  best homemade flour tortillas in Austin  excellent salsa so hot it makes me sweat. Perfect  in other words. Fresh  crisp chips that taste homemade  too. Very little English spoken  which is always a good sign  divey atmosphere complete with a spanish-only jukebox  spanish language newspapers  a small kitchen and a friendly staff.  I ve had the enchiladas  creamy  gooey goodness   sampled lots of breakfast tacos  and that s about it. They have your typical tex-mex variety of food  four caldos  entrees inlcuding puerco en salsa rojo verde  seafood dishes  barbacoa and the like...all very reasonably priced. The only thing they don t have is a website.  Give  em a try sometime when you re out this way...
El Michoacano Mexican Restaurant,38,I stopped by to pickup lunch and was surprised to pay 13.99 for Mexican enchiladas plate from a restaurant that is literally a hole in the wall  to not say ugly  dirty looking . I was optimistic that maybe the price was due to great quality food. I got to my office to my surprise the Mexican enchiladas have NO CHEESE   upset because not I m at work and I knew I had ordered cheese enchiladas due to Good Friday. I called and the lady that answered the phone stated it was not a mistake the enchiladas had no cheese they make them with grated parmesan   i followed up with saying I had initially asked for cheese enchiladas and she sarcastically stated parmesan cheese is cheese. It made sense why the room smelled like pizza when I opened the plate. No solution was offered   even tho I stated how can a 13.99 dollar plate of cheese enchiladas be made with sprinkles of parmesan cheese    I stated I would just never give them business again. NOT EVEN MY DOG WOULD EAT THE TORTILLAS STUFFED WITH ONIONS SPRINKLED WITH OFF BRAND parmesan Cheese out of a plastic container.
El Michoacano Mexican Restaurant,39,There are two things you need to try here    the flour tortillas - homemade and yum  any taco here is pretty tasty because of the flour tortillas.  i especially like the chorizo and egg breakfast tacos.   the chile relleno   it s probably the best chile rellno I ve had in Austin or the surrounding area - fluffy  eggy batter deliciousness.    avoid the front room  it is not air conditioned well at all.  avoid the queso   it is just horrible  watery and strange.    you might get an authentic waitress that doesn t speak english  so brush up on your basic ordering skills en espanol.
El Michoacano Mexican Restaurant,40,Came here for dinner while on vacation. My husband ordered the chile verde  my daughter the enfrijoladas and I the menudo. My family was happy with their food but the menudo was a bit spicy for me.  The homemade tortillas were delicious as well as the horchata. They don t serve dessert which is a bummer for me.  Overall friendly staff and good service.
El Michoacano Mexican Restaurant,41,I was dropping my man off at the airport for a work trip and since we were early  we decided to stop somewhere close to the airport to grab a beer and a snack.   This place is pretty authentic  but very run down.  It s very small on the inside and pretty ghetto looking - on both the outside and the inside.  We had a couple of modelos and split some tacos.  The tacos were tasty  but the shells looked like they were from the Old El Paso taco kit.  The chips and salsa were decent - the salsa had a kick to it which I liked.   There was a whole back room that was filled with Christmas stuff that the restaurant could visibly see  which I thought was hysterical.   Not a terrible place to grab a snack and a beverage.  I certainly wouldn t take a 1st date here  but overall  not too shabby for a quick stop.
El Michoacano Mexican Restaurant,42,It looks a bit dodgy from the outside  but the food and service is very very good. I had the Caldo de Pollo and it was absolutely delicious. I d come back here for sure. It s a great place for staging for the airport.
El Michoacano Mexican Restaurant,43,Ham  egg  cheese breakfast tacos. Homemade tortillas. Good ham. Bright yellow cheese. Good  but highly variable salsa. Being a little lightheaded from soccer helps with the whole experience.  Convenient to South East Metro Park sports fields  amp  airport   It does sometimes smell like a sewer outside. We call it  stinky taco  for short  El Michoacano is a mouthful.
El Michoacano Mexican Restaurant,44,Was just here on 19 Feb before flying back home. My BFF and I grabbed a few cold Dos Equis and breakfast.  It is not a great looking establishment - in or out - but it is directly across from the airport and the service was very good.  We were attended to frequently enough  with warm smiles and care regarding our food  amp  beverage emjoyment.  The menu is entirely authentic Mexican  so if you are looking for  Chili s   Blech  what s wrong with you    then this is not your place. I think we were the only two people in the place who needed to look at the menu to know what they offered  and we were the only non-Spanish speakers  sorry  BFF  I know you ve had classes  but you still don t speak Spanish very well...YET   but it didn t matter as we were treated with equally good service.  Its a simple place with good food and great service.  Oh and the beer is nice and cold  even on Sunday mornings.  A GREAT alternative to eating inside the airport before you catch a flight  and by the way  the airport doesn t serve any beer until after 12 noon on Sundays  so there you go... .
El Michoacano Mexican Restaurant,45,This restaurant is located near the Austin airport  and is fairly easy to access.  I ve only been there for breakfast.  Their breakfast tacos are excellent  specifically because their tortillas are homemade and delicious.  Don t worry if the outside smells a little stinky.  The inside is fine.
El Michoacano Mexican Restaurant,46,Service has improved greatly   Love the staff  The location is perfect in my commute.
El Michoacano Mexican Restaurant,47,Kind of terrible breakfast tacos but a decent lunch. Slow cooks. Nothing really to brag about at all.
El Michoacano Mexican Restaurant,48,Everything here tastes homemade like my grandma s are in the kitchen cooking. I love the food from here and i love how its so close to my house    It can be busy at times but you just have to know when to get there.
El Michoacano Mexican Restaurant,49,Amazing carnitas.  Their name says it all. Original region of pork carnitas. Traditionally served with onions  cilantro  jalape os  re fried beans and rice. Fresh made corn tortillas. Amazing food. Short  sorta sketchy walk from quality inn along highway. Standard margarita in big plastic glass with salt. Very nice server.
El Michoacano Mexican Restaurant,50,Great Mexican food. This is as authentic as you can get. Enchiladas are really good here and the red sauce that comes with it is mmmmm.
El Michoacano Mexican Restaurant,51,I have to say is is most authentic Mexican place I ve been to in Austin. The flautas are amazing    
El Michoacano Mexican Restaurant,52,Just like you ve crossed the border and parked in a small town cantina lot and stepped into Momma s for a meal. You wouldn t complain about the building condition and cleanliness in that environment-think of this place that way and all is good. Best Tex-Mex   Fresh tortillas  good red sauce on the enchiladas and the tamales are yum. Daily lunch specials are reasonably priced as are the other menu items.  It is all the other things folks commented about  so if you re a germy germ type  go to Taco Bell.  If you want authentic Mex  give it a try.
El Michoacano Mexican Restaurant,53,This place is expensive . And the older guy with the glasses at the register is a grouch. I ordered some flautas  and what I got were three soggy tortillas with chicken and cheese . I also had to pick between getting rice and guacamole   or rice and beans. I work at the airport across the way and I am always looking for new spots for lunch and this won t be one. Nine dollars can buy me some good ole airport food.
El Michoacano Mexican Restaurant,54,Rate it a 2 .Ordered the chicken Flautas . They weren t the way I m used to   but tasted decent plus had cheese in the middle which was a good twist . Inside not the nicest   cleanest place   but I m used to that . The service though  had two waitresses come to me . One was friendly and the other not . The non-friendly one was the one who checked me out and didn t even acknowledge me . She was deep into a conversation with some guy next to her and cashed me out and that was it . No have a nice day nothing . So customer service no good in my eyes plus mediocre food  not a great place .
El Michoacano Mexican Restaurant,55,Don t pass this place by. Most authentic Mexican food I ve had in Austin. I had the enchiladas with green chile sauce. Spicy and delicious. It s like a family kitchen not a chain feel. Don t miss out  And it won t break the bank.
El Michoacano Mexican Restaurant,56,The food is really good and cheap.  I used to eat there once or twice a week for 2 yers.  Rated a one for cleanliness.  Last time I ate there  cockroaches came crawling out of the leaf of the table.  Turned me off for good.
El Michoacano Mexican Restaurant,57,This place is a dive. Ugly and gross looking. But  don t let it fool you. Some of the best Mexican food in this area. Breakfast tacos are fantastic. The enchiladas are hardy.
El Michoacano Mexican Restaurant,58,some of the best tex mex in Austin ...get here get in and enjoy .....had the taco plate chicken and beef. very good.
El Michoacano Mexican Restaurant,59,OMG      We got stranded in the airport for about 5 hours  and didn t feel like eating at the airport  so the only place we found was this mom and pop restaurant. At first  we were hesitant but always up for trying new things. Never will I regret it  best mexican food  we have ever tasted. We went on a Sunday Morning  which they were very busy but the staff was very friendly  Definitely going back and will recommend it to everyone. Really YUMMY   
El Michoacano Mexican Restaurant,60,Really good red pepper sauce  the best Carne Guisada I have had.  The Chile Relleno is damn good too.  Kind of a hole in the wall place  so don t let the crappy  dirty  run-down feel of the place get to you before you try the food.  Service is so-so  but the food outweighs any negatives.
La Cathedral Del Marisco,1,Waiter provided us such good service. The food and timing was all great and we had a blast  Would recommend for anyone who enjoys large servings and legitimate mexican food
La Cathedral Del Marisco,2,A K A  La Capital de Marisco  First off  this ain t Fonda San Miguel  Guero s  nor Chuy s. It s Mexican-owned and -operated. The woman who owns it and cooks there  not the only cook there  though  had had a restaurant in Mexico  and these are her recipes from there. This style of Mexican food originates from Bejucos  a village inland from Acapulco - hence the emphasis on mariscos  seafood . Everyone who works there is Mexican  and one of them told me the food tastes as authentic as locally-available ingredients will allow.  The first time I ate here  about three years ago  it was on a Thursday  when the lunch special is chicken enchiladas with green sauce. The enchiladas were surprisingly delicious  and the rice perfectly-cooked.  I later learned that the chicken is marinaded in spices  not just tossed-in.  That green salsa  mind-blowingly sabroso. For about an hour after I left  the food was still making me feel like crying  it was that good. I eat here almost weekly  and usually leave repeatedly exclaiming to myself   That food was so GOOD   Once  just after I d devoured my meal  still at the table  I did start to cry. I couldn t help it  I love the food here.  Thus far  I ve had the  green enchiladas   the fajita chicken plate  the shrimp fish soup  the fish platter  both shrimp and fish tacos  the carne asada with nopales  the chicken enchiladas with yellow cheese combo platter  the shrimp enchiladas  and the mole enchiladas. Some I prefer over others  though they re all great  but that has to be the best mole sauce that I ll ever have. Their corn tortillas are handmade  yummy by themselves.  Add to this that the waitresses are really nice  and the murals on the walls are whimsical. I also love the food at Chapala and Las Cazuelas  to the west on Cesar Chavez  and Arandas and Polvo s on South First  but whenever I eat at another Mexican restaurant  I wish that I d eaten here.  Bonus  the Guerrero taco trailer  around the corner on Pleasant Valley Rd.  is primo. That carnitas taco - dang 
La Cathedral Del Marisco,3,Servers were so mamonas . Literally took 10 minutes for an extra plate   Ya pa que      Oysters tasted like sink water ...  boooo
La Cathedral Del Marisco,4,Today s visit was a little off. We ordered Caldo de Res beef soup  and 2 al pastor tacos. The tacos arrived but not the soup. We asked about the soup and they said we never ordered it. It took another 20 min for the soup.  Food today was also just average. Missing the flavor we usually experience.
La Cathedral Del Marisco,5,Do not eat at this restaurant unless you want to get sick then by all means go ahead   they have flies Everywhere the restroom stinks like a Port-a potty s stay away from this restaurant at all cost I paid  35 to get sick violently sick within an minutes of eating there take my word for it do not eat there. I repeat do not eat there . Just stay away . save your money. There are way better sea food Restaurants . I suggest going to deckhands they re way better and worth every penny
La Cathedral Del Marisco,6,YUM. I just got two tostadas  one shrimp  one octopus. Tons of perfectly cooked seafood on top of a crispy and delicious tostada with generous slices of fresh  ripe avocado on top. My husband got some grilled fish  and it came with handmade  thick  warm  corn tortillas. Amazing deal  preparation  flavor.
La Cathedral Del Marisco,7,I hope La Catedral de Marisco  1 never closes. The cook at this location is so amazing.  Perfectly made rice  beans  strip steak made to perfection.  Fresh and homemade tortillas.  It s my top three best Mexican food in central Austin.
La Cathedral Del Marisco,8,Come here if you like authentic Mexican food. I had the  7 mares soup   or something like that  and it was extremely good. The soup came with shrimp  crab  clams   and a bunch of other delicious seafood and the broth was to die for 
La Cathedral Del Marisco,9,Good food portions and I love this place  Its like a hidden gem... but the last time I had came was sad.   The sever got pissy when we asked for flour tortillas and she brought us corn then when we asked her then the mood was ugly .. She kept forgetting our straws and refills and severed some foreigners way better and faster with no flawless mistakes
La Cathedral Del Marisco,10,Visting Austin we wanted to try something new.  I found this place and was glad I did.  The food is great  chips and salsa are good and the Michelada was awesome.  Our waitress was attentive and made suggestions.
La Hacienda Market,1,The other reviews are mostly about the food counter.  I have never eaten at the food counter but I go to La Hacienda regularly for a few things   1  The red ribs  aka las costilla marinadas.  These are mind-blowing.  The marinade -which inevitably stains your fingers through the next morning- is made out of beer  pineapple  and other secret things and the ribs are cut across the bone much like Korean style beef ribs.  They have several other meat products behind the counter with the same marinade but the ribs win  hands down.  I have never met a person who didn t like these.  In fact  these are so good that I didn t even tell people where to buy them until a couple years ago.  Don t tell anyone else  okay   It s our little secret.  2  Salsa verde  aka  TacoDeli s Do a salsa  but BETTER because it s not a stupid Tex-Mex chain s  or HEB s  appropriation of a very common Mexican salsa.  This is made out of jalape os  oil and garlic  and it is not for the faint of heart.  Although really  why mild salsa is even an option irks me.  But this green stuff... ohhhh it s good.  We put it on EVERYTHING  from chips and tacos to eggs and brisket sandwiches.  You might just lick the container.  And if it s gone  it s in the refrigerated section across from the eggs  you can always get some from the food counter.  Grab some El Milagro chips on your way out and you can snack on the drive home  because just dunking your fingers in it and licking would be uncouth .  3  Tamales - I think these are seasonal but I m not sure exactly what the season is.  I just know if they have them  I buy them.  They have the more common corn husk variety as well as the extra delicious style wrapped in banana leaves.   4  Mexican spices - big variety.  5  Cheap pi atas.  Like crazy cheap.  Not as huge a selection as the pi ata places on Cesar Chavez  but they ll do in a pinch.  There s a much bigger  much crazier Mexican grocery store across 183 that seems to have cut down on La Hacienda s business  but the ribs and salsa are far superior at LH.
La Hacienda Market,2,Excellent menudo Saturday morning. Good carnitas with hand made tortillas. You have to come inside the store and order at the checkout counter. Then proceed to the back of the store. The setting is very minimalist with a counter top like a sushi bar. Good authentic tacos.
La Hacienda Market,3,The little things count  I stop by on a Saturday craving tamales de elote  huchepos  I got 4 from the hot counter I went home to eat them for lunch but they were horrible  dry and hard I couldn t event cut them with a knife is and insult to the clients to sale food that is un edible     
La Hacienda Market,4,Love this place. I work close by. Visit this location for lunch twice a wk. Fresh food and cooked just right. Friendly staff. Only thing I wished was the majority of the staff spoke English. But by no means is it an issue  besides its a Mexican store... I ll make the adjustment. The customer service and patience of the employees make the experience GOOD  Will recommend to anyone.
La Hacienda Market,5,The hot food counter is awesome. The only thing it s missing is fresh hot tortillas. I saw them pulling the tortillas out of a bag. Sad thing is  I saw a cooler with fresh hot tortillas from a bakery down the street  why couldn t you have used those  I d have loved you even more.  I tried the borrego  pastor  barbacoa  y lengua tacos. The borrego was really good. The meat didn t have too strong of a lamb flavor and I like that in my lamb. It was greasy but I can deal. The pastor seasonings were phenomenal. It had a bit of spice  with a lot of flavor. The barbacoa was super juicy and beyond tender. I wanted more of that greasy  heart stopping goodness. The lengua was chewy and tasty  but I did need some of their salsa verde to complete the taco. I added onions and cilantro to all my tacos. I topped the meal off with some orchata  spelling . MMM. Tasty meal that made me slightly sleepy at work.  I had coworkers try the pork with tomatillo salsa and saiid that it as good as well. I want more. To be continued....
La Hacienda Market,6,Great little tacos   While this place is definitely more of a grocery market  they have a food counter with an awesome selection of taco options. The cooked meats are on display so you can get a good look at what you re gonna get. I think you can get the meats by the pound as well - which is pretty cool.  Important note - you order food at the regular grocery checkout and then give the ticket to the nice ladies behind the food counter.  They have about 10 stools if you want to eat right at the counter  otherwise it s to-go.  I tried beef fajita and chicken tacos on my visit. The taco tortillas  flour   I got were a touch on the small side  but they piled them up with meat. They added cilantro and onions - which is such a simple thing  but it puts them right up there with other authentic mexican tacos I ve tried. The beef was very tasty and not very fatty. The chicken was fantastic with a very tasty sauce  in the deli display you could see the chicken swimming in the red sauce with chunks of peppers and onions .  They had a great verde salsa in squeeze bottles on the counter. Not as awesome as El Regio s  but close.  There is no Menu  and the ladies at the food counter didn t speak much english  so either brush up on your spanish or know what you want before you order.  The back part of the store is the meat market. It looks very well stocked and they even had a big case of seemingly fresh chicharones.  I think I m going to need to hit these folks up for taco fixings by the pound next time.
La Hacienda Market,7,The stars remain the same  but I m slightly disappointed with their hot food counter. I ve been on my Great Torta Quest for a while now  and I finally noticed that they have chicken tortas here.   The main impetus for this is that practically every time I ve been here recently  they re out of tamales. I ve been wanting to try their Tamales Veracruzanos  but this time I went for the torta.   There are two types of torta bread. This is the more popular kind  given my experience   but not what my El Paso cohorts would call the  correct  kind. This kind has to either be toasted really really well  or you will just have a really supremely messy torta experience. Which I had.   The good   They put beans on their torta. They give you a side of their awesome green salsa and some limes. They use stewed chicken instead of chicken fajita They put crema on their torta.  The not-so-good  Messy Messy torta experience due to bread falling apart. No avocados  Srsly   I asked  and the lady said they didn t have any. huh  Stewed chicken had more than a couple bites of chicken parts I d rather not eat.   So  I ll be sticking to their tamales  and maybe try something else in the future  but these tortas don t measure up to Matamoros.
La Hacienda Market,8,I saw this meat market on my way to work one day and I figured I d go in and check it out. I love places where you can get fresh meats produce.  Ok  so I am hispanic....I walk in and everyone stops and stares. Great...I immediately feel out of place. Why  Who the heck knows  Instead of walking out  I grab a cart and push away.  I will NOT be intimidated by the stares.  So  I peruse the aisles in hopes of finding something I can t live without.   The place is decent. They have a nice selection of meats and regular grocery products. However  the aisles are so dang cramped together.  I hate feeling as if I can t breathe or as if the guy next to you will have to rub against you to push his way through the same aisle. ICK  Anyway  I guess this place is ok. I just wish people wouldn t stare at you as if they ve never seen a Hispanic who is native Texan instead of from the heart of Mexico.  I still love to eat  too   I walked out with some cucumbers and a few canned goods. I don t think I ll be back unless I m feeling ornery.
De La O Kitchen,1,Amazing tortas and sauces. I am sad they have moved to Dripping Springs. For those who can  please support them.
De La O Kitchen,2,Well if you crave a taco in bee caves  I would suggest to give this food truck a try. The food is fresh and flavorful. Both green and red salsa are also amazing. We usually order the veggie tacos and my wife tried their veggie burrito and till now we have liked everything.
De La O Kitchen,3,Love this place. California ex-pat and this is my favorite place for a burrito in the Lakeway Bee Cave Westlake area. Pork burrito is my favorite. Red sauce is serious stuff - be careful.
De La O Kitchen,4,Ok  if you miss street tacos from Los Angeles...come here.   If you know that a good Mexican tacos is not slathered in weird sauces and cheese...come here.   The pastor taco is delicious. Make sure you get the pineapple in it. Slightly sweet. Slightly spicy. All good.   Suadero or  rose meat  is almost like a beef carnitas. Little crunchy bits and really tasty. And yes  put the onions and cilantro on it.   The carne Asada is my third favorite. It s not bad by any means  it s really good on its own...but the two above are my favorite.   We are lucky to have this in the Bee Cave area. Compared to downtown Austin taco places...this is equal to or better.   Had the burrito once. Big and delicious. Had it with carne Asada...can t wait to do a pastor one.   Lots of outdoor seating and covered.   Super nice folks in the taco truck.   I almost did not share this because I wanted to keep it to myself.   Enjoy.
De La O Kitchen,5,These are the best tacos I ve had  and I ve been searching  a lot  since moving to Austin from Southern CA 8 weeks ago.  Pastor is great with fresh pineapple grilled in and the Suadero is fantastic too.  Look forward to trying the full menu.  Large portions and great prices.  What a great find a few minutes from home 
De La O Kitchen,6,I needed breakfast tacos for my kiddos morning birthday party and tried De La O. I called the day before and was able to order 2dozen tacos to be picked up the next morning. They even opened early for us  The owners were so sweet  And the tacos were amazingggggg. Seriously these are the best tacos I ve found in the bee cave area. Do not pass them up. I can t wait to go back and try their lunch tacos and tortas 
De La O Kitchen,7,Went here for lunch today because the lines at Chick Fila across the street were long  amp  I m so glad that I did. I had a burrito  amp  my daughter had tacos  they are so good that I m worried about other people finding out  amp  causing me to wait in line forever  I m thinking this is the most authentic take out Mexican food in our neighborhood. Highly recommended  
De La O Kitchen,8,One of the authentic  delicious tacos we had. Their tacos are cheap but it doesn t affect the quality of their food.
De La O Kitchen,9,Finally    A legit taco truck in Lakeway   This place checks just about all of the boxes.  Sampled the breakfast tacos  heuevos mexicana  bean and cheese  bacon and egg  and a Carne Asada taco today and they were all outstanding.  Big thumbs up for the grilled onions and serranos with the Carne Asada.  Salsas are outstanding - especially the jalape o salsa.  Cant wait to go back and try their tortas and al pastor tacos.  Would love to see them add sopes and gorditas  but even without them  this fills a much needed void in Lakeway  and will be getting lots of my business.  Clean  friendly  looks to be a family operation.  So happy to have them here  especially after the apparent demise of Little DF in Spicewood.  Welcome to Lakeway De La O - I hope you stick around for a long time 
De La O Kitchen,10,Me and a friend decided to give these guys a try recently. We made a huge mistake... by not coming here sooner. I have been going everyday now. Well this morning i tweaked my back but decided i still had to go.  Called from my car and said i tweaked my back if i could order from my car right outside and pick up. The young lady was like if u have exact change i ll bring it out to you. What an awesome gesture and I did have exact change... i wish i had another  5 to tip for that. I told her i d be back next time with a bigger tip. Man i wish ppl like her realized that all you have to do is be nice to people. It goes a long way. Made my day with a messed up back 
De La O Kitchen,11,I work in the area and have been looking for a good taco place for breakfast or lunch. While trying many gas stations tacos  that were overpriced and underfilled. I drove by this lot and saw a small turquoise food truck that read out  Mexican Tacos  on the side. I was already expecting to be disappointed but as i walked up and saw a line of people waiting for their food  I became a little hopeful. I placed my order  3 tacos  thinking that they would be small. When I received my order ans felt the heat and the weight of the bag  I knew i had finally found my breakfast lunch spot.    Big  cheap  and delicous. Reminds me of San Antonio tacos.
De La O Kitchen,12,Came here today and am so happy to have a great taco truck nearby  We got 4 carne asada tacos  they come topped with cilantro and onions  as well as a side of grilled onions and a grilled Serrano pepper. The red salsa is spicy and delicious  It also comes with a green salsa. Will definitely be back. Great prices and great food 
De La O Kitchen,13,Hands down the best breakfast tacos  in the area.  Try it for yourself and you won t be disappointed.  Friendly owners and service with a smile
De La O Kitchen,14,All the tacos here are delicious  especially their egg and chorizo and al pastor.
De La O Kitchen,15,Amazing tacos   Their salsas are incredible   My breakfast taco go to place and they are so nice.
De La O Kitchen,16,By far the best breakfast tacos I ve ever had  I don t know how they do it but they are truly amazing. My go to is potato egg and cheese  Highly recommend
De La O Kitchen,17,Excellent breakfast tacos at a  reasonable price. Support local  businesses    I can t wait to go there for lunch and try their tortas 
De La O Kitchen,18,Dropped by for some breakfast tacos.  Pretty damn good   Not greasy.  Very flavorful.  Hot sauce has some bite   They also have corn tortillas    Thank you very much.  Finally  a place in our hood that has tacos that are worthy     very nice people  customer service is to be proud of.
De La O Kitchen,19,Best breakfast tacos I ve had in a long time. Great to finally have a place like this nearby.
De La O Kitchen,20,Very very good tacos. I eat here twice a week. Wide variety of meat to choose from. Great prices and very friendly
De La O Kitchen,21,I love this place   So happy  lucky  to have authentic tacos in Lakeway.  The people who run the truck are super nice and you can tell they care about quality and cleanliness.  I ve eaten there twice in the last week and have tried several different tacos and they were all great   The Al Pastor with pineapple  cilantro  and lime is outstanding.  The grilled serrano pepper that comes with each order is a nice touch.  Muy caliente  They serve breakfast tacos in the morning and waffles on weekend mornings.  Great...now I m hungry again...
De La O Kitchen,22,3rd time to this family owned taco truck. The carne asada is to die for. Still yummy. I must try.
Mexico Lindo and Delicious,1,Jorge is like a scientist that never grows content. Not only does he purchase what seems to be higher quality ingredients but with his ever changing menu  he produces amazing 5 star food at every stop. His food is not boring by any means and he constructs his menus like a culinary puppeteer piecing this with that to produce the tastiest of results.
Mexico Lindo and Delicious,2,This food truck came to our apartment complex today. We ordered the nachos and were deeply disappointed.  22 for two orders to get concession stand chips and cheese. The bottom was full of broken chips and the ground beef tasted cold and old. Huge chunks of cilantro and rubbery onions did nothing to improve the taste. How does a food place screw up the easiest thing to make   Definitely NOT worth the money paid for this
Mexico Lindo and Delicious,3,The Matamoros street tacos take me back to Mexico. They are so delicious and the closest to actual authentic Mexican food.
Mexico Lindo and Delicious,4,The food truck just visited my apartment complex  great and reasonably priced food  I had the chicken tinga and shredded beef tacos  both of which were delicious.
Mexico Lindo and Delicious,5,Awesome food and great peeps   I have eaten here numerous time over the last two weeks.
I Love Taco's,1,This is the best burrito I ve ever had. The guy was super friendly and nice. He could tell I was hungry and added extra chicken. The sauce is spicy and good. I highly recommend this food truck     
I Love Taco's,2,Tacos seemed like they were premade and room temp. Wrapped in foil and paper. The quesadilla was small for the price. For two orders of tacos and the quesadilla and cost about 43 . Would have been cheaper to goto cantina512 across the street and get carry out.
I Love Taco's,3,Fantastic Mexican food truck The serving guy was very nice and friendly. I tried the vegetarian tacos twice and quesadillas. The taste was very unique and flavorful. Also  It tasted fresh and had good amount of filing. I would definitely definitely recommend it for delicious Mexican food.
I Love Taco's,4,The sign says that the chicken fajita tacos come with cilantro and cheese. Wasn t either of these in my taco. I went up and asked the guy and he says to me with a straight face  I put the cheese in there  - and  I can put the cilantro if you want   - um dude it says they come with it   Oh and my tacos are covered with the sour cream that I specifically asked to leave off.   That s not my biggest complaint. My biggest complaint would be the very sparse amount of chicken in these  chicken fajitas.  They are more like a pile of lettuce with a few slivers of chicken hidden at the bottom. Pictures speak for themselves. The salsa is some gross  bright orange  bland liquid that tastes nothing like Mexican salsa.
I Love Taco's,5,Came to Rainey street for another food truck in mind  ended up being closed  so decided to eat here as second choice. That being said I didn t have too high of hopes or expectations.   I ordered the Al Pastor and my fianc  ordered the Steak Fajita Burrito with Chips  amp  Salsa. The burrito was huge and filled  closely resembles Chipotle. My two tacos seemed to have a lot of lettuce and some meat. As they were pretty tasty  I didn t receive any cheese  cilantro or tomatoes on either  which they were supposed to come with . Both orders were accompanied by two sauces  a green and red one and they were both very tasty. In fact I don t think my tacos would ve been anything good without them.   As for the  3.00 Chips and Salsa don t even waste your time. Small serving which is probably expected BUT what I wasn t expecting was the mediocre salsa. The chips came straight from a bag  amp  the salsa is PICANTE S SAUCE.
I Love Taco's,6,Nowhere near authentic  if I GPS d authentic Mexican food from this food truck it would be at least an hour drive away.  I ordered the street tacos and the chips and salsa.  For one  I couldn t figure out why they were selling the street tacos in pairs.  It was when I received my chips and salsa that I knew I had steered myself wrong.  My chips were like the gas station and ice cream truck nacho chips and the salsa was given to me in two 1 oz. containers.  My street tacos were served on flour tortillas and came with massive chunks of bell peppers in them. Also  my water bottle was room temperature at best. The best thing about my meal was the tiny bit of salsa I received  though I m sure it was store bought.  I feel utterly disrespected and can t figure out for the life of me what tasteless sub-humans are keeping this place in business.  Never again 
I Love Taco's,7,Chicken fajita tacos  chicken burrito and veggie tacos  all were pleased. Asked for a spoon or a fork  got a spork. Win-win.
I Love Taco's,8,Amazing food truck  The vegetarian tacos were my absolute favorite and the al pastor were my boyfriend s  1 choice. Super nice and great service   Absolutely one of my favorite taco trucks in Austin- will be back
Jack in the Box,1,I m here a lot  mainly because I m nearby a lot. It s a Jack  and it s a bit of a ghetto Jack. But in general the staff are friendly and responsive.  Five stars for location. Four stars for service. Two stars for food. It s a Jack.
Jack in the Box,2,This place on riverside is horrible  I gave them 3 chances  that s fair right    Let s start  number 1 they cancelled my online order and when I got there SHE said  oh did you have an order   Yes... can I have my order   No  we never got your order and we re not taking orders anymore tonight.  Ok  I left peacefully. I asked for a refund but never got it.   I figured it was a fluke  my husband and I love Jack We waited a week and thought  let s try again   My husband walked up and once again they said  oh we never got your order    He asked if we could get reimbursed for our online order and they said  no sir     At this point all I want is a Baconator and I don t know how to to get it   I m reaching out to you for help
Jack in the Box,3,With this Jack n The Box it s always a hit or a miss sometimes you get in and out and other times you could be in line for up to an hour. Now On this trip I have no complaining my food was hot and fresh and I was in line for about 7 minutes.
Jack in the Box,4,I pulled Up to the drive-through on my lunch break sit at the microphone for a few minutes nobody answered I was saying hello no answer no response pulled up to the window no one at the window no one inside caught three or four times with no answer I m not sure if what s going on
Jack in the Box,5,Don t go at 9 00 PM--old  dried out jalapeno poppers--out of eggrolls. Don t seem to care.  Just want folks in and OUT--Gave me fries  thinking that would appease me--UGH.  Never will darken their door again   Shoulda  bought frozen   CP
Jack in the Box,6,Whoever was working the drive through on Saturday 10 30 was easily the most charming and kind drive through employee I ve ever encountered. Give her a raise 
Jack in the Box,7,I have to keep writing on this place. I get it  it s fast food. Who cares  When you re in the mood and this is what comes at you late and you don t see it until you re home drunk craving that box. Pass.
Jack in the Box,8,Now I believe the food was tampered with because of the comment the dude at the drive through  window made to me. I enjoy the food as he laughed. Health Dept should investigate this restaurant.
Jack in the Box,9,You guessed it back at you with another one star review because they keep emailing me from the block list of exactly sure how they re doing that I hope this is long enough to be posted as a review and narrative stop emailing me nationwide one star reviews nationwide suck at corporate
Jack in the Box,10,Just had a  28 and the service was outstanding  Shout out to the lady at the drive thru I really appreciate a friendly and fun employee  Thanks lady 
Jack in the Box,11,The location known for selling crack from the store and having prostitutes in the parking lot  now has a homeless camp with bicycle parts.  They really just don t care at all.
Jack in the Box,12,This place just got raided 3 employees selling crack cocaine out of the establishment. They are still trying to recover as it took 20 mins to get through the drive threw And weird but this time around they handed me the card system and made me insert the chip myself. Thought that was odd. The food was actually fresh for once  Which is why I gave 2 stars. This place needs help
Jack in the Box,13,Pick up the pace  Dear lord this Jack in the Box has no urgency and is incapable of handling low volume business levels and small  simple ways orders.
Jack in the Box,14,I was told this was a 24 hour fast food establishment. Yet in a long 10 cars deep drive through  we re told that systems maint will be down  4 am  so they couldn t accommodate any more orders    So  why not have someone close off the drive through entrance or have a staff member come out and say we re closed.  Yet many of us are waiting in a LONG line with no expected food on a Saturday night in Austin        20 minutes to leave...  Never will be back
Jack in the Box,15,Went yesterday walked in the lobby 3 30 21 at 3 33pm. I told the woman at the register 4 times I would like a crispy chicken southwestern salad with an extra southwest dressing and spicy sticks. She seemed to need help from her coworker to place my order. I get my receipt and eventually the salad. Went to work sat down to eat only to realize they gave me the wrong salad. I looked at the receipt called the restaurant. At first they didn t answer. I kept calling and finally got someone. I asked to speak to the manager. She got on the phone and I tried to explain what happened. I told her the name on my receipt is nancy. She tells me you must have the wrong store. No nancy works here and hangs up in my face. I call back and tried to explain I was just in your lobby. The manager replies the lobby is locked. I told her what I was wearing and she hung up on me again. I called back 2 more times and she hung up 2 more times. During the last time I asked her how is it my fault an ex employees name is on my receipt. I called again someone else answers the phone. This person tells me no nancy works here and hangs up in my face too. I call back and let them know I m on my way. I had to leave work catch the bus back up there. I banged on the door to get their attention when I arrived. No one responded. So I called and told them I m here. The manager answered and told me to calm down as if I was loud and seemed violent. I told her I am calm. She opens the lobby.  They locked it after I left . I follow her and go to the counter. She ask to see my receipt. As clear as day it says the time 3 33pm 3 30 21 I was in the lobby and what do you know the name nancy is on my receipt. First thing out of her mouth is oh I have to change that. I responded so your not going to apologize. She apologized  but it was not genuine she didn t feel bad at all about how she hung up on me 4 times or messing up my order. She kept my receipt. She gave me the correct salad and I told her God Bless You. Then it dawned on me I asked her weren t you the one who took my order. She said yes. I headed back to work. Once I got back to work I looked at my salad and it had bad cucumbers on it  it was starting to change colors . I decided to call back and get the number for corporate to make a complaint. The manager answered I asked for corporate number. She asked me why. I told her I have a complaint. She wasn t  giving me the number so I asked her whats the managers name. She wouldn t give that either. I told her what my complaint was. She responded I am the manager you can look up corporate number online God Bless You and hung up in my face for a 5th time. I wrote my complaint to corporate online. When it got to the portion to put in your phone number to be contacted their system wouldn t accept my number. Whoever this female manager is deserves to be fired. She was really rude and she was the one who made the mistake. She has absolutely no customer service skills. I was completely disrespected even in the end when she said God Bless You before hanging up in my face once again. She said it to be funny  but the jokes on her. You do not play with God. She didn t even offer me anything for the inconvenience of her own mistake and making me have to leave work. I really called to see if they would just replace my salad tomorrow and I was going to go without eating. Instead I was being called a liar and disrespected. Went back today 3 31 21 Lobby was locked. What restaurant locks their doors during the day  If you don t have a car you can t eat there and they don t care 
Jack in the Box,16,Really bad employee there. I ask for a chocolate shake with extra chocolate and she put more than extra chocolate it was really dark   so i ask if she can change it and with a bad attitude she gave me another chocolate shake.  By the way She wasn t using the name tag.
Jack in the Box,17,Oh my God..this jack n a box is a joke.. didn t even toast the sour dough jack that was ordered and didn t give the other half of my order and no recite..when I go back to get the rest of the order the same lame worker who waited on me was of course at the drive thru window and had the ordacity to ask me for the recite that he didn t give the first time I came through..and what s so sad is that it wasn t even busy there I was the only customer to serve other than the one car ahead of me..
Jack in the Box,18,Worst jack in the box experience I ve ever had went around 11 because I had a coupon ordered my food when I got to the window Johana was kind of rude and in a rush asked for coupon without a greeting not even a hello gave her the coupon and money she quickly closes the window  and turns around and text on her phone I guess that s why she was in such a rush she gives us our food on our way home check the bag and items are missing pull back up to Jack and tell her on the intercom she says oh yea the fries like she already knew then I had to wait in line for 30  minutes when I get to the window I express to her that my food was cold now could she replace it she tells me no because in her words  it was hot when they gave it to us. Like that BULLS    is unacceptable so I asked for a refund she didn t even apologize or anything and then didn t even give me my coupon back JOHANA should definitely find employment elsewhere
Jack in the Box,19,Although the food was still delicious  this restaurant was extra filthy. I observed the kitchen floor to be unswept and many of the dining tables  and customer area floors  were still littered with customer trash and yucky goo  used ketchup packets  liquids  dirty napkins  etc . I did see one employee sweeping the kitchen near the end of my visit  but the customer areas remained soiled.
Jack in the Box,20,DONT EAT HERE    NONE of the employees are wearing GLOVES   I saw the lady put fries in the fryer  make  tacos and burgers with her HANDS  Disgusting  And another employee at the window was making drinks and giving food and taking money from customers with no gloves on. I just walked out...I can t believe they are not taking this COVID shit seriously
Jack in the Box,21,this is literally the worst fast food restaurant i have ever been to. their employees don t give a flying fuck  it takes 15 mins to get through the drive through  and that s if you re the only one in line. ordered a small curly fries and sat at the window for 5 mins while the 3 employees inside laughed and ignored me.
Jack in the Box,22,The worst Jack in the box. I literally don t know how they re still in business. Every time I go by here between 3-5 AM  they ignore us  say their system is resetting or make up some sad excuse not to work. Do not go here.
Jack in the Box,23,Just tried to use the restroom and they re locked. What kind of place locks their bathroom but keeps their place as messy as it is. Guess you don t get my business 
Jack in the Box,24,Best burger ever. I like the staff in this one and I enjoy my lunch every time I take it. Keep it up guys
Jack in the Box,25,This by far the worst Jack In The Box in the Austin area. Shitty service and long wait times for FAST food.
Jack in the Box,26,I can t include the JIB  because I did not get a receipt  one of many complaints.  I went to this location yesterday to get some tacos  arrived 6 15am. There was a truck in front of me. I sat behind him at the window for at least 10minutes. He leaves  I can see a lady talking to what appears to be the cook  then go through the swinging door  out the front door  get in her car and drive away. I waited at the window 5 more minutes...NO ONE EVER CAME.  Fluke you say  Today I try again  One vehicle in front of me ordering. 5 minutes waiting behind them at the ordering window. I finally get up to the window...I wait approx 4 minutes for anyone to say anything...I place my order. Pull behind the other vehicle  wait another 5minutes. Finally get to the window....low and behold...someone comes to the window ....and says.... what did you order    Seriously....wait...it is a hard one...get a pen out....4 TACOS     The worst 2 fast food drive through experiences I have ever had. The tacos I longed for...were absolutely terrible  had a burnt taste  had to throw them away   Also never got a receipt and was too mad to notice until I was 1 2 way to work 
Jack in the Box,27,Aww jankiest Jack I ve ever seen. Bless their hearts. Broken machines and confused newbies. Wonky POS systems. The company is failing their wonderful employees who bust their butts doing everything in their power to serve the customers. Corporate needs to get it together.
Jack in the Box,28,This is the worst Jack in the Box I have ever been too. When I visited inside there was a large ginger woman who was acting as expo. She had no idea what she was doing. She fell behind on orders and the cute girl and the register was trying her best but the ginger lady prevented her from helping. It was the worst experience I have ever had for take out.
Jack in the Box,29,Went there for breakfast  because Hangovers. I had a great time with the manager he seemed very happy to be at work and even though I was slow this morning he was full of energy. Shoutout to this Jack in the Box.
Jack in the Box,30,This location should be closed. Everytime I come here it is not clean. When I come through the drive-thru they tell me that I can only order fried items. Most recently  I sat for 10 minutes waiting to order  to be told that I can t order anything but fried food. Service is bad  the place isn t clean. Don t go here.
Jack in the Box,31,Awful experience. 20 minutes in the drive thru until someone even took our order. Repeatedly told us they were counting cash. Took even longer to get food. Huge line of cars forming behind us. Won t be back
Jack in the Box,32,I ve visited a lot of jack in the box locations in my time  and this one has the friendliest staff and the best service so far. Every other jack in the box runs out of ingredients  are way too slow  and generally have poor customer service. This location always gets my order right  and even sometimes throws in a little extra just for kicks  today I got extra fries  Thanks    Most folks only take the time to review a fast food place if the service was terrible  but I wanted to leave my remarks and my thanks for being consistently awesome 
Jack in the Box,33,Thank you Jack in the Box on Oltorf for satisfying my hunger quickly and for satisfying my other food vice -- Jack in the Box tacos.  I was in that area for a training class at work and wanted a quick bite.  I satisfied my lunch cravings with a few cheap tacos and a large iced tea.  Kudos for a correctly filled order and having real iced tea.  For those of you who drink Coke products  they also have a Coca-Cola Freestyle machine at this location.
Jack in the Box,34,Midnight  4am  5 am  Always closed late night for some stupid reason or another. I don t understand why they pretend to be a 24 hour store. You re lucky if you ever catch them open after 10pm.
Jack in the Box,35,Here as i write this. Jib 845 time is 1 08 20 and the date is 3 23 2017. Rude manager  ignored multiple people as i stood patiently waiting for sweet tea since none was made for the loby. Over heard the rude manager tell her employees to speak in Spanish not in English. Then tried to not let me dine in as i had said it was for here when asked.
Jack in the Box,36,Walked in and the manager and crew were fighting with each other the entire time. The cashier forgot to ring something up and was very polite about it but the manger on duty lost her temper. They also ran out of change and the crew member gave us change from his pocket and the manager was rude and wouldn t come get him more change for the till. It felt like the crew was trying to deal with the managers temper the entire time.
Jack in the Box,37,Ordered western chicken salad in drive through  got home and the salad had no chicken at all . Thanks
Jack in the Box,38,Good service. Second time in this location moved from Boston  MA. Jack doesn t live there. Def will be back.
Jack in the Box,39,I went to Jack in the Box  as I do pretty often. I placed my order at the drive thru. Everybody was very friendly. I got to the window to pay  and realized I didn t have my wallet. I apologize  and started to pull away. The manager smile  handed me my food  and said Merry Christmas.. It s that kind of customer service that should be taught around the country. In all seriousness  if I could give them 10 stars  I would.
Jack in the Box,40,Absolutely the worst Jack in the Box in Texas  the worst staff of  workers  under one roof.
Jack in the Box,41,Unfriendly staff and extra long wait times. Set it the drive through for 20 minutes with no sorry or explanation  the lane is also not big enough to get out if you re trapped between cars . Food was cold by the time we got it. Overall one of the worst fast food experiences I ve had.
Jack in the Box,42,My bf and i got food poisoning. We contacted the customer service email thing.  I hope they fix the employee problems that they have and especially the food. Sometimes they get it right  other times they don t.
Jack in the Box,43,Would have given 0 stars if I could. There was a cockroach in the box of chicken strips. Enough said
Jack in the Box,44,I m so disgusted with this jack n the box because first off and foremost I called around 3am asking for a order to go and asked if I could walk up to the window to get my order and the lady proceeds to tell me that first the ice cream machine was broke and then finishes my disappointment with I had to be in side of a vehicle in order to pick up my order... This is the craziest answer that I have ever received from am employer I asked what the difference between the vehicle or just being on my two feet picking up my order and I couldn t even get an answer on y I couldn t walk to the window so I believe that this is racism for one cause that is pretty much in my opinion telling me well your white I can t serve u unless u r a different color... And I feel that that is judging cause I just live right behind this jack in the box so y would I drive to waste gas when I can just walk over there but no it s against their policy to allow someone to walk to the drive thru so I definitely will NOT ever go back to this place. They lost a everyday customer and this lady discriminated me cause I don t have a vehicle to come get my order but that s sure fine cause I will be calling tbe district manager and filing a complaint bout this as well as  how filthy and unprofessional the employer s are and keep the restaurant not clean swept  tables wiped after customer s leave  nothing is kept stocked  and last but not least how I watched the cook the last time i was inside waiting for my order after 20mins of ordering extremely slow nasty cook that doesn t wear gloves while preparing our food...    So there this nasty place has lost a few customers and because of their racial profiling . Will continue to investigate y this has happened to me tonight... Maybe speaking with the district manager and solve these problems ..                                                                
Jack in the Box,45,Greedy marry the franchisee  wants to make money by charging for water. She was nice but greedy. Corporate need to rectify this.
Jack in the Box,46,this location is the slowest i ve ever seen and they are consistent with their slowness. expect a half hour wait for your food no matter how many people are ahead of you. today i went in and ordered a sausage sandwich  and three orders of hash browns. ten minutes after my order they finally told me that they were completely out of hash browns. i changed my order to curly fries. now i m late for work. They never offered to adjust the price  i paid more for the hash browns than i would ve ordering curly fries . I get to work and i have a ham sandwich instead of sausage. never again will i go there.
Jack in the Box,47,Literally called ahead to make sure they had rice. That said yes and then 5 minutes later in the drive through they said they wouldn t have rice for 20 minutes. Can t find good honest help these days.
Jack in the Box,48,Kind of dirty but the food franchise Ike jack in the box is nice. We don t have it in NY. I loved it .
Jack in the Box,49,It s Jack In The Box  so there s that. Cheap tacos  24 hr drive through  great for after the bar.  The downsides  rude staff at the drive through  and they take FOREVER to make your food.  If you can  go to another location.
Jack in the Box,50,Yelp has yet to do a 0 star rating feature because I nearly gagged when I stuck my hand in to grab some curly fries. never asked for ketchup but they gladly served me an all over ketchup smothered container for my curly fries. f   ng nasty my dudes     get your act together. it s just fries.
Jack in the Box,51,The girl at the Drive thru kept getting my breakfast order wrong. When I got to the window and explained the order face-to-face  literally sausage biscuit  hash brown  and a drink  she just went to the kitchen to have them edit the order this still over charging me  because instead of doing the meal option she charged me for each individual item  when I brought this up she kept saying  next time  with a big smile on her face  the. Telling me how much cheaper it would have been if she had done the meal and said  for next time . Got home and the meal is still wrong.... I should have just gone somewhere else because this place always messes up my order  no matter how simple it is.
Jack in the Box,52,By Austin standards  this neighborhood is a dump. But compared to other places like Houston s fourth ward and fifth ward  this place is still very safe and middle class to walk into. The staff are friendly and get your order correct. I ve never had a problem.
Jack in the Box,53,They got my order wrong. Which was to be expected at a fast food place at 5 in the morning. But what was most disappointing was that they avoided picking up the phone for literally 15 minutes when I attempted to call and report my incorrect order once I was already home. I made sure to call like literally 20 times in succession UNTIL they answered  simply to try to prove a point. It required much less energy of them to NOT answer the phone then it would have cost them to simply pick up on the first or second try. They even went as far as to take the phone off the hook at one point  so that it would give me a busy signal after they realized I wasn t going to stop calling. After like 4 busy signals  they gave up on ignoring me and finally answered. The girl who answered was rude AS FUCK. I also recognize her voice from the drive thru  but  she insisted on asserting the fact that she had just walked into work and heard the phone ringing. She was very short with me and cutting me off in speech. She then finally put me forcibly on hold to get a manager who finally listened to my gripe with my order. All in all  I give them a negative 10 out of 10. Pure shit service.
Jack in the Box,54,Bad service. Cold food. Forgets to give you ketchup or salad dressing. Always out of something essential on the menu. Would avoid this location.
Jack in the Box,55,Tables aren t not wiped down often and floor is very sticky with soda or something. The cooks and the drive thru girl normally takes their cigar breaks outside near the entrance. And unsafe neighborhood surrounding. Expect to be pandhandlers inside this Jack in a Box.
Jack in the Box,56,I tried this location again just now and they had their drive through closed for some reason. I have no idea why they re so averse to the idea of making money  but they apparently are  since they make it so fucking difficult to order food from them.
Jack in the Box,57,Gave this location three chances since it s close to home and it s open late. Every time they were out of whatever it was I wanted. Two of the times I went through the drive-thru the staff was completely unprofessional. One girl made fun of my accent over the intercom while I was ordering and another guy acted like he was high off his     when he was taking my money.  Skip it and go to the Whataburger across the street if you need fast food late at night in this neighborhood.
Taqueria La Tapatia,1,Good food.  Cheap prices.  Delicious pastries  when in stock .  Homemade tortillas.  Not many places you can get a breakfast plate for under  3.  Or 3 tacos for the same.  I ve eaten breakfast  lunch  and late night dinner here.  All have been hot  made fresh  and cheap.  On the weekends  I order the menudo and I have to admit  it s pretty tasty.
Taqueria La Tapatia,2,If your into cheap Mexican food  this place has your covered. I think there is nothin over  6. Damn I m old  the last time I stepped into this building it was Dunkin Donuts..   My two meat combo plate combined portions of Al Pastor and Barbacoa. Both were the bottom of the barrel as far as meat quality was concerned. Fatty meat which I normally love was just Meh when not even heated up properly. Rice and beans were good as were the tortillas.   Not bad  just not that good either. Can t we get a Discount Tire near a five star joint 
Taqueria La Tapatia,3,Taco   a tortilla folded over a ground spicy filling.  This taqueria only has a one bullet hole rating according the the front window.  I was a little hesitant when I only saw one hole.  The best Taqerias usually have at least 3 bullet holes in the window out front.    I was greatly surprised on how good the food was.  Try a Torta which is a large fresh baked bun.  Similar to a hamburger bun.  it is filled with your choice of filling.  I like the al pastor.  Or the Pasture Torta.  It is shredded pork with Avocado  lettuce  Tomato  and Mayonnaise.  If you want it a little richer. You can order it  Cubana  which means that they add sliced ham and melted Swiss cheese.    Their salsa is outstanding.  Pretty hot with a great flavor of cilantro and raw onions.    If you go in the morning  you can get three tacos for  1.99.  Tortas for lunch are  2.99 With cubana style a little extra.    The staff barely speaks English  but they will manage to take your order better than some crappy fast food joint.    God bless the Taco
Taqueria La Tapatia,4,Hunger Crisis Averted  I made a quick stop here looking for take-out tacos and an Ice-Tea. Success   These items were obtained and were reasonably tasty. From my small sample  I found the al pastor better than the chicken taco. Both pretty reasonable for a  1.60 taco.  I will need to try them again for a chicken burrito sometime in the future.  I do have a gripe that they charge  2 for an ice tea.  Seems like any of the other taquerias I frequent charge  1 or  1.50 for tea.  Either way - better than stopping at some chain fast food place.
Taqueria La Tapatia,5,I think they have this on the wrong side of the frontage road on the map. Anyway - if one was to write an article on how to spend  20 a day in Austin  TX - you d have to throw in Tapatia into the mix for breakfast.   I ve only had the migas but it s pretty yummy  probably too large sized of a portion  and with a slice of ham on top. I think the cost is something ridiculous like  3 before 11am and  4 after 11am. This is the type of place where you go with three friends and someone picks up the entire tab without a fight because it s basically nothing - breakfast with a couple buddies is like  16.   Will have to test out their other food but may be a while as I like my migas on the weekend.
Taqueria La Tapatia,6,Do not get the chicken enchiladas. If you do there will be all parts of the chicken masked inside. The price is right but you can pay a little more for much better food.
Taqueria La Tapatia,7,Tacos were pretty good  but even with perfectly cooked chicken  it doesn t remove the hair that was found in the food. Sorry ya ll  I understand these things happen  but when your food is not outstanding  you don t have much room for error.
Taqueria La Tapatia,8,We just spent the weekend in Austin and we fell in love with this place.  It s super charming in a greasy spoon type of way and lots of people in there.  Anyway  we ordered breakfast tacos 2 mornings  3 for  2.50  I believe and they were delicious.  I ordered chips the second morning just because they looked so good.  And they didn t disappoint.  They were the best chips and salsa of the trip.  I wish we could have gone for lunch.   Love   
Taqueria La Tapatia,9,Well  darn.  I hadn t eaten here in several months  and just picked up some tacos the other morning.  They re not as good as they used to be.  Less cheese than before  and the salsa is watery.  I ll give them another shot  but I m seriously considering checking out the taqueria down the street.
Taqueria La Tapatia,10,Cheap prices   1 mile from the office   half a dozen lunch time visits with coworkers.  Change anything in that equation and I doubt I would have gone back after the first visit.     The enchiladas verde were okay  and probably the best thing I had there.  Nothing was bad  but nothing was particularly good either.
Taqueria La Tapatia,11,Great prices  but service and quality were not as good as other Austin area locations.
Taqueria La Tapatia,12,I found myself with an extra hour while waiting for the hubby to arrive at the airport.  I decided to find a little hole in the wall to get some queso and a margarita to pass the time.  I drove around Burleson  he came in at the International terminal which is WAY on the other side of the airport  looking for my chips and booze and I couldn t find anything that either a  looked safe enough to go into b  wasn t a boobie bar or c  was open.  I finally found Taqueria La Tapatia on the frontage road of Ben White.  I walked in  checked out their menu and found that they did not have any queso or booze.  Damn.  Well  I was already here  so I ordered the chips salsa and a pork taco.   The chips were thick and crunchy and were edible on their own  but the salsa had a nice flavor which kicked up the chips a notch.   The pork taco was disappointing  the meat was slightly dry and was flavorless.  The onions  cilantro and cheese helped out a bit but overall it is not something I would order again.
Taqueria La Tapatia,13,There isn t much to say about La Tapatia.  Most of their food is tasty and inexpensive.  The service isn t the best  but it is not bad either.  It is a good place for a cheap meal.
Jaliscienses Mexican Restaurant,1,This little dive deserves more credit then it s getting...I say dive in the kindest way..it small..a little dark inside but very clean...Staff was very friendly and attentive during our whole visit...Chip  Salsa and Queso to start...they bring 2 bottles of sauce to the table as well...the red had some kick and it kicked up the Queso just right..The granddaughter went with the regular Quesadilla  and she wished she went with a large one...but we gave her a Queso of her own and she was fine..we both went with the Enchilada Mexicanas...wife with ground beef   no beans...mine chicken with beans and rice...it also can with steak cecina...did t know what to expect...but it was actually really good...very thin  crisp and had a great charred flavor..we both enjoyed our food...Beans and rice were solid to...overall a great visit for us...The plates of breakfast grub going by while waiting looked killer...we will try that next round..
Jaliscienses Mexican Restaurant,2,Great authentic Mexican Food. Breakfast is our favorite  Try the chilaquiles verdes. Amazing   
Jaliscienses Mexican Restaurant,3,Great little hole in the wall. As soon as you sit  you get greeted with chips and 3 different fresh salsas. My favorite was the green  it was Smokey in a way. Great service and our food came out really fast. Will be back soon 
Jaliscienses Mexican Restaurant,4,Excellent food made to order. Tortillas are hand made and service is great. Will recommend to family and friends.
Jaliscienses Mexican Restaurant,5,City officials begging  people to wear face covers when around other people  walk in to pick up  not a single employee wearing a face mask. Gross  will never spend a dime with this business.
Jaliscienses Mexican Restaurant,6,This spot is amazing  GREAT service  And friendly atmosphere  The food is also amazing and super affordable.
Jaliscienses Mexican Restaurant,7,Feeling sick - ordered enchiladas from here ... has to be the worst I ever had.  Smothered with cheese  no sauce and the chicken was dry and definitely had a freezer burnt taste.  NEVER AGAIN
Jaliscienses Mexican Restaurant,8,I love how Marisol and Kimberly took care of me. It is cold outside and my storage unit is just down the road. But  this morning I was having issues getting in to my unit  so I came here. Their love for the customer is  mainly why I would come back   
Taco Bell,1,Always in and out. Helps save a buck or two. Just remember  Pepsi soda choices. Get your hot sauce on.
Taco Bell,2,Not impressed w service .  As soon as I stood there for about 5 minutes the manager tells me I have to order on kiosk .   I m new still to all this stuff . I asked to order at cashier and was told it better at kiosk. So I ordered on kiosk   that took me a good while to figure out.   Mind you   never once did anyone ask to help . Definitely don t recommend .. Then as I m leaving I asked for hot sauce as It gave option on kiosk to ask for sauce. The young lady says  oh you have to get your own over there .  I m not wanting to be a Karen but it be helpful if they would ask or give option to order.
Taco Bell,3,Yeah it s Taco Bell. We all know Taco Bell isn t a five star restaurant but man.... The two people working the drive thru had some of the best customer service I ve experienced at a fast food joint. Thanks for holding it down for that 11pm taco run and keeping a good attitude making my day a little better. Shout out Taco Bell for existing
Taco Bell,4,When you go to pick up an order  they don t tell you you have to wait in line in the drive-thru. The direction say you can pick up in the lobby but it s closed. I understand you re short staffed and covid but how about updating the apps and or putting a sign outside telling people they need to get on the drive-thru    So inconsiderate.
Taco Bell,5,I was pretty hesitant to go back to any Taco Bell in Austin based on prior experience over the years and the mountain of bad reviews  but that s what the kids wanted so here I am.  I have to give credit where credit is due.  I was surprised to find everything was easy  quick  correct  and good.  The manager on duty at this location reminded me of Gus Fring...in his professional manner only  not his status as television s favorite drug kingpin.  Just go inside  order from the kiosk  and everything will be fine.  I promise.  But it would be nice if they had a better way of labeling what taco burrito is what so you can more easily disperse them to the intended recipients.
Taco Bell,6,Before Im even stopped at the order window im being asked what i want.l twice... i start my order and before im done order hes giving me a total. Theres one car in front if me and me in line  thats it. I complete my order and wait for it. I drive home and start eating two of the tree burritos have no meat or beans. I could somewhat understand if the line was around the corner but it wasn t.  I call to complain and get a fax machine..
Taco Bell,7,Wow THANKS for the Extremely OLD AND HARD AND NASTY naked chicken chalupas. Starving after a long hard shift and I get this  Just wow. I would have waited for it to be fresh I don t care I would rather have food that didn t sound like chewing on rubber bands and taste like it too  Y all can do better.
Taco Bell,8,I am a regular here and I use coupons to get my tacos.  The taco bell app doesn t allow me to use more than one coupon in one order so I have to make two separately orders. Today the ladies asked me rudely why I do that The tall lady that makes the tacos in the back was complaining about it to her coworker and I heard her.  It doesn t cause that big of an inconvenience but it was rude that they made me feel bad for wanting to use coupons.
Taco Bell,9,Even in a city like Austin where taco choices are abundant  sometimes you just want a little Taco Bell.  It s not exactly the greatest Tex Mex  but it reminds me of childhood days.  Not to mention it s got the uniform taste so you know that whichever Taco Bell you hit - it s going to taste exactly the same.  But honestly  we drench it in Fire and Diablo sauce  so really what we re doing is just eating sauce.    I tend to stick to Taco Supremes cause they re basic.  But occasionally I like a tostada  and the guilty pleasure of a Dorito taco  why didn t they make these sooner  .  I also like nachos b c chips and cheese.
Taco Bell,10,If you re going to ask drive through customers to pull around front and wait for their food  can you please not forget about them  After waiting out front for 20 minutes  I was finally able to flag down an employee who was bringing food out to someone else that was parked. I had to remind her what I had been waiting for  and then she forgot items in my order when she finally brought it out.   As you can imagine  after having my food sit on a counter inside for 20 minutes  once I finally got to eat it  it was completely soggy. The crunchy tacos fell apart and the nachos were more like a gross tortilla soup.
Taco Bell,11,So going through the drive thru and uh you left your mic on. To hear they say i don t like these people while our kids are ordering. Then ask about it and they were like I was talking to my co worker. Uhm yeah about us we didn t say anything to warrant that. Yep if my kid wasn t hungry I would have left wont go back.
Taco Bell,12,Never again will I order food from this location. Like once a year I crave TB  but the service is horrible. Staff is rude. This is just a reminder why I don t need to eat crappy food because of crappy service and it s just not good.
Taco Bell,13,The cash register girl wasn t very knowledgeable of her own menu and I tried to essentially recreate the double chalupa that she says doesn t exist anymore and ended up spending  12 for 3 tacos and a burrito. This Taco Bell has a very bad rating and I understand why I should fire the management and retrain the staff.
Taco Bell,14,Decent drive through. The speaker quality is good and the service is quick. The order was accurate.
Taco Bell,15,If i could give this place zero stars i would. Lady got our order wrong then gave us attitude when she realized she had given us 10 tacos instead of the only two we ordered. We definitely could ve driven off with 10 tacos and she still probably wouldn t even noticed. Then after asking us to pull up to the front - she still got our order wrong.. long story short  maybe if you come to this location around 10pm you ll get extra free tacos cause the people who work there obviously don t know how to read .
Taco Bell,16,Hit the drive thru earlier got the food quickly with friendly service and tasted great like usual with TB
Taco Bell,17,The reason for this comment is because I went to this Taco Bell and I ordered the chalupa combo  and my home from this place is like 5 minutes and when I got home I was ready to enjoy my chalupa and gave my first bite it was pretty cold inside and out I hope this comment helps the employees do a better job.
Taco Bell,18,Me and my girl got the Munchies after work and taco bell did the job  5 stars for quick munchies
Taco Bell,19,Made very quick and with love. Love their power chicken bowl. Very friendly too   Never have any issues with speed here.
Taco Bell,20,Extremely disappointed in this place and since I can t give negative reviews they get 1 Star.. my husband went to pick up dinner for our family tonight and they were in a hurry to close down because registers were not working apparently..we ordered food and of course half the order was wrong..EVERY time we go to both locations of Taco Bell they get the order wrong fully or partially..there is NO EXCUSE for this sort of thing..if you are taking money from a customer you are expected to get the order CORRECT EVERY SINGLE TIME   It s not hard to make sure orders are correct. Incompetent teenagers are employed there and it s not right.. no excuse ever  And free food won t make up for the mistakes because we would put you out of business just on free food that s how bad you all SUCK at getting orders right  
Taco Bell,21,Messed up my 2 vegetarian burritos I ordered al fresco. They gave me a steak and a chicken burrito. I drive back to the restaurant after getting home to replace my burritos.  The person at the window insisted on inspecting the burrito and made me give them my already purchased burritos back through the drive thru. They didnt seem to believe me like I was trying to scam them out of two 3 dollar burritos.  They told me I was confused  that the meat was actually beans. This was hostile treatment just over me wanting to get the burritos I ordered. Check your food before you drive off maybe even record yourself ordering as ridiculous as that sounds. One star because I cant give zero.
Taco Bell,22,I went to the drive-thru an hour and a half before closing time  and they wouldn t serve me because they  already put everything away .    This was bizarre. I had to drive to another Taco Bell because I d already told my pregnant GF I was getting her a crunch wrap. Don t go here.
Taco Bell,23,Usually you would have to wait for a long time in the drive through even if there are no cars. Today  there was a long line of cars  but I got my food in a minute  thanks to Sebastian s work ethic  He also provided the best customer service. Thank you
Taco Bell,24,This is the most frustrating drive through in Austin   Ive lived in this neighborhood for 4 years  and the staff here is beyond ridiculous. They regularly do not serve customers or claim they are out of ingredients  one time they claimed they were out of every ingredient on the menu.  I do not know why every 6 months I give it another shot  its never changed  and every time I have to drive to William Cannon instead.   Below is a video I took tonight  I sat in line for 5 minutes before they acknowledged I was there  the first time they talked to me was when I started the video below. I asked multiple times if they were there before recording to no response.    a href   redir url https 3A 2F 2Fyoutu.be 2FzUcmm9aNxtg amp s 954f711963d9d36caea0a209b22cd789001955e176c51823f5daabda13e8f33a  rel  nofollow  target  _blank  youtu.be zUcmm9aNxtg  a 
Taco Bell,25,My order was correct but I was a little uncomfortable listening to a worker argue with a customer through the window. I dont know what it was about but it didnt sound professional.
Taco Bell,26,The female manager that worked on 7 30 19 at 10 30pm was extremely rude and hateful. I could not understand what the man on the speaker was saying because he was mumbling so she spoke loudly and slowly  mocking me. She spoke to me like I was intellectually disabled. It was extremely offensive. My son is special needs and children have spoken to him that way to make fun of him. I asked for different kinds of sauce at the window. The man said he d get it. The woman in the manager  plaid type  shirt came to the window and refused. I said I just wanted an assortment of sauces and she rolled her eyes. She bagged it up for me then handed it to me. I said thank you and she gave me a hateful look and walked away. I definitely will never go to this location again. That woman should not work on a position like that if she is so hateful.
Taco Bell,27,The last time I was here  they told me they ran out of straws and my food was cold when I ordered through the drive-through. I was the designated driver this evening and I was trying to grab food for everybody  but 30 minutes before they are supposed to close  everything is shut down including the drive-through. Very poor business....  Today  my Mexican Pizza is two tortillas with refuted beans inside and salad on top. NO cheese  NO tomatoes  NOTHING  See picture.  Update  tonight I ordered a combination meal that should have a Mexican pizza and two tacos  and three additional taco Supremes. But I actually got was a burrito supreme with three tacos and nothing else. It s unfortunate that I m not more of a careless driver or I would ve realized this sooner.  If there were literally anything comparable in the area  this would cease to be my last option.  So here s a neat update  I ordered on the app and sat at the drive-through for 10 minutes and when nobody answered I pulled up to the window where I was blatantly ignored. After several minutes of sitting there  because I had already ordered and paid for my food  I honked the horn and still nobody answered. Another several minutes later a female employee and her manager came to the window  which I have on video  and told me they were closed. It was well before closing time  almost an hour  and there were people inside. They refused services even though I already paid for my food. I have it all on video  this place has the single most incompetent failures in employees that it s disgusting. One of the moms of one of the employees tried to harass me for taking a video of their refusal  and was combative to a fault. That s exactly the kind of classy behavior I would expect from the mother of an employee at this location  She seemed like she would probably have been more aggressive if I wasn t also videotaping her  nothing I did was illegal and this place has officially been reported to their corporate office. I can t wait to see how many people get fired over this....
Taco Bell,28,Slowest drive through I think I ve ever experienced.  Horrible  horrible  horrible. Just horrible.
Taco Bell,29,OHMYGODTHATWASSUCHAMISTAKE  I might be dying  I m not sure yet.   This might be the last review I ever write. Death by Taco Bell.  Someone  tell my children I love them.
Taco Bell,30,Very unskilled management with customer service that doesn t even come with a smile. Really shows lack of customer care and the food doesn t seem to come out to what s it s supposed to be.
Taco Bell,31,We ordered 4 items.  A taco  a bean and cheese only burrito  and a beef and cheese only burito.  Got home with a taco no cheese  bean burrito stuffed with onions  and some concoction that had rice  fritos  and something else that I could not  tell what it was.  I called to request a refund only to be told they could not do refunds  She asked if it was a boy or girl that took our order  I told her we were just there  and it was a female.  She then hung up on me.  I think they must have been closing down and just gave us more than what we asked for.  I know good help is hard to find  but this was ridiculous.
Taco Bell,32,I called to make sure they would be open if I drove 15 min out of my way. They did they were open till 1 am. It s 12 45. I m sitting at their drive through. No one... What was the point of answering my call and lying to me 
Taco Bell,33,Taco Bell hits the spot. This was my first meal back for a brief furlough since being away from the States for a couple years.  Needless to say  I was excited to fulfill my years long craving with only the best Mexican food that my home country had to offer.  And truly  Taco Bell was the best Mexican food that I had that day.    Now some will argue that Taco Bell is not really Mexican food.  However  if you use the barometer one might use for Asian cuisine  I definitely saw Latinos eating there.  Thus -- it s real Mexican food.  The same cannot be said for the patrons at  Mexican  establishments such as La Condessa  Polvos  and Fonda San Miguel   Gringos   tons.  Latinos   zero.  Speciality items abound and I started my night with the Mexican Pizza  which I ve been told is apparently neither Mexican nor Pizza.  Nonetheless  it arrived masterfully prepared.  The crispy and fluffy crust was nostalgic for many a Mexican Pizza eaten in the waning hours of college nights.  It was a little more tart but much more cheesy than I recall but every bit as delicious--a beautiful combination of tart  savory  smokey  salty.  A new curveball thrown to me since my last run to The Border was the Dorito gordita.  This delight is a basically a taco supreme with a Dorito taco shell and I think a little hint of crack wrapped in a flour tortilla.  I surmise it would have been much better with Cool Ranch flavor but that is pure conjecture.    The pinnacle for this amazing meal was the nacho supreme.  I was equally moved by the mushy texture of this course as I was with the crunchiness of the first two.  Very little chewing was required to enjoy the mushiness of the chips  beans  cheese  sour cream  oh  glorious sour cream   and what I think was indeed some sort of beef product.   Overall  a great experience and wonderful reintroduction into American life.
Taco Bell,34,My husband and I live a couple of blocks from this Taco Bell location  so we figured we d swing by on our way home from a show downtown a couple of weeks ago  as this location is  open until 1 00am.  It was 11 00pm when we arrived... and the staff had turned out all of the lights and were smoking by the dumpsters. They definitely looked closed  but it was only 11 00  so we rolled down our window to ask if they were open. Not a soul replied verbally  but one of the employees looked at us and made some sort of hand gesture that we gather was meant to imply a no  My husband said   So... no   and the one employee just responded  Uh  nah.  It s also worth noting that one of the women present in this group of staff appears to be the manager  as we often see her out by the dumpster with employees when we drive by  almost daily  as it s on the way to most places we go  and she is dressed differently than the other individuals. I mean  we know it s Taco Bell  so we re not expecting The Ritz... but  seriously  I ve never seen a business run so blatantly carelessly.
Taco Bell,35,It is what it is.  It is the same Taco Bell you ll find on any street corner  USA.   If you re in the area  drunk  and the line at Whataburger is atrocious...this place fills a void in your tummy.       You will prob not feel too hot the next morning after throwing a  5 on top of 15 beers.   I didn t.
Taco Bell,36,I ordered 2 of the  1.00 Beefy Cheesy Burritos   1 Burrito Supreme   1 Chips and Salsa. Upon returning home and opening each the ONLY item that even looked like its picture was the Chips and Salsa. The dollar burritos were flat and had what looked like some kind of  mystery spread  on them and the burrito supreme was more like a burrito micro. The only way to get full was on the flour tortillas as there wasn t enough filling to feed a bird.  Certainly THE most awful fast food experience out here. Even Jack in the Crack has better.  Someone PLEASE put this Taco Smell out of its misery 
Taco Bell,37,An Ode to Chicken Grilled Stuffed Burritos.....  Driving to school after an eight hour day  my tummy growls  The Bell is calling.  Joy  Rapture  I pass one on my way   I place an order and my burrito is grilling. I drive to class  anticipating that first bite.   Marinated chicken  rice  and beans  pepper jack sauce  salsa  and cheese.   Grilled to perfection  the tortilla is toasty and cooked just right.   I park my car  restrained no more  I know what goodness means  Taco Bell  may I have another grilled stuffed burrito please    OK...... so not EXACTLY an Ode  but hey what do you expect for fast food   The drive through staff was not rude  but not friendly.  They were just doing their job. One thing is for sure  with all the Taco Bells I have gone to around town  I have thoroughly enjoyed my Chicken Grilled Stuffed Burrito every single time  How can you go wrong with grilled meat  beans  rice  and cheese  The pepper jack sauce is creamy and adds a nice touch. For me though  it s the fact that the whole thing is grilled that REALLY makes it good. Mmmmmm  toasty tortilla......
Taco Bell,38,Taco bell is what it is.. Even heard the NIck Swardson joke on this place  lol.. You should google it.   Anyway. I like their crispy tacos  and their Cheesy gordita crunch. That s about it.  Not much to say  not much of a review and I am sorry for that..   Till next time..  Go get you sum ..
Taco Bell,39,I primarily visit the Bell drive thru in order to snag a tall cold Pepsi. Other than the occassional taco  that s pretty much it. I don t consider them  mexican  food... just another snack.  I would like to say I like the newer sauces they ve come up with 
Taco Bell,40,I frequent this Taco Bell often as I live really close by and it s my favorite fast food restaurant. Well I ve noticed the last six months or so that the workers are extremely rude. Tonight was by far the worst  While ordering through the drive through the girl kept interrupting me and just had a bad attitude. I knew I should of just off. I m getting all four of my wisdom teeth removed tomorrow that being said I wanted a high calorie meal since I won t be eating eating for however long. I got two separate orders  one for my dad and one for myself and my son. The chola wannabe girl at the window was even worse than she was over the intercom. She gave me one bag of food. I figured it was all in there. I make sure to check my bag every time before I drive off. My entire order for myself was gone. I had to wave this girl down at the window and tell her my food was missing. She pretty much mocked me to whoever she yelled at in the back   The nacho supreme is missing   Some heavy set lady came to the and handed me the bag and said   the first bag was the first order and this is your second order . She had a crappy attitude as well but not as bad as the chola girl. I told her that the other girl handed me my first bag and shut the window and walked off. So I assumed all my food was in one bag. Anywho  I told the heavy set lady that I do come here often and that the other girl is very f      rude and that I would be contacting the manager  She just shut the window. I was not rude to these people so I don t understand why I was treated terribly as a paying customer. Well I got home and opened my bag of food two soft tacos and a nacho supreme. There was lettuce and cheese all over my wrapped tacos. It was obvious this was done on purpose. Well once I get healed up I will be making a call. To corporate. I m pretty sure the crappy employees are a reflection of whoever manages this Taco Bell. I don t know what happened to all the nicer employees that worked here. There is some decent ones that work day shift. Well I will not be bringing my business here EVER AGAIN   
Taco Bell,41,This Taco Bell is the slowest place I ve ever been. It took 40 minutes to make 3 tacos. If you have 40 minutes  enjoy 
Taco Bell,42,I feel that this taco bell is not one of the good ones... I have been to many. Im not sure how they managed to mess up an order that was just consisting of value meals... but they did...
Taco Bell,43,Very slow service after 5pm. Waiting nearly 20 minutes for my meal. The other times I been there I waited more than 30 minutes and ended up asking for a refund because I had to be somewhere. Management must keep the restaurant staffed on evenings.
Taco Bell,44,I ve never had a bad steak quesadilla at a taco bell. I literally had to pull out grisly pieces out of my mouth
Jack in the Box,1,star  1 for cheap food. Yay  Cheap Food. star  2 for GREAT customer service. The receipt says the cashier s name is Jaquline. Super friendly and service with a smile. She said she was sorry for the wait because i was apparently  kinda agged about how long it took for her to get to me  fast food should be fast  but who am i to demand quick service i m just trying to waste time while my car is being serviced for a few hours. As soon as i saw that she was friendly and looked like she enjoyed her job i totally forgot about what neighborhood i was in. star  3 quality of food edibleness... excited i got a choice between bacon or sausage   on my breakfast platter... with the scrambled eggs and hash brown sticks and  mini pancakes. Sure there s better breakfasts to be had elsewhere  but the jack in the box was closest to the Firestone and the food didn t suck. OH    and then there is the coca-cola fountain with the 100  flavors    how awesome ok soooooo..... star  4 for the 100 flavor coca-cola fountain. star  5 for being close to highland mall  Texas Worksource or whatever they call it now  and Firestone and not tooooooo far from greyhound station either  but probably to far for a layover. Of course Jack in the Box was always good stoner food back in high school when i was into being a stoner  b
Jack in the Box,2,I ordered 2 chicken sandwiches and 2 tacos and never have I ever been disappointed from jack in the box about my food but today I received the worst thing I could imagen  a mold bread sandwich
Jack in the Box,3,Went through the drive-through at lunchtime. The person who helped me at the window had her mask under her mouth  covering nothing. I looked past her and saw that the person working the counter had her mask under her chin  covering nothing. My question is this  if a restaurant manager allows their staff to flout the health measures that are meant to protect us from a pandemic  why would I trust that they re handling my food in a safe way  Needless to say  I won t be back.
Jack in the Box,4,I ordered food through the drive through. Got home.. two items I ordered and paid for were missing. Decided to drive back and tell them what was missing and they literally threw the food in our car and didn t listen to the fact that we had to drive back to get our full order. She started taking the order of someone behind us at the window and pretty much slammed the door in our face. Back home again and they only gave us one taco when we ordered two. We tried calling them and the phones are disconnected. Worst experience I ve ever had. I love Jack in The Box  so I am very disappointed.
Jack in the Box,5,Why even be open if you don t have the product to sell. If you can t get product close up shop. Disappointing
Jack in the Box,6,There s a lady who always looks half asleep and has hickeys at the drive through In the mornings. She always gives the orders wrong. I asked for a large caramel iced coffee and she gave me a regular which is okay  but when my mother nicely told her it was supposed to be a large she screamed at her and of course I said something back. It is not okay for her to be rude to her costumers just because she didnt get enough sleep. Also they never have the iced coffees done in the morning.
Jack in the Box,7,First time..... and it will be my last.... ordered two  7 s the ultimate bacon.... and guess what.... both burgers had only 1 strip of bacon cut into 3 small pieces.... REALLY     I paid  23.57 on my meal for this crap..... I didn t want to give any star ratings but I need to put one in order for me to put my review..... I never give bad reviews but this place just made me upset.... WTH.... maybe this is the reason why I never eat at Jack in the crack bc of their shity service.... this place sucks... if any of you all are near this place..... NEVER EVER COME IN HERE N EAT......
Jack in the Box,8,If you have coupons they treat you like shit. Horrible customer service. Food is as is at any location.
Jack in the Box,9,Clean location  friendly service  and amaaaaaaazing milkshakes. Don t let bad reviews keep you from trying out Jack in the Box 
Jack in the Box,10,This Jack in the Box has some good longterm employees that I ve seen.  One lady is particularly nice to customers.  I ve never gotten sick eating here and the food taste is fine  for fast food .    One star was deducted for the neighborhood--a stranger once sat next to me and asked for money.  He also wouldn t leave me alone until I gave him something.  If you come here  maybe you should sit closer to the counter.  That was probably an isolated incident  though--usually when I come in there are lots of young mothers with little kids or groups of teenagers.  I probably wouldn t eat here after dark.  This Jack in the Box is conveniently located at an intersection with the Highland Mall Metro Station along Airport Blvd.
Jack in the Box,11,Good place for some great  fast 2 for  .99 tacos any time of day or night. It can get a little crowded inside at lunch time  but I usually use the drive thru so no worries. I haven t had any great or horrible experiences here  just consistently normal fast food type interactions. It is convenient to get in and out of  so that s nice.
Jack in the Box,12,BUYER BEWARE...when they tell you in the drive through they will give you the total at the window  they re about to overcharge you. Take note of the price on the menu and check your receipt. This place is a RIP OFF
Jack in the Box,13,I m a fan. I even order  off the menu  here  Sourdough Breakfast Sandwich . The mango smoothies. are. so. d-lish.  And I don t care what kind of nonmeat is in them  I love the 2 for 99 cents tacos. I order them with extra lettuce because I m not too proud to ask for extra stuff on a 49.5 cent item.   And the mini cows commercial. C mon  that s funny stuff.
Jack in the Box,14,OK....... I know its Jack in the Box... but have you tried their Acapulco chicken salad      Cilantro Lime dressing  blue tortilla strips on top  jalap. jack chez  and a lime to squeeze on it.   I double checked the bag.... I was still at Jack in the crack.  That was the best fast-food salad I ve ever had  I just had to tell someone......
Jack in the Box,15,This Jack in the Box is filthy. Good fast food service  and decent food. But disgusting. Every table dirty  floor looks like it hasn t been mopped in days.  I had just a few bites of food  and both me and my guest were so grossed out we dumped the food and left.   Stay away from this location 
Jack in the Box,16,Look  It s a Jack  And it s in a crack   Seriously - how can Jack in the Crack ever get more than 3 stars  Don t get me wrong  this place is convenient to where I work and has been as good as a Jack in the Crack can be  but come on folks.....4 stars for Jack in the Crack 
Jack in the Box,17,Not very sincere at all  haste full and impatient. Need workers that speak English please.
Jack in the Box,18,This location sucks  real bad y all. The people are rude  no matter what time of day  or night. I don t think my order has ever been right  but I live down the street so convenience is what keeps me going back. If you don t have to eat at this location  please don t. Save yourself the frustration  or THOROUGHLY check your food before leaving.
Jack in the Box,19,I remember when this place used to be EMPTY. Yes  this was because it was next to the unemployment resource center. As a rule  unemployed people do not have loads of cash to go spend on fast food. And fast food does not take food stamps.   It was so EASY to get your order--and eat in peace.  It was nice to come and just read for uninterupted quiet time.   Well  now that ACC opened their new campus  this place is a madhouse. Students come over here for cheaper snacks than their on-campus concession stand. And the poor staff cannot keep up with the orders. They work as fast as humanly possible. But it s noisy and crowded.  It s best just to get your order and leave  quickly.
Jack in the Box,20,I don t know why this place has such good reviews. I visited last night  and couldn t get any sort of service from anyone. They saw me at the counter. I was the only one standing there  waiting. I made eye contact with them. They didn t make a move. I went up the street and gave Wendy s the business I had tried to give to Jack In The Box.
Jack in the Box,21,Its good dollar meals if your ever in a rush. Need a quick bite go to jack  but sont expect great food like in any other fast food chain. Nice service  no problems there. But hey its easy spend to get two tacos for at least under two bucks.
Jack in the Box,22,Horrible service. Not worth the risk of eating the food. When employees treat you terrible imagine how they treat your food.
Jack in the Box,23,I came here last night  amp  got worse service than when I used to go   3 30am on my graveyard lunch break. I got better quality food and customer care in the middle of the night than at actual dinner time. The girl at the window lost my order  amp  asked me three times if I had a strawberry shake. NO. My order did not magically turn into a strawberry shake after you already asked me once. Get me my side salad  amp  value fries  Finally a senior member came  amp  retook my order. After waiting all that time I received old stale fries. They were cold and mushy  not hot  amp  crisp. AND they were packed in the same bag as my chilled salad. Who packs hot foods with a cold salad   Well  if my fries were actually fresh this would have been a problem. Their salads always have freezer burn- adjust your settings  And my mini pancakes were bland lukewarm chewy sponges. Ugh. To finish off this experience was not one napkin in the bag. I know this is fast food  but seriously  
Jack in the Box,24,Went there late last night  drive thru took forever even though no one was in the line expect for me. The person at the window was rude  I asked for ranch dipping sauce they gave me honey mustard instead 0_o Won t be coming back to this Jack in the Crack  
Jack in the Box,25,Jack in the box is your standard fast food. Honestly I would never eat there  but it is my favorite hangover remody.
Jack in the Box,26,Awful. Just awful  In the bad way if you couldn t tell from my one star .  I ve been there on a late night snack run three times now  so I m basing this review on multiple experiences because I m fair like that.  I don t care how good or bad the food is if the slackawads  TM  that work there can t get a simple order right.    The first time I went   the worker asked me to hand my bag back to him and proceeded to stick his hand in and pull some hash browns out while saying   Oops.  You didn t order hash browns did you   and letting out a stoner s chuckle.  When I arrived home I began pulling food out of my bag only to discover his reach into the bag had flipped my fries over and pulled half of the wrapper off of my sandwich.    Surely that was a fluke.  WRONG.  I went back again a couple of weeks later and they botched my order again.  Once more  the person taking the orders seemed like he had an IQ of an even 100.  Ever met anyone like that   They re the people who work at this Jack In the Box.  Aside from the watery soft drink  my fries were cold and I was given a Jumbo Jack instead of  the Ultimate Cheeseburger that I deserve.  I won t bore you by going over a third  similar experience I had there.  Just save your money and frustration and travel a mile further down the road to Wendy s  or around the corner to Whataburger.

Jack in the Box,27,went there last night after a 5 hr bus trip. food was ok  staff was less than friendly. every table was dirty and when i sarcastically asked for a towel to wipe the table  i was given one  maybe i shouldn t have asked. when i went to the bathroom  there was water  or urine  all over the floor  felt like i was in a bar bathroom at closing time. also there was an employee in there  i waited for him  that finished his business and just walked out. when i confronted the asst mgr about this  i was told she would look into it and she walked off.
Jack in the Box,28,The staff were friendly and the service was good. But seeing the manager drop my chicken on the floor  pick it up off the floor  then reach into the box of frozen chicken for more to drop severely degraded my score. That added to my wife s cold hamburger made the visit less than stellar at best. Will not return.
Jack in the Box,29,this jack in the crack has a really cool atmosphere. new building new everything. and the sirlion burger with grilled onions is not bad for a fast food restaurant. mmmm
Casita Vizuet,1,No food pun this time that s just cheesy   Highlights   Machetes  Aguas Frescas   Huge Portions   Review  They have a very extensive menu that would satisfy any palate. I ordered a machete with half flor de calabaza  squash blossom  and the other campechano  which is a mixture of beef steak and chorizo . Both the sides had nice texture and flavors. But the star was the machete which had hints of smokiness from the charred chorizo  slight saltiness from the steak  delicious melted cheese  slight bitterness from the squash blossom and all layered on to a pan fried handmade tortilla. It was all washed down with a semi sweet and very refreshing Melon  Cantaloupe  agua fresca. Can t wait to go back and try out their other food options.   Rating  10 10  Machete half campechano  beef steak and chorizo  half flor the calabaza  Squash Blossom - 18 inch long quesadilla made with a handmade tortilla and stuffed with cheese and  preferred protein. It comes with rice  beans  salad and avocado.
Casita Vizuet,2,This is a nice little taco stand that sits just off of Lamar Boulevard. It does help to have a knowledge of the Spanish language since nothing is in English on the menus. They do have three tables enclosed in plastic if you want to dine at this location. They also wear masks and gloves. They have been at this location for about two years. I ordered the beef burrito without the cream and when I looked inside it had two slices of avocado and freshly cut vegetables. It was definitely one of the best beef burritos I ve ever had made fresh to order wrapped in a tortilla that is also made to order. They also sell some drinks but that list is not posted. Basically this little food truck that serves up some darn good food at a reasonable price which makes it an undiscovered little jewel off the main road.
Casita Vizuet,3,Surprising amount of choices. I got the comically large machete and do not regret it. The group of people I went with liked their food too.
Machetes Doa Leova,1,On the search for some birria tacos  I stumbled upon Machetes  Do a Leova . I had never had a machete but when I saw that they had a BIRRIA MACHETE on the menu I had to try it for myself. My boyfriend and I ended up ordering a birria machete and a tinga de pollo gordita. First  the birria machete was so delicious  flavorful and HUGE. The birria was nice and seasoned  without being too salty  which happens quite frequent with birria . Came with some yummy green salsa  red salsa  cebolla curtidas  my favorite  and radishes    Wow it felt like I was back home in MX. The gordita was really good  the chicken tinga was very flavorful and i appreciated that the gordita texture wasn t to thick  personal preference . It is a little pricy but the quality and the amount of meat they stuff in them makes up for it   Will definitely be coming back to try their other items 
Machetes Doa Leova,2,Hmmm I m confused about these poor reviews. These were some of the best tacos I ve ever had. Lots of good flavors  and quality ingredients. Will definitely be back.
Machetes Doa Leova,3,First off  please be aware that they only accept cash  there is a Wells Fargo atm a few blocks down the road .   16 for a birria machete seems overpriced to me especially because there was little cheese and the texture resembled more of a soggy quesadilla. Definitely not worth the price.   We also ordered two tacos. I started eating one and after the first bite noticed a strange mark on the tortilla. It turned out that the heat of the caused somehow loosened the ink on the blue checkered paper the tacos were wrapped in. The ink transferring to the tortilla didn t affect the flavor but I doubt most people would be ok with eating ink.   The beef was meh. Not bad but nothing exciting. Absolutely would not order tacos from this place again and most definitely not worth the  3 they charged for each taco.  If you want great tacos  I highly recommend  tacos de suadero  Tacos El Charly food truck half a mile down the road.   Lastly  they gave us two salsas. A red one that was medium hot - tasted a lot like enchilada sauce. The other salsa was extremely hot  which is fine with me  but I m not a big fan of creamy green salsas as they seem more Tex-Mex  judging from what I ve had in Mexico City  Puebla and every other place I ve ever had green salsa at... and it s in the hundreds . It s as if it had more crema sour cream than avocado.   I ll be keeping an eye out for other places that offer machetes. In the mean time if you want to try their machetes  go with a friend and split one. Although I find the price to be too high for a food truck  unless it s a lobster roll    the portion is good for two people.
Machetes Doa Leova,4,This  8 Pastor Burrito was filled with meat  It was an interesting touch having the vegetables on the side to eat as you please. I ll definitely stop by again to try out the other items. Cash only
Machetes Doa Leova,5,very poor quality food. I was excited to eat some tacos  but the chicken was undercooked and unseasoned. the machete was not cut in half and soggy.  35 for a machete  four bad chicken tacos and two sodas.
Machetes Doa Leova,6,This is where you thr best Machetes in Austin.  They are huge and full of meat. Be sure to bring someone to help eat it. mine last for 2 days. so good.
Machetes Doa Leova,7,I had a carne asada machete with hot Cheetos . The carne wasn t very good . The hot Cheetos were stale the tortilla was stale . Not good at all
TaConMaye Mexican Foodtruck,1,Wow. Amazing tacos.   I had the asada tacos. My wife had the chicken.   Both the asada and chicken had the perfect crispiness  Rice and beans are awesome.   Both green and red sauce are awesome. The green sauce works a little better than the red for chicken. Red sauce is better for asada.  I have one suggestion to TaConMaye - start selling your sauces in bottles to go    It is better than almost anything at H.E.B 
TaConMaye Mexican Foodtruck,2,Was able to try this delicious Mexican food truck during the Georgetown PoppyFest. We ordered the Birria tacos and they were amazing  The salsas were medium hot level  but the tacos had plenty of flavor all on their own as well. Enough food with the 3 tacos to share with another person and feel good. I personally would order my own next time so that I can enjoy more of it. I enjoyed that they had a smaller menu to choose from so you don t get overwhelmed by choices and they clearly have perfected the options they offer.   The wait was pretty short  only about 10 minutes and we had piping hot and fresh food. The presentation alone was almost too gorgeous to eat  but well worth absolutely destroying it to consume. Excited to try the others menu options from them soon 
TaConMaye Mexican Foodtruck,3,Went to the Lakeline Location  Customer service was great. Food not so good asada tacos were a good 4 5 to much fat in the meat and big pieces.   The pastor looked like chorizo 1 5  Never seen purple onion on tacos which they had. Salsas are lacking flavor  Not worth 30 
TaConMaye Mexican Foodtruck,4,Best street tacos. Period. The only bad thing I can say about this place is that they are not open during the week. If you want authentic  Mexican street tacos  you gotta try this place. Additionally  the nachos portion is huge 
TaConMaye Mexican Foodtruck,5,Went to the location in the lakeline mall. Been here multiple times since it opened. I won t ever come back. The child working had the worst work ethic. Refusing to give us salsa for our two dinner because he didn t want to refill them. Then his attitude on top of it- clearly does not want to work here- in the most obvious way. He should be fired. He s not worth  5 an hour
TaConMaye Mexican Foodtruck,6,Yummy tacos and nachos. Located in a nice outdoor food truck area that has occasional live music.
TaConMaye Mexican Foodtruck,7,Finally stopped by this food truck court and went with TaConMaye for my meal and it did not disappoint  Al Pastor Street tacos were AMAZING and their green salsa was also fantastic with just the right amount of spicy-ness  I will definitely be back 
TaConMaye Mexican Foodtruck,8,Best birria tacos I ve ever had  The consume was so flavorful  I just wish there was more   The green salsa was very good  perfect level of heat. I will definitely be getting more of these 
TaConMaye Mexican Foodtruck,9,Just whipped into this food truck for a taco. I always like the taxis that have many ingredients in them that are all chosen by the chef. Pick your own ingredients tacos..... I do that at home all the time. I don t want to pay for what I can make at home. Holy cow. The vaquero breakfast taco was crazy good. Now seeing other reviews  I cannot wait to try their lunch tacos.
TaConMaye Mexican Foodtruck,10,So glad we got to check this place out it s literally 5 mins from us and has outdoor seating surrounded by a few other food trucks. They were very busy and only had two ppl working and they had so much patience with everyone. We don t eat meat and there s a vegan soy protein option that is phenomenal. Our non-veggie friend got the vegan plate  2 tacos  beans and rice  and loved it. We had a torta which was prob one of the best ones I ve ever had. Also ordered some veggie nachos which could have had more vegetables  beans  and cheese on it. Next time I ll ask for extra everything or maybe even get the vegan meat on it. Will def be back 
TaConMaye Mexican Foodtruck,11,We probably come here once a week since we live a mile down the street. So satisfying and so delicious. My partner always craves it and I don t mind it at all  Love 
TaConMaye Mexican Foodtruck,12,Really good Mexican food  They offer tacos  burritos  tortas  and quesadillas all from one truck  My torta came really thick  filled with lots of different meats and plenty of avacado. Juicy  flavorful  kind of messy  and spicy goodness  The prices are reasonable too.  The truck is located at the back side of a new food truck park off the highway. The new food truck park includes a good amount of picnic tables. The park includes maybe two or three more food trucks when we went  only one other was open at that time. Gorgeous fairy lights hang up overhead illuminating the area at night.
TaConMaye Mexican Foodtruck,13,I ve been here a few times because we LoVE the South fork food truck park in Georgetown. It s a great set up with outside seating  a playground for the kids  and delicious food trucks and drinks. I always get the nachos. They re awesome with lots of toppings and delicious cheese. Tonight  I also had the carne asada tacos which came with two tacos filled to the brim with delicious meat. Super solid tacos. Will also absolutely be back again and again.
TaConMaye Mexican Foodtruck,14,Stopped by South Fork for Sunday brunch and decided getting main dish from TaConMaye. We ordered up a fully loaded veggie burrito.  Quite delicious and the one burrito was large enough for both of us.
TaConMaye Mexican Foodtruck,15,Really great food  We got 4 tacos  2 hicken  1 carne asada  and 1 vegan  plus some chips and queso. Chips and queso were very yummy  The chicken and carne asada tacos were top notch. The vegan taco blew my mind a bit. Outstanding. You can t go wrong here 
TaConMaye Mexican Foodtruck,16,This place is bomb  for some good tacos. Their portions are good and the tacos are GREAT    Carnitas is where it s at 
TaConMaye Mexican Foodtruck,17,We were going to place a large order for my daughters swim team  maybe 30 tacos and some fixings. Website says open at 11. We drove from Leander to check it out and it wasn t even opened yet. It s 11 30 and when I called a woman told me they were opening sometime before noon. This is literally the one aspect I hate regarding food trucks.   I ll update when I get to taste it sometime.
TaConMaye Mexican Foodtruck,18,Really good food  I tried the Vaquero and the sausage taco  amazing flavor the size was really good too   I was so hungry that a forgot to take a photo  Thank you chef   I ll be back 
TaConMaye Mexican Foodtruck,19,Never have I ever had better CONSISTENT great food  and I m not just talking Mexican food or breakfast tacos or food truck status.  I have been here at least a dozen times and almost every time I try something different off the menu.  I have NEVER been disappointed.  The truck is primarily run by two guys.  Both very nice and make delicious food.  So here s what makes this truck stand stand out.  1. Calling it simply food truck food is an insult.  This is amaze ballz food. 2. The main chef works hard to please by being accommodating to requests. 3.  Nothing feels or tastes generic. 4.  Taconmaye rests between hidden gem and up and coming. 5.  There is love in every meal. 6.  It s an effort truck  meaning you can t just show up after work.  The hours are early and close well before sundown.  I can go on and on about the food at Taconmaye.  You really have to try for yourself.  The wait is not long so it s still early in the game for the chefs to dish out some amazing dishes with tender loving care.  Definitely one of the best.
TaConMaye Mexican Foodtruck,20,The portions are huge for the nachos and quesadillas  and the tacos are generously filled. I love the food and friendly service this food truck offers.
TaConMaye Mexican Foodtruck,21,This is a mixed review. My tacos were definitely legit Mexican St tacos. I had the al carbon and brisket. Pork and brisket were seasoned very well with a hint of spiciness. Green chili sauce gave it the required kick.   Plus One ordered pork nachos. Plenty of chips and the right amount of cheese but where s the meat  In all honesty there was maybe a spoonful of meat on a large plate. Fail  I was going to head back to the truck but was persuaded not to. Their tacos were AOK but I still prefer the taco truck at 183 and Spicewood Springs by Jim s.
TaConMaye Mexican Foodtruck,22,BEST TACOS IN TOWN     And I am SO picky  my boyfriend and I literally got chills when we took our first bite of our tacos because they were just so amazing   A little of Mexico with authentic Mexican food located in Georgetown.   Who would ve thought   WE ARE SO HAPPY   
TaConMaye Mexican Foodtruck,23,Oh my oh my  I stopped for gas at the Exxon station at South Bell Blvd. and Riviera Dr on the Austin Cedar Park border  frontage road of 183A heading south  on a very cold  windy yet sunny day and I m so glad I did  After getting gas  I went over to the TacoMaye food truck parked along the side of the parking lot near a few picnic tables and a shaded grass area.  The menu isn t diverse  but offers standard breakfast tacos  egg and...  and about 8 lunch taco choices  a few other staples like burritos  quesadilla s  nachos  tortas  etc.   I had the chicken taco with onion  cilantro  cheese and avocado on a warm flour tortilla with a side of green sauce that perfectly complimented the fire grilled chicken  onions and zesty cilantro. The generous helping of shredded Monterey Jack and the creamy avocado wedge helped to balance out the heat. The green sauce was just the right heat  too  I m still feeling it as I type this- my upper lip is sweating slightly my tongue is tingling and my sinuses are clear-  but even without a beverage  this meal didn t feel like I would die from capsaicin heat.   The next taco I ordered was the brisket  cheese  onion and cilantro on warm  house made corn tortillas. I thought I d had some good tacos before but Wow  The brisket was flavorful and seasoned just right  not greasy  but slightly crispy and cut into manageable bite sized bits. It drives me nuts when you bite into your taco and all the meat comes out in one big piece   And praise needs to be given to those glorious flat rounds of sun drenched corn turned into soft  delectable tortillas. Made in a normal TACO size  not in the smaller fajita style  and doubled up  too  I could eat them with melted butter all day long  Order the corn     Each taco is  2.50  The vegetarian taco is  1.00 more  and well worth it and even worth standing in the cold sunshine for a little over five minutes  too   Thanks TACOMAYE  I ll be seeing you again and soon 
TaConMaye Mexican Foodtruck,24,We had delicious carne asada tacos and a chicken quesadilla from this food truck at Red Horn brewery. Everything was fresh and super delicious  The quesadilla was grilled perfectly and was so cheesy. I can t wait until they are even closer when the new Red Horn in Leander opens up. Will definitely order again 
TaConMaye Mexican Foodtruck,25,Thank you for a hot delicious vegetarian meal  First Mexican food in a long time and it did not disappoint  We had the vegetarian Taco Plates that came with two homemade sauces. The helpings were generous and tasty. Refried beans and Mexican rice were included. The price was inexpensive but quality and taste was not cheap     Called in order and it was ready at the time of my arrival. Also appreciated the precautions and steps taken by the entire group to ensure safety of customers. Thank you for being gloved and masked and let me prepay through PayPal. Made the whole transaction super smooth and comfortable.   Can t wait for the next meal 
TaConMaye Mexican Foodtruck,26,Stopped here for a little lunch  ended up with two stacked carne asada tacos. They asked me if I wanted a fork when I picked up my order and I thought to myself  who needs a fork with a taco  I didn t realize at the time how much meat they put on them  Get the fork  Good food and a really great play area with other trucks serving different food  desserts  and drinks. Nice cold beer at the Box Bar next door.
TaConMaye Mexican Foodtruck,27,Carne Asada Lunch Taco Average for the    30 for 2 plate lunch  Especially from a food truck. I probably will not return.
TaConMaye Mexican Foodtruck,28,Best vegetarian quesadilla  The vegetables were fresh  right amount of cheese and it was not greasy. It was sooo good  Great food
TaConMaye Mexican Foodtruck,29,We moved to Georgetown several months ago and kept hearing about Tacomaye food truck...well we finally tried it.  Delicious.  Flavor was so good  meat so tender  i am not crazy about rice but bous theirs was good.  They had a limited menu the day we orderd....so good I guess they sold out of some stuff...so go early   We will be back 
TaConMaye Mexican Foodtruck,30,The best of the best  Tacos  Nachos  and Quesadillas to die for. I personally love the Al Pastor. You can get the Gringas which is Al Pastor with avacado. But honestly everything they make is so good. I not only have I been to the truck at multiple breweries and events and had them career my work event. They always deliver great quality food with great toppings and all their meat options are super good.
TaConMaye Mexican Foodtruck,31,Very friendly truck. Fast service. The brisket quesadilla is incredible. Cheese for dayssssss.
TaConMaye Mexican Foodtruck,32,Friendly staff and great tacos  I got brisket tacos. The meat was tender and tasted great.
TaConMaye Mexican Foodtruck,33,This place is excellent. Super nice workers. My kids were fighting over their breakfast quesadilla they we sharing and they ate every bite even though it was giant. We can t wait to come back and try more things.
TaConMaye Mexican Foodtruck,34,The food here is phenomenal  They have tons of great options to choose from PLUS a vegan vegetarian option. I got the quesadilla and added bell peppers and I also tried the vegan  soy meat  taco  It was delicious. My husband tried the brisket taco and a carne asada taco and he says it was  amazing . We will definitely come back often. The service was awesome also  he seemed like he really cared about his customers and his food. Over all  a wonderful experience  can t say enough good things 
TaConMaye Mexican Foodtruck,35,Best tacos in Georgetown I couldn t get a picture cause I ate them too fast. Fast fresh and as authentic as you can get. The chef knows what he s doing
TaConMaye Mexican Foodtruck,36,With all of the Mexican food options in the greater Austin area  I would most certainly look to satisfy your cravings elsewhere. I was terribly disappointed with my experience overall  especially after reading so many positive reviews.  I ordered two tacos  ground beef and al pastor  and a carne asada quesadilla. All three menu items were incredibly greasy. Specifically for the tacos  all I could taste was oil and very little seasoning. Much to my dismay  the tortillas were not fresh and only one tiny hot sauce sample was provided for my entire order  which was absolutely neccessary to help flavor the dull meat. I did receive more when I asked  but considering the size of the meal  I don t understand the rationale behind the amount provided.  The quesadilla was the most unsatisfactory item of the order. There was entirely too much cheese and a laughable amount of carne asada in the fold. I could probably fit all of the meat in half of the palm of my hand. The was a single dollop of sour cream on just one of the slices of the three piece order  and just a drop of pico - enough to dress a single bite. My problem with this is that the menu mentioned that these condiments topped the quesadilla. Sure  I suppose you can get away with saying that if you stack three pieces on top of each other....  0 
TaConMaye Mexican Foodtruck,37,My boyfriend and I stopped by this food truck the other day and am so glad we did   We both got the Carne Asada taco. I ordered as well a brisket  egg and cheese breakfast taco while my boyfriend also ordered a chorizo egg  potato and cheese taco  They are good portions and are very flavorful  We will def be back to have some more 
TaConMaye Mexican Foodtruck,38,Best taco place in cedar park    They were so big and tasty  They make it really fast. They were all good but my favorite was the  barbacoa.
TaConMaye Mexican Foodtruck,39,I stopped by after work last week to grab a burrito. I requested steak but I received a burrito full mostly of beans  rice  amp  cheese. The burrito was huge but only 2 bites had any steak. Taco Bell gives their customers a bigger portion of meat in their burritos lol. Should of known that I was going to be shorted after the guy processing my order just stared at his IPad after processing my CC order. I didn t tip  amp  heard laughter while i looked inside my burrito. I looked over  amp  saw both men who were working watching me look at the toppings. I told one of the guys there that there wasn t much steak in my burrito. He just looked at the ground  amp  walked off. I definitely will never be coming back to this place. I can t believe they would treat their customers like that. If you go there  remember to tip lol
TaConMaye Mexican Foodtruck,40,Absolutely LOVE their food.  So fresh  so much flavor. 10 10 highly recommend.  Order the carne Asada tacos      You won t regret it. If you can get out to Southfork it s the best place to bring the kids 
TaConMaye Mexican Foodtruck,41,We work at the dealership right next door and this guy never disappoints for breakfast tacos 
TaConMaye Mexican Foodtruck,42,Wow that was a great breakfast taco. I had chorizo and cheese. Really great salsa and tortilla.
TaConMaye Mexican Foodtruck,43,Super yummy food  Authentic Mexican food  I haven t tried anything I don t like  We also use them for catering our work meetings for breakfast or lunch 
TaConMaye Mexican Foodtruck,44,At Rentsch Brewery in April...half of us had gotten sick from eating the food...even 3 children under the age of 3...terrible quality
TaConMaye Mexican Foodtruck,45,Food here was great   Order wasn t made correctly.  I said I d take them  amp  not to worry about it   I didn t really care too much  they both were good .   I guess he checked the order ticket because the cook showed up with the correct taco at no charge.  I told him he did not have to do that  amp  I would pay for it.  He declined  amp  said it was no problem.
TaConMaye Mexican Foodtruck,46,Indulged in some tacos for Taco Tuesday at Whitestone Brewery. I ordered 2 carne asada and 1 pastor taco. Seriously some of the best tacos I ve ever had and definitely the best pastor I ve ever had. I can t wait to try more from their menu 
TaConMaye Mexican Foodtruck,47,I had two brisket tacos  and one bacon egg and cheese. Friendly owner  and tasted amazing. I will definitely be back.
TaConMaye Mexican Foodtruck,48,I ordered the Torta al pastor. And a Carne Asada Taco. He gave me a Al pastor taco instead I was too hungry to care . The Torta was average nothing special   and the Taco was a generic Taco as well. However I did like the green salsa. Would I go back to this taco truck   Probably not.
TaConMaye Mexican Foodtruck,49,These Tacos are the bomb  the menu is limited but it is a taco truck.  I highly recommend the tacos de barbacoa on corn tortilla.
Taco Fresco,1,Stopped by for some breakfast tacos and they were so delicious  The meat is so tender and the flavor is on point. The salsas go well with the tacos. Will be back to try their regular tacos soon 
Taco Fresco,2,WHOA.. I just stopped here for a gordita  as the sign on the fence indicated that they had  Authentic  ones.. so I  after having seen that TACO sign on the side of the Shell Gas station for YEARS  decided to take a walk on the wild side and try a gas station meal.  I thought  well  I will start with a bean and cheese gordita and secretly hoped that they would have shredded cabbage and sour cream.. after all  the sign does say  Authentic .  When I walked in  I expected to see a big window for ordering or some portion of the interior of the gas station to be designated for the Taco Shop.. but nope.. just a small glass case with pre-made tacos of varied filling.. But in the back of the case  I spotted a gordita shaped foil form.. and noticed  beyond the case a door opening up to a kitchen that was in full swing... A huge pot of masa.. a big grill  lots of stacks of pots and pans.. This IS the real deal  I thought to myself.. One of the two ladies working the kitchen came out to greet me and I asked if I could have a bean and cheese gordita.  She quickly began getting my elements together.. the fresh  uncut  gordita.. at that point  I thought.. Weeelll... If they are this legit  I wonder if I could ask for nopales inside.. she  in a smooth move  a salesperson can surely appreciate  offered me  instead  any one of 6 or 8 other fillings as she lifted lids of the stainless steel catering trays filled with options... Beef picadillo  which I went with   tripe  fajitas  barbacoa  etc.. So  I ended up with beans  cheese  beef picadillo.. I grabbed some shredded lettuce  sliced and pickled fresh jalapenos  the 3 salsa options  have to figure out which one I was going to like best  and some sour cream..  The man at the counter was very welcoming and gave me the back story on the taco business that had occupied that space for many years trough a couple of operators.    At last  I tell you about the flavor.. GOOD.. I decteded a tiny touch of cinnamon or something.. So good. the gordita itself was just right.. and the favorite salsa.. hard to say but prolly the red.. it was really rich and flavorful.. go.. soon..
Taco Fresco,3,Great place for breakfast tacos and gorgitas. Great salsas and condiments. Will cook whatever you want if not already in the grab-and-go section. This is my spot for tacos 
Taco Fresco,4,This hidden gem has great breakfast tacos and delicious agua fresca. My personal fav is the cantaloupe agua fresca  but watermelon and pineapple are good too.  Great place to stop while you fighting the morning drive into the city.
Taco Bell,1,This location is truly head and shoulders above many other T-Cabs in town  Josh and Cindy will take care of you and handle any issues  GREAT BEAN AND CHEESE TACOSSSS   
Taco Bell,2,Went at 6 05.  Not crowded inside.  Only a few staff workers.  Took a very long to get our fast food.  First  we did not get our drink cups.   All four soft and hard tacos had about a teaspoon of meat.   Two soft tacos were ordered with no cheese and no lettuce.  Did not get them that way.  The taco fries were cold.  The cheesy potatoes were chewey and cold.   I understand the long wait caused by Uber Dash and other delivery services.  Taco Bell puts these services ahead of inside customers.  But  the food was poor even by fast food standards.  Also  you HAD to use the digital app  no counter sales.  Got a refund.
Taco Bell,3,If you added up the IQ of everyone working at once at this location it would be a shock if it exceeded twenty points. Might as well be self-service. Places like this are why there will never be minimum wage increases.
Taco Bell,4,In door dining is closed for no reason  no sign on the door just locked doors with drive through open.
Taco Bell,5,wish i could give less than 1 star  seems like they re extremely understaffed and the people they do have working there are at their wits end. typically takes 45 minutes to get food  they re extremely rude over the intercom. i asked for 2 separate tickets and i hear in the background this woman scream  NO        she then takes over the intercom and explains that they aren t doing separate tickets. i said ok and proceeded to order and could barely stop to breathe without the cashier barking  what else     it was so off-putting and weird that we just left mid order and went to a different location. please get more staff here  pay your workers better  and maybe replace some of these folks. awful awful location  avoid at all costs.
Taco Bell,6,Waited over an hour 20 mins in line to order through the drive through. Took about 1.5hours to get through the line and pull out with my food. Thought it was a one-off thing.. it s not. Showed up about a week later  waited about 25 mins the line literally didn t move once. Only time it moved was when people were driving off  leaving the line. If you are showing up in line after dark  you can expect to wait minimum 45 mins to put your order in. Another 30 mins to actually get to the window. I would also suggest checking everything before pulling away from the window because you are screwed if they mess up the order- as the inside is always closed.
Taco Bell,7,I m pretty sure the entire staff is on drugs.    Every  time we order from this location  the results are something out of the twilight zone.   Examples include   - Soft drinks that are 100  void of syrup.   Just carbonated water. - A  chicken quesadilla  that s literally just an uncut tortilla folded in half.  No cheese  chicken  sauce -- nothing. - A single cinnabon crumpled flatted into a taco wrapper  we ordered a pack of 2  which  should  have come in one of the small sleeves  - Items frequently missing entirely.  Today we got cheese sauce  and no chips  for our  nacho  order. - Things we didn t even remotely order.  They just tossed random things into the bag. - Zero sauce packets  even though they were specifically requested and are listed on the receipt  Whoever manages this location should be utterly ashamed of themselves.
Taco Bell,8,Bowl was good  but had to throw it out halfway when I opened the extra sauce and found a hair in it. Should ve listened to the reviews.
Taco Bell,9,The assistant manager Cameron stayed open for my husband to bring me  his pregnant wife  food at 1am. Absolutely a nice guy and wonderful service. Thank you so much 
Taco Bell,10,I waited over 20 minutes at the drive through ordering kiosk until I finally gave up thinking they forgot about me. I drove up to the window and they refused to serve me because I didn t tell them at the ordering kiosk  at which they ignored me  that I was picking up an order. I said this is ridiculous I m not waiting in line for another half hour of your incredibly poor service - just hand me the bags. They refused and said they would call the cops if I didn t leave. I couldn t believe it so I said call the cops instead of handing me a bag   Then the kid actually called the police and bold faced liar said I was being belligerent and cussing at them. I never did say one cuss word at them and they were being belligerent. I will be making a complaint to corporate headquarters.
Taco Bell,11,Intensely unfriendly  slow  and unhygienic. Wouldn t help at all with questions about the app  took forever to fill a small  simple order  and people working in the kitchen were wearing masks below their noses. It s cheap food that could potentially come at a grave cost. AVOID.
Taco Bell,12,They usually get the food right- most of the time they don t have a specific drink available  I understand the current shortages   but they ve also been recently forgetting the drinks they do have in stock. Kinda disappointing.
Taco Bell,13,Best rice  amp  bean burritos I ve had from a T-Bell.  I got potatoes in it too - usually they re really fried and have no substance to them  but these were solid potatoes.  Everything seemed fresher than I ve had from others.  The service was good too  very quick  amp  the guy was friendly.  And they didn t skimp on the hot sauce either.  I ll be back 
Taco Bell,14,I ordered an order but forgot to say no cheese. I called to make sure they didn t put any on it because I have a milk allergy. I was being polite but the person on the phone was being very rude to me  I have a dairy allergy  Be respectful there was absolutely no reason to be so rude to me.
Taco Bell,15,The drive thru here closes at 1am. Bad enough that they changed it from 2 to 1  but tonight I pulled in at 12 40 which  having worked in the service industry before  I realize is annoying as hell  but sometimes you gotta do it. But I pull in and am told they are  closed . 20 min before they re closed. I said  I thought y all closed at 1  and he says  ....we do. But we already...shut down the system because...we were having issues with it  so...we decided to close . Cool thanks. You could genuinely tell from his tone and the way he hesitated while speaking that he was making sh t up  and knew it was a b tch move. I wouldn t be grumbling about it and I m normally not the type to go around posting petty 1 star reviews. but tonight was one of those nights when I was in a sad spiral  and really looking forward to Taco Bell comfort food. if you close at 1  you close at 1 fam  come on. It s super lame to just decide to close 20 min early because you supposedly don t feel like dealing with your  system . Grumble grumble. Just glad it was already on my route and I hadn t gone out of my way to go there  and hoping this doesn t become a regular thing.  Edit  welp  upon reading past reviews  it looks like this  is a regular thing at this location. Hey TBell  pls get some employees who actually honor the hours of operation. Totally get that it s late and you re 17 yrs old and wanna go home  amp  smoke a blunt  amp  play Xbox Live or whatever  but this is a business. And this is your job. Just do it  it s really not that hard.
Taco Bell,16,Please update your hours of operation on google so people do not waste time driving to your restaurant only to find it closed.
Taco Bell,17,They crunchy tacos actually crunchy  Like frfr I was so damn happy with my tacos being right because in Houston the Taco Bell I go too ALLLLLLLLL the time is fucked up.. never crunchy
Taco Bell,18,Ordered online at midnight since they close at 2AM. Got there at 1 10AM and the screen was off. I pulled up to the window and there were at least two people inside. I waited and then honked my horn to get someone s attention since I had already paid. Nobody came. After repeated honks someone just motioned they were closed. Nobody bothered to say anything prior  hell even put up a sign. Sheer laziness and disregard. Not surprised - just annoyed
Taco Bell,19,Why is your inside closed in the middle of the day  You sign says you are open and should be open. Why not put a simple sign in the door saying the lobby is closed  You only give stupid looks at customers who park and try to walk into the lobby. Here s a hint  the only thing more stupid than your looks is not putting a sign on your door saying the lobby is closed.
Taco Bell,20,if their life depened on it and rhey had to get an order right. they wouldnt get it right and die
Taco Bell,21,Third person inside ordering food and 20 minutes later still no food. Couldn t find order from their own kiosk. Workers walking all around each other  no organization  and no customer service. I wouldn t recommend ever.
Taco Bell,22,If you have any expectation of getting what you actually order  you will be sorely disappointed. Nothing in our order was correct. News flash Taco Bell employees- if a customer customizes their order  it s because that s the way they want the food they pay you to make them. Pay attention  How hard is it    Plus rude employees lying about how the app works. Ridiculous  pathetic  incompetent.
Taco Bell,23,This is where Tacos go to die. This is a dumpster Taco Bell with dumpster quality and service especially at drive thru. Want to eat dumpster undercooked and under served garbage   Then you have come to the right place amigo.
Taco Bell,24,Closed 15 minutes before they were supposed to... not fun to learn when you drove out of the way just to get a taco lol
Taco Bell,25,Waited 30 minutes for my order to be taken. I couldn t leave the drive thru line so I had to stay.
Taco Bell,26,It was just another day  i got hungry so decided to order 2 of their mini chicken quesadillas. I had got home and took a bite in to the first one only to discover a hard object inside my mouth  I spat it out in disgust and saw what it was. A dirty fingernail. I immediately lost my appetite and called them. The only response I got was   Well  you re gonna need to bring it over here so we can see for ourselfs.  Okay  first of all. I drove to that resturaunt and home  I m NOT going all the way over there to show them their mistakes. I think I m taking a break from taco bell.
Taco Bell,27,Long time Taco Bell supporter  yes  I know when the 7-layer burrito used to be  0.99   1.29   1.39  etc    I also know when the  Cheesy Gordita Crunch  first came out  possibly an embarrassed admission   Lol .  Used to know the manager of this store  who advanced to District  then Regional  and now beyond  Rick - you were da bomb  . All I can say as of today is  STAY AWAY from this Taco Bell  I don t know who s in charge  but not only from this day s attempt but also a former attempt that resulted in incorrect order and seriously poor food quality   underweight in size. If you are doing the drive-thru  be sure you check your order BEFORE you drive away. I m 2 for 2 in receiving an incorrect order of only 2 items  Didn t complain before because I didn t notice until I arrived at my destination. This time  I waited thru the line again and didn t even get an apology. This location has taken a serious nose-dive in every aspect. Oh  but they still start the drive-thru question with   How are you    Um  doesn t matter how I am and I know you don t care - I m just here to place an order... Sorry  if that s a Taco Bell  thing   but I find it annoying when all I want to do is order . And when I end my order with   and that is ALL   WHY do you come back with   And would you like to add a drink with that   I don t care about scripted responses  one should LISTEN to the customer     Frustrated. But more angry with 2 consecutive incorrect orders and no apology when I had the time to go back and get what I wanted  ordered  and paid for. I m absolutely dying to hear a reply from this manager or regional  I think y all  need  to - this location currently SUCKS 
Taco Bell,28,I have a deep  long  loving history with Taco Bell. We go way back. Remember when you could get a Mexican pizza with green onions  Oh yeah. I m an OG.  This Taco Bell is pretty good. The food is always good and the restaurant is always clean  I loved the old staff a lot  they were personable  nice  and just really good people. It s different  now  which is why I m giving this location 3 stars.   Tonight  the girl taking our order was rude. She stood at the register with an  Are you going to order or what   look on her face  instead of asking if we were ready to order. This is becoming a thing with people lately. I might be getting old  where are their manners  I digress.  Another phrase of the Elders.   I told her my order  a steak cantina bowl  and she typed it into the keyboard and just stared at me. I looked at Husbae  because I was done with my portion of the order. As he began to answer  she kept looking at me and interrupted him by rudely saying   Is that it     It was a very awkward experience. The food was good. I just miss the old staff.
Taco Bell,29,Terrible service. For the past few days  or more  the pink lemonade has been out. They literally gave me water in the drive thru and charged us for it  not to mention the girl taking cash in the first window said NOTHING to us. When I went back inside  they pretty much refused to change the pink lemonade syrup. I ve worked in the industry. I know all about soda machines. It s laziness at its finest.   The pregnant manager was extremely rude to me and didn t once try to resolve the situation. As a non soda drinker due to reactions with carbonation  I have very few options.   I love Taco Bell. I really have had it with this shit staff  It shouldn t take 20 minutes in the drive through at 2pm to get this kind of  service  
Taco Bell,30,Let me start by saying  I rarely eat fast food  mostly due to the lack of nutritional value as well as the quality of both the preparation and the  food  itself. When I do though  I tend to go with Mexican or a burger  depending what s most convenient and how much I ve had to drink.  Having been to this Taco Bell a few times  with the same unfavorable result  I recently found myself craving a good ol  fashion crispy taco. Upon arrival to the drive through  as usual  my eyes instantly become bigger than my stomach as I viewed the menu and realized I could get so many items for so little. But then I instantly am reminded that the food NEVER looks as it does on the menu board. That being said  you at least expect to get the items you ordered ie  chicken on a chicken bowl or cheese on a combo burrito  both of which we realized we didn t get after we returned home.  Unfortunately service here isn t much better than the food. Taco Bell management needs to take a trip through a Chick-fil-A or Bush s Chicken to understand what I m talking about.  Again  I realize it s fast food and not a Michelin Star restaurant  however give a smile  act like you appreciate my business and give me what I paid for 
Taco Bell,31,I ve been here multiple times - I ve only left happy once. I ve gone in and stood around  and then sat around  and spent 25 minutes waiting for food. If I wanted to wait  I d go to a sit-down restaurant where a waiter comes to my table.   I ve started going through the drive thru so i can at least choose the music selection  and because it s a tad bit faster.   Maybe 1 person knows how to take orders without sounding like a complete arse. I ve never seen an employee here smile. I m starting to think this is a franchise location and corporate can t do much  because I ve complained plenty to corporate and they just send me a coupon. There is something wrong with this location. I ve been to many Taco Bells in my lifetime..and no Taco Bell as disappointed me as much as this one. I feel bad for the workers - they re clearly unhappy.   Not only are the people depressing or abrasive  pick your poison I guess    but they really skimp you on the food at this location. Expect your taco to have half of it s normal filling  cold  or to be missing a few ingredients  or all of the above. I ve been handed a bag that was cold in my hand and I figured the sauce was at the bottom and they gave me a lot. NOPE. I got a taco straight out of the freezer. I had to do the most horrible thing you could ever do to Taco Bell food   re heat it in the microwave.   So I m a huge fan of Taco Bell  but I prefer to drive to the one on Burnet near 183 - they re super friendly  my order is usually at least semi-correct  and they don t get cheap on you with the ingredients.
Taco Bell,32, Taco Bell is not real mexican food . It gets the job done for half the price  what s not real mexican about that. And in the case of the new smothered burrito  it gets the job done handsomely. This particular taco bell was clean  looked to be recently remodeled   and not busy. One taco assembler on the line was new and didn t know yet how to make the food  but his trainer did so while it took a few seconds longer than usual all was good.
Taco Bell,33,Great food. Great deals. Delivers on time. Love the skittles drink  and the Mexican pizzas
Taco Bell,34,The worst service of all of the chains  was there tonight  waited 8 minutes in the drive through and no one waited on me  finally drove around to see another car sitting in the window with lights out and someone inside looking down at phone  no one visible inside  another vehicle behind that leg like they also got tired of waiting  backed up and left. I am not coming back to this location  you will waste your time  1 star was too much for this review 
Taco Bell,35, On Oster  On Waring  On Hamilton Beach...   There is the occasional frijole  grain of rice  or scrap of vegetable that narrowly escapes the clutches of the blender  but they are few and far between.  Don t bother looking for the meat  because they are still chasing it through the woods behind the restaurant.  I think if there ever would be a market for Taco Smoothies  this place wouldn t have to change any of their food prep to add them to the menu.  The place is really not that bad  it s just that the food barely passes for  well  food.  And  when you peel back the wrapper and open the tortilla  no matter what you thought you had ordered  the guts inside are pretty much all the same mushy goo of ingredients.  When it comes right down to it  all the Yum  Brands franchises are very much the same in terms of quality and satisfaction.  You eat there because it s fast and convenient  not necssarily because it s good.  I shouldn t take it out just on this location  but it s the closest one to my house.
Taco Bell,36,So slow every time. Zero lack of energy. No consideration of the customers time. Years ago it was fast. Bad management 
Taco Bell,37,Absolutely horrible....35mins to get through drive through....only 5 cars in line. As if the food wasn t bad enough.
Taco Bell,38,I love Taco Bell but this one here is by far the worst one  The cashier Leocadio was rude  disrespectful and has horrible customer service skills  I let the manager know and she had the nerve to tell me that she knows he wouldn t be rude and wouldn t do that. She doesn t even know because she was cleaning the Lobby   I had to go thru the drive through 3 times because first they forgot something that I ordered and then I went back through because a combo I order was all wrong and the third time was because I wanted to let the manager know what happened but that didn t do any good so I asked her for the district manager s name. I get it if the cashier was having a bad day or it was busy all at once but you dont treat your customers like shit  This is why I give this Taco Bell 1 star
Taco Bell,39,Food was ok  I asked for Jalapenos  and I was given 3 slices   and charged extra for them     3   are you kidding...ok then we asked for Verde sauce and give 2..    Then we asked for more  for three orders of food  they looked at us like we were from Mars. I mean are the employees paying for the condiments themselves ....
Taco Bell,40,I visited this location tonight  as I do many nights. The first guy we talked to was friendly and polite. He told us they were short staffed and it would take about 15 minutes for our food which was okay with us. However the second lady we talked to was rude  short   and unfriendly. Our food was tossed to us and no offer of sauce was given. Upon driving home we noticed that the Baja blast was all soda water  no flavor and undrinkable. Once we got home the crunch wrap supreme was missing half the hard shell and the cheese was all on one side.
Taco Bell,41,I m not expecting gourmet food when I go to a Taco Bell  generally I m here for speed and convenience.  I really never thought to review it even though I probably went here a couple times a month.  This last visit on Saturday changed that.  I found  by biting into  a ten inch strip of plastic in my Taco Supreme.  It looked liked it came off a plastic bag of some kind.  The really disturbing part is it does not appear to be something the employee would miss due to size  leaving me to think it was out in the food intentionally.  Totally disgusting and the last time I eat at any Taco Bell.  I filed a complaint with the city and saved the remaining part and non-food item in it.  When I called and reported this to the manager he told me   Come back and we will remake your taco.  No thanks dude.  I also emailed Taco Bell on Monday but they did not respond.  Avoid  folks  unless you like eating things that are not food.
Taco Bell,42,So  I dont usually do this kind of thing  but I feel like I need to warn everyone. I know Taco Bell usually gets a bad rap for being rough on the stomach  but this is ridiculous. Ever since my late night snack at this location last night  I ve been married to my toilet.   Seriously reconsider stopping by late at night  as its pretty obvious proper care wasn t exercised with food safety on my order. I ve never had a case of food poisoning this bad.
Taco Bell,43,If anyone in Austin visits Taco Bell and orders the new  Cantina  tacos  please send in your Austin  TX citizenship card.  Mine is in the mail.   The carnitas  Cantina  taco was a soggy piece of crap. Seriously  just go to one of our many taquerias.   And Justin  Taco Bell cashier  here s how it works. I come up to the counter  you stop whatever you are doing and greet me with a friendly  Welcome to Taco Bell  May I take your order   or something along those lines. What you should not do  is glance at me  say nothing  walk to the back  and when you return give me a creepy yet vacant stare while holding the cash register with both hands. That s how people mistake you for a sociopath  Got it  OK  great. Work on those people skills  buddy.  Two stars because I am forever enamored with the bean burritos   extra onions - my college drunk food of choice.
Taco Bell,44,I m fairly positive that my boyfriend and I both got salmonella from this location during the great tomato scare of 2008. I haven t eaten at a taco bell since. 1 order of nachos supreme   5 days of disgusting misery.  Run for the border  No. Just run. Get away from this place as fast as you can.
Taco Bell,45, It didn t make me sick   haha  I love it   Just what you want to see in a food review.  Exactly  Michelle and Michael  if you live in Austin  or honestly anywhere  then you have literally no excuse for eating at Taco Bell.  With delicious taco stands on every corner at all hours of the night  the only thing sickening about it is how addicted you may become to these affordable AND deliciously authentic treats   Last night  er this morning  I found myself in my car driving to my old neighborhood haunt for some al pastor and puerco verde.  I woke up smiling today  and none-the-broker   And hey  no hepatitis 
Taco Bell,46,I think it you are in a hurry and want something quick.  It is for you.  Not the place for long sit sown meal.
Taco Bell,47,People were rude and snippy. Bean burrito was not right seriously... . My little cherry limeade sparkler was good  sonic is better drink wise.  Otherwise it was taco bell. Didn t make me sick    D
Taco Bell,48,I went in and got a  complicated order  which i paid extra for. But in the end i got the standard item. When i called the manager wanted to argue with me of i ordered and what i got. This is the Second time in a row that they messed up. And they won t own up to their mistake. I can t wait for the day they close down completely.
Taco Bell,49,An ordering miscommunication was fixed immediately. Prompt and professional  Great clean place with friendly employees 
Taco Bell,50,Why did I go here  There were only a couple people in there when I went in. I had a small family in front of me and they ordered quickly. After they ordered we walked up to the counter and the cashier disappeared for almost 5 minutes  without saying anything to us . There were at least 5 people prepping food  none of them are trained as cashiers   We finally placed our order  3 calupas and a drink. It took almost 20 minutes to get our food. I wasn t even going to eat there I wanted it TO GO. The food tastes fine  but it shouldn t have taken 20 minutes  even the people in front of us were waiting for ever.   No one stayed at the counter and people coming in were stuck waiting there for at least 5 minutes. One kid was standing there for almost 10 minutes waiting for someone to come forward. Absolutely terrible.
Taco Bell,51,the lady here didn t take my order for like 5 minutes and that s very mcr00d bye im taking my business elsewhere thank you sike i hate u tako beel
Taco Bell,52,Fast food is always a last resort and I try my best to avoid it but when you re hungry and in a hurry the only option is horrible food that is over priced. Why can t corporations serve healthy food instead of foods that are bad for our health 
Taco Bell,53,Since they reopened the quality has improved drastically  now instead of 100  certainty that the chalupa flatbread will be cold and not toasty like all the other Taco Bells in town it s more like 50  chance that they will be good  I was so shocked when I went back and the chalupa was just perfect like the first time I had them 13 years ago in Chicago. Obviously something happened and they are under new management. Service is better too.
Taco Bell,54,The inside of this taco bell is really dingy  and pretty creepy.  Now the people that have worked the drive through are always very professional. The people that work have worked at the cash register are always rude  sloppy and mess up all my orders.  I would recommend skipping the inside and just doing the drive through.
Taco Bell,55,Even for Taco Bell  this place is one of the worst. The interaction with the employees is just fine. No one is rude. However  the food is terrible  yes  I know  even for Taco Bell. But if you re reading this  you  too  eat there  . The beans are runny  the burritos are smaller than tacos should be  there is rarely any  meat  on whatever you order  the nacho sauce is always less than half filled  they get your order wrong every time ... etc  etc  etc. This is a Taco Bell location to avoid.
Taco Bell,56,This location is pretty close to where I live and I often stop by here for a quick bite.  Personally  I have never had a problem with my orders. Say what you will about the food   it s taco bell-what do you expect   the service here is excellent. The people working here are the nicest I have ever come across at a fast food restaurant. Every time I go to the drive through  which is at various times of the day  the people taking my order are always extremely friendly.  If you re in the mood for a quick taco  this is the place to go.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,1,Perfect location for a lunch stop  No matter how long the line  they re fast  Of course there is the pre order ahead through the app. Lunch team is always on top of the process  fresh meats and veggies. The dining area is clean as well as the drink area. I recommend the pollo asado with corn salsa.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,2,The brown rice was only half cooked and very hard on the teeth. Could not eat more than a few bites because of the raw rice. Had to waste all 3 items we had ordered for our family of 3 and rethink what we had to eat for dinner. Disappointed.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,3,WORST Chipotle I ve ever been to  by far. They were starting to close at 9 35pm when sign says open to 10pm. I would have just left  but hadn t eaten since breakfast  amp  nothing else was open. MOST DISGUSTING burrito I ve ever tasted. Took one bite  brought it back inside   amp  manager gave me a bad attitude. So I just left HORRIBLE BURRITO on the counter  amp  walked out  No food  No refund. The 1 star reviews are accurate. I took a chance thinking  Could it really be that bad   Unfortunately  yes. HORRIBLE  
Chipotle Mexican Grill,4,The only reason I still bother to come to this location is because I live 2 min away. Every time I order  about once a week  the portions get smaller and smaller. This order I got today  attached picture  is the most laughably and pathetically small portion I ve ever recieved at any chipotle ever. Not to mention  it was cold somehow.   To make matters worse  online orders are never ready on time and you always have to either wait  or show up later than your scheduled time.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,5,Understaffed Stressed No in-store ordering  When they do open in-store  they fall behind on on-line orders  Often 45 min behind schedule Staff is scared to complain Morale is low The staff that is there has not gotten the training they need Like the first scene of a Kitchen Nightmares episode No Chips No Iced Tea  Not sure what is happening  but I feel so bad for the staff. All three of them.  Taking a pause on grab and go food for the kiddos until this S-storm passes.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,6,I have enjoyed Chipotle for many years at several different locations but this location is the absolute worst. On a Saturday afternoon there were only 2 people working and there didn t appear to be any management.  One employee in the front was moving slower than molasses and looked like they really didn t want to be there. The other employee  the cook in the back  was at least trying to get things under control as they were coming up to the front to help with orders in between preparing food. Tables weren t wiped down  trash bins were overflowing  and there was no ice in the ice dispenser. They didn t even have music on here which gave the place a dead atmosphere.  By the way as I write this review I still haven t gotten my order after 30 minutes.   I don t blame the employees for this at all. This is a management issue 100 . What a waste of an opportunity for being such a great location.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,7,Never had a problem with a Chipotle until the one. Twice now the restaurant has closed after we ve placing an online order because they are understaffed. They don t bother to close the online ordering on the app for the store so we show up to pick up our food and they say sorry we re closed  like what  They just throw up the corporate number on the door and expect you to handle a refund yourself. Either fix the Chipotle or just close it.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,8,I ve always seen stuff about people getting things in there food that don t belong  I TRULY think it s not chipotles fault  it has to be from shipping or these things are in the bag before. Because how can a whole ass leaf just be thrown in my bowl without notice before cooking  They cook everything so how is it not noticed  Honestly never thought i d be one of those people that gets these type of things in my bowls... going to have to find a new place to replace chipotle
Chipotle Mexican Grill,9,They never have ice tea made and when you order to go or pick up it s not the same as getting it in line... and paying in the store.. they scrimp to go orders and always forget Burrsomething. The food is good but totally inconsistent.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,10,I just stopped in this location to get a simple burrito. The employee did not seem to care how he made my food. I asked for chicken and was given a 1 4  of a spoon full not the usual full scoop when I asked him to put the correct amount on he got really annoyed and walked to the back. I visit this location at least once or twice a week if this is the caliber of employees you hire I ll go elsewhere to spend my money. Young lady at register is always nice  helpful.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,11,First they were only taking online orders and I m really not sure why but ok placed my order online.  Waited pretty much 30 mins altogether to get my food last over other ppl in who I know I did it before them and then their new drink was empty so I asked the cashier if they have anymore and she said they have to make it and she was on her way out so she didn t tell anyone or do it herself so I had to ask again when the whole place was empty and they were able to go back and make some   First time at this location and I more than likely will go somewhere else.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,12,chipotle is the best. this location is horrible. terrible experience 98  of the time. incorrect  sloppy assembly  late  never taking in person cc orders  lock the front doors during open peak hours  unfriendly staff. needs to management on the highest end.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,13,The worst customer experience in my life was at this restaurant. Went in around 1230 on a Saturday and very surprised to see it was empty.  Got in line behind a woman and her son and neither of the 2 people behind the counter said anything to us for a full 5 minutes. When I finally asked if they could wait on us the server told me they were working on online order s and we had to wait. When I protested the fact that we came in person  the woman who was also ignoring us  named Marita  told us we could wait or go elsewhere  when I asked to speak to the manager she said She was the Manager and then ignored me and the other lady in line. After a few minutes the lady in front of me asked how much more time we would need to wait she told they had 2to make 3 more large online orders first They put Chipotle to shame
Chipotle Mexican Grill,14,Ordered online from this location  this is what I received. This is the picture right after I took the lid off. Very dissatisfied Not sure what happened  but someone is fuckinh with me. Do not order online  unless you want someone to eat your plate and then give you the leftovers. This is ridiculous. Wish I could put 0 stars.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,15,Dont order on the app.   Order is wrong as they dont double check.   When you ask them to make it right or refund the order they tell you to call a phone number.    I m right there in the store talking with the  manager  and they dont do anything.    Manager was not interested in making the order right.   Got a carnitas bowl paid in full with no carnitas meat     How does that happen.   Have you even gone to chick-fil-a and your sandwhich has no chicken    Or P-Terry and the burger comes with no burger     After two trips into the store the manager would do nothing.  They already took my money through the app.   Called into the phone number.   Have to wait on hold for over 20 mins.   Get a hold of some one in New Jersey.   They wanted to offer me a 30 day one time discount on my next order.   Did not want to refund me for not getting my order right.   Never use their app it does not save you any time and will cause you much time to get it right in the future.   My wifes order was correct but the amount of chicken they put on her bowl was sad to say the least.    If you go to this location along go in and order yourself to make sure the order is right.   If it is wrong it will be a long disapointing road to get taken care of  if ever.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,16,This chipotle is absolutely terrible. They never get mobile orders right  and the food is never ready on time. My food was supposed to be ready at 1 30 PM. I got there at 1 31 PM and had to wait until 1 47 PM for my food to be made. Mind you  there was only three other people in the entire store and they were all waiting on food orders to go. This is not the first time this has happened  I should ve learned my lesson the first three or four times this happen but I keep giving it another try and every time I am disappointed. Chipotle used to be such a good experience but in the last year or so it has definitely gone way downhill. Additionally  when I did finally get to eat my food it look like someone had sat on it. So disappointing.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,17,Six of us went in for a quick lunch around noon.  When we went to the counter  they told us they were only taking online orders.  So we sat down and started placing an online order.  The manager came to our table and told us that we could not sit in the restaurant and had to leave. There was another person sitting at a table eating his lunch. There was no sign on the door stating that they were closed for in store dining.  The manager made no apology for asking us to leave. I will be taking my business elsewhere in the future.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,18,Big Chipote fan but please stop forgetting things. It s happened multiple times here where something like salad dressing fails to get pushed down the line and I discover it when I get to work... I understand it s a petty complaint but I m going to have to start playing babysitter...
Chipotle Mexican Grill,19,I wish they would pull it together here.  Due to Covid we have been ordering with the app.  So far 3 out of 4 orders have been wrong.    1  All toppings for my burrito were on my wife s bowl.  The only thing correct was the meats.  2  Got the toppings correct but left Guacamole off the bowl...  that s over  2 we were jipped.  3  I ordered a burrito and got a bowl...  WTF get it together      And wife is done as she said there was almost no meat on her bowl.   No consistency     I want to support you  but your quality and attention to detail really in need of improvement   Then the app will let you add reward  birthday guacamole  to the order...  but will not let you check out with it.  For an app that has  what I would consider an excellent user interface  that is a fail big time.  Cheers   Jim
Chipotle Mexican Grill,20,Found a wood chip inside my bowl.... so grossed out and pretty sure I ate wood shavings.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,21,Turns out i am not a chipotle person  it s taken me 7 years of living in America and seeing endless Chipotle tweets   memes to venture into one... maybe I ve been spoiled by taco deli   Maudie s  maybe those are an unfair comparison  I had a rice bowl   my husband had a burrito. It was entirely edible but all tastes a bit cludgy and bland.   It s clean. The servers are friendly. It s not bad. It s just meh. I guess if you like chipotle this one is probably a good one. But I don t.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,22,Never make a phone order. If you call the Yelp number  it will ask you to out in a phone order. It will take your credit card info but then the store will not have a record of the order but WILL CHARGE you anyway.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,23,As a big fan of chipotle and having been to multiple locations in the Austin area  I can truly say this location needs to figure it out. They consistently under deliver when it comes to Food Quality  portion size and customer service. I will gladly take my business to the South Lamar location before I go here. It s unfortunate but I do not recommend this location to anyone in the 78746 and surrounding area codes
Chipotle Mexican Grill,24,Chipotle definitely has the most superior tortilla chips of any Mexican restaurant I ve been to. They have a little bit of a lime taste to it and very salty. Unfortunately  their chips aren t always consistently fresh. I love their medium salsa  the green one  and pico de gallo salsa to pair with the chips. They have a great selection of meat  beans  rice  veggies  salsas  etc. This location is definitely just a take-out kind of restaurant. There was a line when I went at 12 30pm on a weekday but it moved pretty fast  Definitely just a good place to grab lunch to-go. If Torchy s had better chips  I probably wouldn t be frequenting Chipotle as much.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,25,The food was really bad at this location. Underseasoned  sloppily thrown in my bowl. My husband picked up our order and they had it sitting there for 10 minutes before handing it to him. I called to let them know my guacamole was brown and unappetizing and the manager told me I was wrong--that all of it was fresh. You tell me how good that looks to you. I now have to email corporate to get my money back.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,26,Hands down the worst chipotle I have ever had. Not only was it generally gross  but somehow a poblano pepper got into the fajitas and I couldn t stop coughing. I expected more from this neighborhood 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,27,I had a long day and I was craving their chips and salsa. The were really sweet and polite when I ordered and left  but when I got home less than 5 mins later  I bit into my chips and they were stale  Not just stale but when I bit into it there was no crunch. I was so sad and disappointed.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,28,Long slow slow moving line  Employees seem less than interested in moving the line along quickly.   I suggested they add a second person to apply toppings  which is where they were way backed up  and received a very rude response.  Wow thank you so much for your advice    Typical good Chipotle food  but not worth the wait.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,29,This location gets our order wrong EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. We order for delivery at least once a week  and it s so bad we ve come to expect something to be wrong.  If you re the one family member out of six in my house that actually gets their order right  you ve learned to celebrate silently.  Today was one of the worst mix ups. They left off the chicken in my son s kids meal  completely. They mixed up ingredients on my husband and daughter s meal  and they left rice and beans off of mine  so I was basically served sour cream and guacamole soup. We keep ordering because at this point we have so many free rewards from wrong orders  but we are also big chipotle fans. We d rather skip the free rewards and pay full price for the meals we actually wanted  and we wish a different location would deliver to us. There s got to be a better way to quality check and get things right. Mistakes are human and we ve tried to give Grace  but consistent error for months on end is why I m leaving this review.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,30,Worst quality food I have ever been served.  Guacamole was brown and rotten  rice and veggies were mushed  and the meat was cold.  I m embarrassed that this is the quality of food I served to my family.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,31,Joke of an operations team. I wouldn t trust them to run a lemonade stand. Twice I ve walked in at 9 15pm and have had been told were out of cheese and meat.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,32,I m not sure this even deserves two stars but I was so hungry that it still tasted good.  A bunch of high schoolers were working and were too busy talking about their ever-so-important social lives to hear my order.  And then I d get a  huh   and have to keep repeating myself.  When there was a half of scoop of rice left it was put in my bowl... the chick looked around and when more rice didn t magically appear without effort on her part... she thought she d just continue on and pretend that I didn t get screwed on rice.  Um  nope... get me more rice damn it.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,33,Been to this location several times and it is by far the worst Chipotle location I have ever been to. They are always out of ingredients and the ingredients they do have are old stale and disgusting. Had to stop the poor kid from folding my Burrito as I had just finished watching him smash the previous soggy mess. Needs major management improvements...avoid at all cost.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,34,One young lady doing a great job to work the line all by herself.  But she is only one making orders for a long line. Out of guacamole. Manager in back. Not organized at all.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,35,My son picked up a meal here recently and said the place was packed but the service was very fast and the guy on the line was flying through assembly. We will be going back again   Chipotle rocks 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,36,I love my neighborhood Chipotle HOWEVER I am frustrated that they run out of salad dressing by evening. This is my 5th time in 8 weeks to be disappointed because they are out.  PLEASE figure this out so I can leave a great review and return to  being happy about eating your yummy salads  
Chipotle Mexican Grill,37,I have not had food from here in years and will not bother again.  Very boring  rather tasteless salad.  The chicken seemed rubbery and the fajita vegetables were beyond bland.  Very little lettuce and the beans were also dull.  Honestly like taco cabana a million times better 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,38,The chips were completely stale  but that s not the worst part. The reason for only one star is I had to get my burrito made twice  because the rice was half-raw. The first time  I can t imagine how nobody else had complained because a few people got their meals before me and dined in. They tossed out the rice when I complained and had a brand new batch that they used to make my replacement burrito. The second burrito had crunchy rice as well.  This is absolutely nuts. How do you make a product in a restaurant and not make sure that it s fit to serve to customers  This is lazy and careless. I hadn t had Chipotle in too long and was excited to get a burrito today. I had to go way out of my way  and drive over a half hour to get here  because there s not a Chipotle near where I live. And the result is stale chips and crunchy rice. I don t even blame the employees because this is a training issue. The manager is absolutely to blame for this nonsense.  Also  how do you run out of corn salsa  It s one of my favourite things and I was told they were out. Then the woman behind the counter admitted they had corn  they just hadn t mixed it up yet. There were very few people eating here  I can only guess why   but nobody wanted to take the time to mix up a batch. Again  this is a management and training issue.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,39,The worst Chipotle in Austin. The regional manager of this store should be absolutely ashamed of their embarrassing store. Maybe an entire team reset revalidation  The lobby and line were in total disarray  the crew literally couldn t care less and they weren t taking anything seriously...they were just like  you should just go to the south Lamar location . I did just that and it is possibly the best location in Austin. Do yourself a favor and don t go to the westlake chipotle.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,40,This is honestly the worst chipotle in the US. Slow  slow  slow. Get mgmt to take a look as it s giving a bad reputation to the brand.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,41,Do yourself a favor and go to another chipotle. Avoid at all costs. This was the most disgusting location I have ever been to. The glass was dirty  the cook and line server were not wearing any kind of hair net or personal protective gear. I saw the guacamole was brown and asked if I could get some guac from a fresh batch and she told me that all of the guac is brown    No  its definitely not and that was the first time I ve experienced brown guac at a chipotle. She even pulled out the second batch and it looked the exact same which is super concerting as it hadn t even been sitting out. The beans were over cooked and the rice was crunchy. Absolutely disgusting. The location in sunset valley on Brodie is great-do yourself the favor and drive the extra few miles south to that one. I am honestly afraid I will get sick eating this meal. I think its time management and corporate looks into this location as all of the reviews are less than desirable Scary  
Chipotle Mexican Grill,42,This Chipotle is as good as any other Chipotle  so I m giving it 4 stars.  This one is clean  there are manageable lines  they do get longer at lunch   there are enough tables generally  and the staff is courteous.  They were recently willing to accommodate my request for a large side of white rice here  which was nice since that s all my kid will eat from here.  There are about three small outdoor tables and a stack of Austin Chronicles if you need something to read.  I am digging the Chiptopia rewards program they have going this summer  so I ll be back at least two more times in the next 11 days.  If you like Chipotle  you will like this one too.  And that s a wrap  pun intended .
Chipotle Mexican Grill,43,Great food for a quick mexican bite. It s definitely tex-mex so don t expect any home cooking here..but it is a good place and on the higher end of fast food chains and foods. You can customize any order with several different options- into a bowl  a burrito  or a large taco    Pretty much the mexican version of Subway  Quick and efficient 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,44,This was probably one of my worst experiences at a Chipotle. I was in Westlake and had lunch at the Beecave road location. The food was disgusting. The lettuce was soggy and brown. The guacamole was also brown. The staff was busy talking to each other and I felt like I was bothering them. I would not eat at that location again.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,45,I ve been here multiple times between 11-12  lunch  and they are not prepared. Missing multiple ingredients. This time they didn t have black beans... What   Management - figure it out.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,46,Clean  fast  and the sofritas are made well. Service is pretty friendly and helpful. The seating is ok but crowded when busy and one set of the doors intersects the line which can get annoying when the line gets pretty long packed. Portion sized are about average for a Chipotle.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,47,They reduce their portion size  or did I just happen to get jipped today  I got what I always get  and i m small so it lasts me two meals easily.   I noticed how small the portion was when I opened the lid  and sure enough I blew through the whole thing. I ve never been able to finish a bowl.   If they ve done it intentionally  I wish they would let the customers know about the change. I wasted my dollars.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,48,This is a bad chipotle location. It seems like there has been bad reviews for this location for a while and I ve had the same experience as all of the other reviewers  bad service  missing ingredients  SUPER skimpy- like half portion of what chipotle normally is . Maybe if we keep rating them badly someone from upper management will pay attention and come fix this place 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,49,If there were zero stars  I would give it that. I absolutely love chipotle and it s my favorite  fast food  place but I will never go back here. I waited so long in a line of 3 people because the guy behind the bar couldn t have moved any slower. Then they ran out of white rice and instead of asking the other customers if they were getting white rice or brown they decided to hold up the entire line until I spoke up that I wanted brown rice so I don t need to wait 15 minutes for the white rice. They didn t have corn or guacamole which was disappointing. The food was awful...old  not fresh  and really missing something without the guacamole and corn. The meat was awful. Fatty and overcooked. Sad I paid for the steak. Super bummed I spent  12 on a bowl and chips that ended up in the trash. Terrible service. Terrible food. A disappointment to the franchise.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,50,This was  by far  the worse experience I have ever had at any Chipotle. I walked in and was immediately assaulted by the blaring music. Unable to talk with my 2 friends without yelling  we just waited in line for food.   After I yelled the first part of my order to the first guy behind the counter  Burrito  Double rice  No beans    he proceeded to make the burrito and add rice. Then he yelled  No beans   to the guy standing right next to him who was attempting to flirt with the cashier. This guy then  very slowly  starts to scoop some undesired beans onto my burrito as I yelled  No beans   no less than 3 times as he continued to try and flirt with the cashier. He finally turned to me to ask what meat and I informed him how he had already screwed up my order and would need to remake it. I m not sure he could tell the difference between me yelling over the music vs. yelling because he was a moron who couldn t even do his simple job.   The next 2 people handled their job semi-successfully  other than making me ask for my drink cup repeatedly and finally just taking it myself. Apparently this was just too much for the cashier as she decided to go on hiatus.   5 minutes later  my 2 friends were finally able to pay for their order when someone new came to the register. Unfortunately  the new cashier had the same listening skills as beans-dude and  without verifying  charged both orders to the first card presented him. Even cruelly  was the discovery that my friends burrito contained all of 4 pieces of very fatty chicken.   After that debacle  We attempted to find a place to sit only to discover that people in this area are narcissistic a-holes who all need to sit  by themselves  at a 4 seat table  all of them texting away happily and most without food to even eat. But I guess 1 person at a 4 seat table isn t much worse than the 2 people in each of the multi-seat  wrap around party tables. Resigned to the fact that we couldn t use one of the several open 2-seat tables both inside and out  we managed to find 3 empty stools in a row at the bar  between all the individuals spaced 2 to 4 seats apart  and sat shoulder to shoulder the entire lunch. If that wasn t claustrophobic enough  the lunch rush that began 5 or 10 minutes after we sat revealed to us that the way this restaurant handled its rush was to have the line run immediately behind the backs of the people eating at the bar.  While we survived and lived to tell the tale  we will not be going back.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,51,The manager Joe needs to fired. I could not believe the way I was spoken to or treated by him. Chipotle is usually so friendly  this guy must go. I m never visiting this location again.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,52,I love chipotle but will NEVER return to this location again. THE WORST customer service I have ever experienced. I totally get not wanting to be at work on a nice day - but like cheer up and don t be rude to my family. Also  I m just here to get my food...don t have an attitude with me because I interrupted your chat time with your coworkers. And maybe clean up a little bit because the tables were filthy and the drink station was a disgusting mess.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,53,Food is good.  Service is good.  Music is too loud. Gets REALLY BUSY during lunch.   Guacamole is delicious.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,54,Love the food here. Prices reasonable for the taste and quality. Love Chipotle in general. Won t earn 5star rating until customer experience includes WIFI. Even as little as 20 or 30 minutes of WIFI let s me have a working lunch without hosing up their eating area. Until then  I sometimes have to skip Chipotle as I need to update a spreadsheet while I eat. Alas.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,55,Made my burrito way too full which made it a struggle to eat. I appreciate the extra chicken an guac that was in my burrito  but eating it wasn t what I had planned. Originally planned on ordering it to-go  but it was impossible to eat without sitting down at a table. This chipotle only had forks as utensils which made eating the overflowing burrito even harder to eat.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,56,Decent chipotle. I ve found that the portions I get here seem bigger than other chipotles and the service has been friendly in my experience. The ambiance is typical chipotle and parking shouldn t be an issue. I was a bit annoyed by the fact that they didn t have wifi though. Other than that  good experience.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,57,The food was terrible.  Our guacamole was brown and tasted like they used rotten avocados.  We got the bowl  and they barely gave us any chicken.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,58,I might as well have said   I eat babies . I m pretty sure it would have registered the same level of shock and disbelief from my friend upon hearing I had never. eaten. at. Chipotle.   So sue me. Better yet  treat me to lunch  Muahahaha  And she did     I have to admit  it was good. Like really  really good. And fresh. I am now just a little embarrassed to have been so out of the loop on this one. What can I say  Big ass burritos just aren t my thing. But  Wow  The tortilla-less burrito bowl was soooo good  I highly recommend the shredded pork  but will also be going back to try the steak....it looked damn tasty  too.   Having only been to this one location  I can t compare  but I will say it seemed a little small. We kind of inhaled our food and as we sat there visiting I m pretty sure there were folks pissed we weren t leaving. C mon....Give a girl a little time to digest    And ummmm  who knew  Apparently they have their own ordering app that you can download to your phone to send your order in  Now that s some serious Burrito-ing 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,59,As a person who loves Chipotle and consumes it 3-4 times a week  I was really disappointed that this Chipotle close to my new house was so sub-par.  I order a vegetarian salad  and they were skimpy on the black beans  fajita vegetables  pico  and guacamole.  That s 4 out of the 5 ingredients in my salad.  When I asked for more guacamole  the woman making my order rolled her eyes.  RUDE   I only received more guacamole when I told her they could charge me for it.  I decided to give the place a second try  and again received less than expected service and portions.  The S Lamar location is a lot further  but not only is the staff nicer  they are also polite if you ask for a little more black beans or guacamole.    One thing that does often bother me about Chipotle is that in general  they will give customers huge portions of meat  cheese  and sour cream  but tend to put meager portions of black beans  vegetables  and guacamole in orders.  Of course  I ll still eat Chipotle  just at another location.  This particular one does not deserve my business.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,60,I ve been told previously that Chipotle is supposedly owned by McDonalds  but a fellow Yelper set me straight. McDonald s was an investor after there were 15 locations already going. They later sold their shares of Chipotle in October 2006  and the two companies are no longer related. Little trivia for ya there   I love Chipotle  If only they had a drive-through and a location near Four Points. The main reason for this review  however  is their GUACAMOLE. It is  in my my humble but well-informed opinon  the BEST of any restaurant I ve been to. Always fresh  yummy and with the right amount of heat. No tomatoes  which is probably a bone of contention for some  but I prefer it that way. It s soft and creamy with fresh avocados  and never mushy like most places. So even though the burritos and tacos are great here  go for the guac if nothing else 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,61,How could you disappoint me like this oh maker of the Burrito Bowl   You were out of steak --just ran out one bowl before mine--and you had no reserve ready.  So I had to order chicken.  And then you went skimpy on the lettuce--not good    Then  to add insult to injury  the tomatoes were crunchier than the onions.  Why--WHY did you make me a sub-par burrito bowl 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,62,Like I have said before I have been eating at Chipotle s for a few years and have always enjoyed their food.  Lately though I have experienced quite an increase of oil in their chicken dices so I decided to test it out.  I put about 8 of them in a napkin and gave them a good squeeze....not pretty.  There is more than enough oil to go all the way through the napkin in about 2 seconds.    I have spoken with the management about it but they just tell me it is from the grill.  Starting to give me second thoughts...
Chipotle Mexican Grill,63,When it comes burritos  I consider Chipotle to be on a rung below Freebirds.  But unfortunately  I live a lot closer to a Chipotle and my wife likes it  so sometimes that ends up being the meal choice - as it was today.  The steak burrito with rice  pinto beans  corn  pico  lettuce  and cheese wasn t terrible  but it also wasn t anything special.  A couple of bites were notable for how salty they were - almost like some undissolved salt wasn t mixed-in enough.  Oh well  i wasn t expecting a whole lot anyway.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,64,Chipotle. Clean. Quick and Easy.  Folks working here are nice. And for all the south park fans  as am I    it doesn t make you crap blood.  I would like them to include sliced avocados as an option for my burrito bowl though.  mmmm Avocados  
Chipotle Mexican Grill,65,This was a good experience. I arrived at 12 30 and there was plenty of seating and the staff were efficient. I waited in line for an amount of time that is not even memorable. All the food was fresh  the line moved quickly  and paying was not an issue. The drink station was clean and full. I could not ask for more.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,66,We rarely get enough time during lunch to get away... but when we do  we want to take some time out of our stressful schedule.  Not happening at this Chipotle location.  The employees here have a huge attitude problem.  Smile people   It doesn t hurt   Be friendly with your customers so that they will come back.  Ever heard of  check your problems at the door      If you don t like your job then maybe you should find another one.  Something that suits you better and that you would love doing.  Food is great except the chips...  a little on the stale side.  And sometimes  depending on the server  they tend to get a little stingy with the serving.  I ve experienced better.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,67,I love this particular location.  On a weekday if I come before 11 30  I can be in and out in roughly 4 to 5 minutes and they never skimp on the sour cream. The lady that works at the beginning of the serving line can PUT those orders away like a boss. That s a good quality in a busy place around lunchtime when a bunch of Westlake professionals can be briskly demanding their weekly Chipotle.   Last year I ate nothing but exclusively Freebirds  but then I discovered the greatness of their crunchy tacos which brought me back to this Chipotle addiction and only solidifies my biweekly to weekly fill  which in progress leads me to demand why they don t have a loyalty card because I need to rack up these points  mayn 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,68,If you re in a hurry and looking for a good spot to stop in for lunch  Chipotle is the spot.  It s not your everyday fast food  it tastes good and you re in and out fairly quick.    Not something to go out of your way for though.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,69,This location plays the music at the loudest setting possible. The noise level is outrageous - we have stopped going here due to the lack of concern for customer service. Avoid this restaurant location.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,70,OK  I LOVE Chipotle because it s one of the only quick serve places where I can enjoy a non-fried  no bread  low carb meal quickly. I always order a Chicken bowl with small amount of brown rice  heaping helping of the grilled veggies  toped off with pico  corn and lettuce. And the ingredients are fresh and taste great.  But at this particular location  the last two times in a row I ve gone in  they were out of veggies and had none cooking. Then they ask me  rhetorically I guess   do you want to wait .   Uh  do I have a choice if I want my veggies  Of course I ll wait  even though you should be doing a better job of managing the food line and not running out of grilled veggies.  This sucks because now I m just some weirdo standing there aimlessly while others come through the line  skipping veggies  and I m just tapping my toe watching the cook finally drop a bunch of veggies into the wok back there  which takes about 7 minutes to cook up properly.  At least this last time I was offered a free drink while a wait  which gave me something to do for 30 seconds before I continued waiting.   Other than this grievance  I like this location. It s clean  service is good and fast and the food is great.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,71,I ve eaten here twice. Both times the people working here were really nice and the service was fast. The problem is that some of the ingredients were lukewarm both times and the rice had super hard kernels in it. Also  they barely drain the black beans before throwing them on your burrito and then it just drips everywhere.  HEY BURRITO MAKERS ALL AROUND THE WORLD  DRAIN THE BLACK BEANS  DRAIN EM GOOD   Yesterday  I got a burrito with a bunch of super hard rice kernels  please replace the rice when it s been sitting there  y all   and super wet bean juices  on top of that the sofritas was borderline cold. I was hungry and already at home so I finished it but it left me not wanting Chipotle for a long time.  This place would be good if they put your burrito together like someone who is about to eat a burrito  not someone who wants to get it over with as fast as possible. Speed isn t everything.   Also they need to switch out ingredients more so they stay fresh.  I m not against Chipotle. Not even against this location  but the people who work here need to take the freshness of their ingredients more seriously.  Thankfully Cabo Bob s exists.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,72,I have been to a lot of Chipotle Mexican Grills across America. And this one in the Westlake area  is the best ever. So I highly recommend that you check them out.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,73,Awful service   I had to ask the cashier to print me a receipt  the knives and spoons are apparently kept under lock and key so I had to back to the counter for a knife and most annoyingly the soda fountain had no carbonation so I had to go back to he counter again to inform them of that.  After waiting for 10 minutes and no one bothering to come to do anything about the sofa fountain I went back to the counter to ask why nothing had been done.  He had no answer so he walked to the back and another person walked up.  He apparently was the manger and told me that the cashier was supposed to tell me when I ordered my drink that the sofa fountain had no carbonation.  I explained to him that he didn t  nor did he bother to mention it when I came and told him that there was no carbonation or when I came back to ask why nothing had been done about it.  By this time I was extremely upset with the poor service and the very apparent lack of concern by any of the employees in so I walked out with my meal not even half finished.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,74,I love this place.  The food is tasty  fresh and so very filling.  I try to eat just half a burrito - also definitely a wise idea.  But I usually end up eating the whole thing.  They have a burrito bowl - without the tortilla. I like the veggie - but understand the pork is really good.  I love that they have natural pork and chicken.  Fewer hormones and antibiotics are always a good thing. The service is quick and friendly.  I usually get it to go - but I like eating there too   in the round booths.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,75,I eat here 3-4 times a week mostly because I like the burrito bowl option. The only reason I don t give it 4 stars is at lunch this place is packed  and the seating is limited. it would be nice if they moved to a larger location with a bit more room.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,76,Don t get me wrong  I love me some Chipotle  but this location has it all wrong. Very unprofessional of the woman to snap at me because she couldn t understand my order in line... It consisted of tacos and a bowl. The bowl was barely half full and the guac didn t even help that situation. The people at the check out area did not ask if I would like a drink. I guess the people ordering on the phone were priority... The man standing next to the girl at the register told me to  hold on real fast ... Luckily I had cash. Later goons.... Not coming back to this one.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,77,Always good. I ALWAYS have the same thing  which  for me  is awesome  flour tortilla  extra white rice  barbacoa  sour cream  cheese. I think I could live off the barbacoa alone 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,78,I ordered online to avoid the lunch rush.  This location tends to get pretty crowded.  Service was friendly and fast  but I wont make the mistake of ordering online again.  I ended up receiving a steak burrito made almost exclusively of rice.  even the  cheaper  ingredients like salsa were non existent. I recommend ordering at the store so the servers are held accountable.  Unless you really like rice  in which case you ll love this place.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,79,Lifelong fan of Chipotle  from Denver .  This location was very stingy on guacamole and chicken.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,80,Are you really reading reviews of Chipotle    I know  I know...you re all thinking   Why the hell did he write a review of Chipotle if he was going to hate on me for reading his review   Well  I m only writing this review because today I won 10 free lunches  which they arbitrarily upgraded to 20.  Aside from that this place is fast as hell and packed during lunch hours. But it s still just fast food burritos.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,81,Nothing but wanna be fresh ingredients  terrible parking  The only reason this place is still open because the snobby rich Westlake kids come here and share giggles 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,82,So sad to see a once friendly  good neighborhood restaurant go so far downhill.  In a town busting with great taco places you would think that they would at least try to be courteous.  Has management changed   1.  When my vegetarian daughter asked for a little more rice on her 3 item soft taco  white rice  black beans  and guacamole  they said no.  Considering the price of rice and how much they charge for their three tiny tacos this is ridiculous.  Just how much profit do they want to make off of her  2.  She was ordering for the whole family from a list that she brought.  When she didn t move down the line fast enough  for their liking   they rudely told her she would have to hurry up.   3.  When she got home she discovered her tiny taco tortillas torn up so much she had to eat it with a fork. 4.  Her  1.90 soda didn t have any syrup in it.  I tasted it and it was  flat soda water.  She had to throw it out.    Bad parking  marginal tacos  rude service  diminishing portions   lost loyal customer  Maria s Taco Express  Taco Deli  Torchy s Tacos all friendlier places with better food  better portions and worth the drive.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,83,I will never eat at this chipotle again     I ordered 2 burrito bowls and presented with a coupon for one free the cashier ripped the coupon before applying it apologized for doing so and said may be next time     They are very stingy with all ingredients always salty and poor service. A friend of mine found a ladybug in her lettuce  went back to the store and was told  we don t wash our lettuce         I say Eat at your own risk
Chipotle Mexican Grill,84,clean  simple  and delicious burritos  tacos  salads. good value  generous portions. national chain but usually very consistent with high quality.  This one usually hits the mark.  Good value for the  .
Taqueria La Morena,1,Pretty dang good. Prices are on point too. Highly recommend. After eating heeded you will feel heavy tho.
Taqueria La Morena,2,Come here for the fajita and suadero 100  order both salsas and some line to go with it 
Taqueria La Morena,3,Best chicken fajita tacos in town   They are located on 760 Airport now
Taqueria La Morena,4,Beef tacos lacked flavor. What flavor was possibly in there was drowned out by the spicy hot sauce. Would not return here.
Taqueria La Morena,5,Love this place. Always consistent and pretty quick. Fresh corn and flour tortillas  The green sauce is legit  Also  knowing a little Spanish will ordering a lot easier. Enjoy peeps.
El Secreto De Abuela,1,Incredible tacos. The barbacoa and pastor are not to be looked over  Thank you for the great service too
El Secreto De Abuela,2,Was running Saturday morning errands and had some time to kill to grab some breakfast somewhere new. The staff very nice and kind. We shared the Abuela s Plate.  It comes with fajita beef  chicken and pork with rice  beans  lettuce  tomato  guac and sour cream for  16.49. It comes with 2 tortillas so we ordered two more. I would say you could probably make 5 to 6 tacos out of the whole platter if you are wanting to share. Portion size wasn t bad  but the meat wasn t amazing. It wasn t horrible  but I like a bit more flavor. They do not serve chips and salsa complimentary. If you like super spicy they don t have it  but were nice and brought us a store bought bottle of habanero salsa so that did the trick  Overall cozy spot with sweet staff  but the food just didn t hit the spot for me.
El Secreto De Abuela,3,This was sooo legit and good  and it could be a 5  but because there was some kind of meat in my potatoes on the huevos plate  after I said no meat  I took it down a star  but only one because the waitress offered to bring new ones. That aside  I am sooooooo happy by boyfriend decided to come here instead of another taco truck on his first visit to Austin. This is definitely an unsuspecting gem of a find  traditional Mexican  good cheaper food  made with love by Abuela.
El Secreto De Abuela,4,After having many good experiences at this restaurant and writing a stellarreview  coming here since they just opened and buying their food throughout the pandemic. This little waitress has an attitude. So for whatever reason they only put a tablespoon of onions on the side of the plate for the chilaquiles. Everybody knows that the onions go on top. Anyway so I asked for more onions and she just gets irritated with me about the whole thing and then charges me a dollar for it and then goes into some big justification about how people don t like onions. I do not care. Anyway I didn t tip her. She s got some kind of attitude. Anyway I work service industry I give absolute best customer service in my field and here I am on my day off at 8 30 in the morning and she s charging me a dollar for onions because they only gave me a tablespoon. Who puts a tablespoon of onions on chilaquiles  Anyway I think I m going to start going someplace else for my Mexican food. Especially seeing that I have brought so many people over here all of my family eats here I ve introduced all of my friends. This place doesn t know how to value their customers. In addition the food wasn t hot. What s the deal with that  The beans were like tepid. And the chilaquiles weren t even hot. It was so weird. I mean a dollar so I ll have a total of two tablespoons of onions on my chilaquiles. People don t know anything about customer service. So here she s being a little witch because she s got an attitude and now I m giving this terrible review. So there you have it
El Secreto De Abuela,5,Excellent down-home Mexican food with two very good salsas. Small place  not fancy but table service by nice people. Much Spanish spoken.
National Taco Championships,1,Taco Man is my new love. Taco Man 512 only does catering and hopefully will open a store front soon. He specializes in pork tacos and if you ask for it Toms style  the tack shell is crispy cheese only and oh so tasty. Also I loved El Dorado Cafe s beef taco which was on the yellowest of corn tortillas and flavored very delicious. I m pumped to learn El Dorado is near one of my yoga studios. Also I liked Hurache s beef taco which was simply delicious. I definitely will visit their restaurant.   Now that taco chat is over I ll spill the beans about the festival. Super smiley taco hosts welcomed us into the gate. We arrived early and there were not many people when we walked in which was great. We were able to walk around and talk to each booth to get our taco mouths really watering. We decided our top 6 ones to try then lost track of taco time. My friend wouldn t share hers so I had to double back and get more. Hahaha and by friend I mean me. We hung out in the VIP area and tasted a few margaritas which were a little too tasty. Then heard the band Fertility House. I tried to throw my eggs at them. They were terrific very good feeling band and handsome chaps. But still they didn t want to fertilize my eggs. We saw some Mexican wrestlers in panties and dressed up chicauawa  sp   dog models strutting the runway.   Austin was the first stop of this festival tour  Finale is in Sin City. Bring on the Vegas Taco War. Double Down. Split the Aces Always.
National Taco Championships,2,Fun time  Many many choices. Lucha  food  drinks and you CAN pay when you get here  More to follow  Wow   More  At last got seated in a spot  wiped the tacos from my beard and then a bit of rain started. The event is very easy to get dropped off by someone or a rideshare. There is plenty of security and I did not see any problems  except for trying to decide what to eat next. Once you tightened your wristband  and they did have people there to guide you through the process of having your wristband activated. One thing that was not really clear to me was if you could purchase the wristbands there. Now I know  you can. I don t really like purchasing early and save a few bucks and then something happens and I can t go. The wristbands I purchased ahead were  12.00 and they were  20.00 if you purchased upon arrival  Another YELPER and I had arrived early  and actually found a place to park    The vast amount of taco representatives were amazing  even from as far away as  Brownsville. You had the fancy setups and the simple. I made a beeline right for those who you could see were cooking border style and then also tried several who come from other parts of the city. You went down one line of vendors  then up another set  with Lucha set up   then another  then a nice soundstage. It was simply impossible to eat even a small selection as there were so many from which to choose. So I stuffed myself with all I could eat and be able to still move.  One of my gut instincts was to watch for tortillas being made and especially those in the smaller size of Mexico City street tacos. Tacos ran  3.00 so I stuck to what I could not easily get routinely. I was not going for  size but quality that fit my taste. This was a home run for me. I would have stayed even longer  but I was so full I couldn t even order a shot of tequila or a margarita as I would explode  Hopefully it will be here next year again.
National Taco Championships,3,VIP tickets were great  but no tacos  with meat  in the VIP lounge  ran out by 3 45 . Otherwise a great time and fun. Watched the taco eating contest - 6 tacos in 6 minutes  Torchy s Trailer Parks  . No one could do it. My son says he easily could have done it   
National Taco Championships,4,Tacos  tacos  tacos  Fun  albeit disorganized time. The staff were less than friendly and gave us no rundown on where the VIP area was located or how anything worked. Turns out you can get tacos at any stand  but can only get beverages in the lounge. Unnecessarily confusing. That being said  the taco purveyors were super-friendly and there was something for everyone - vegan  meaty  and everything in between. With a little more attention to logistics  this could become a great annual Austin tradition.
National Taco Championships,5,Spent some time looking up tacos for this event in preparation and headed into Austin. Parking found by Butler Park and less than a mile walk. Yelp elite tickets waiting for us at will call  and we were excited to try this out. However the 2 guest services members could not locate our tickets. They appeared  extremely unmotivated to try. We left as we came hungry. 2 hours later we were told they were there all along. Food smelled good and bands seemed okay. Would have loved to spend the day sampling tacos and listening to music. My advice is if you can avoid will call do it.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,1,Honestly have been here a dozen times and have never had a bad experience. I realized I only write reviews for bad experiences but never good ones. So I thought I d change.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,2,This location is a flaming trash fire. Whoever this GM is  if they even have one  has no clue how to run any establishment  unless it s simply into the ground.   I just came in 9 14 to a sign on the door saying lobby closed take out only  okay no worries I don t sit and eat-- it s a fast eat establishment.   I left 17 minutes later after having seen one of three people in front of me get their burrito.   Okay so you re slow  okay.  Your lobby is closed during operating hours  okay.   Here s where we ve crossed the line  your team has endless stacks of dishes piled on food prep bar  food sitting out of temp control while you reach in and out of your line looking for ingredients.   Then the real kicker and the one OSHA would have a field day about is the hazardous cleaning products on the service line- yikes yikes and yikes.   Also  I d like to mention while waiting in line I placed a pick up order at the slaughter location.   Get it together  sincerely a former Chipotle employee who s manager would have NEVER allowed such a simple concept to burn down.   This location is a reoccurring disaster and this will be the last time we come 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,3,Sad  comically wrapped square cold burrito with the tiniest portions I ve ever seen at a Chipotle. This store needs a management overhaul.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,4,If you re going to make me wait for my pre-paid online order  at least say  thank you for your patience  or  sorry for that wait  Really wish this wasn t my local Chipotle
Chipotle Mexican Grill,5,This is the dirtiest chipotle I ve ever seen  No attempts to clean the serving counter. Yea they were busy but a quick wipe down doesn t hurt between orders. The food was getting mixed a bit  sour cream was a mystery what was dropped in there. All tables were dirty.. would suggest a different chipotle.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,6,Went to chipotle last night around 6 pm to grab a couple bowls to go. Got my wife a veggie bowl with  double rice   picture speaks for itself. My chicken bowl was no better. C mon  chipotle do better.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,7,Negative 5 starsrude staff  dirty dining room  order wrong  COCKROACH  After making an order online I went inside and waiting about 7 mins for my order to be ready which was a veggie quesadilla. Once I receive my order I checked it in the car and noticed I received the sides and chips but no veggie quesadilla. I went back inside to let them know it was missing and said they would make it right then. I patiently waited over 20 mins and finally after serving everyone else--even people who arrived after myself  did the staff member begin to make my quesadilla. I watched as his set his cup straight on top of the stack of tortillas. Outside of the package mind you. When I confronted him to start with a fresh tortilla he gave me so much attitude. When I was finally about to get my order which was stillllll wrong   received a cheese quesadilla   I noticed there was a COCKROACH crawling on the counter
Chipotle Mexican Grill,8,If you want a good warm burrito  you re at the wrong place.  Right now it s 50 degrees outside and there s nothing I love more than a half hearted Icee burrito made by shitpotle .
Chipotle Mexican Grill,9,This location blows. When the workers actually get the order right it often tastes bad. Placing an online order means waiting inside after your pickup time and asserting yourself since no one will offer to help. If you do order here  I d recommend checking your order before you drive off. You may have received the wrong one.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,10,Red headed girl turned her back on me after asking if I had a mask. I just said I didn t have one. I ve just been in around rock and nobody was requiring them. Instead of just being incredible disrespectful and not even having a conversation  try talking to people. I will never go here again and am considering banning chipotle all together. If these are the people you chose to hire  it says a lot about your company.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,11,Filthy. Reported to Austin Health Department. It s that bad.  Completely indifferent and immobile staff unwilling to attempt to care.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,12,This location is just bad.  Every single time I get the chips they re chewy  cold and stale.  They constantly give you very small portions.  And don t even think about ordering the brisket...they roll their eyes and shake their heads no.  Not a big deal  just take down the 7 signs you have promoting it.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,13,It s chipotle. You get exactly what you d expect  and I m happy with that. The employees do their job  you get to eat  it s all good
Chipotle Mexican Grill,14,I can t believe I m writing a review on Yelp for a chipotle but I cannot with this location always giving me a half scoop of everything. I usually could never finish my chipotle bowl in under five minutes but never fail to with this location. Half of my bowl was literally empty. With how many food options are in this area  just skip it. I regret going every single time because of this location. Do better
Chipotle Mexican Grill,15,Don t go to this location   They always take forever and order always manages to have something wrong with it. Also  don t even bother ordering ahead of time for a specific pick up time  because odds are you ll still have to wait 30  minutes. This location needs to get it together.   The stassney location isn t very far and is very prompt with online orders.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,16,Chipotle needs to get it together. Food was wrong  mangled  missing items  and served with a side of attitude.  Freebirds has many more options  more flavor  and friendly people. I usually opt for free birds and thought I want some chipotle this time. What a headache just trying to get the food I ordered. They really got one piece of lettuce in my whole burrito bowl and then said it wasn t their problem  basically. No thanks sis.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,17,Horrible portions. I always order double everything down the line and the person preparing my food usually has to double wrap my burrito since it s so much food. Today I ordered double everything and it was the smallest pathetic burrito I have ever received. It was the size of a a pack of ice breaker mints. I don t mind paying  15 for a burrito but when I pay for double everything and the portions are equivalent if not less than a normal burrito I have an issue. Does this look like double everything to you  Giving two stars because the cashier was very kind.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,18,Fast  amp  Furious. Fajita bowls were quickly made. Food was consistently as good as other Chipotles. But the past couple of times we ve visited this location  at one or more of the employees have been in a crappy mood and it SHOWS   Thumbs Down.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,19,This is my very first bad review. Went in for lunch today and they were pretty busy and thats expected  however I wait behind a good amount of people to get up to order which took about 10-15 minutes. I begin to place mine and my coworkers order to bring back to the office and they have no steak. I asked the woman helping me if she knew how long it would take and she kindly told me she would find out. She asks the cook and the cook himself had no eta on the steak. It just really aggravated me to have waited and walked out with no food. I had to go back to the office and miss out on lunch. I just dont understand how the cooks were not prepared for a lunch shift in one of the most busiest locations.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,20,Everything is good in restaurant just don t you dare ever try to order anything off DoorDash Uber eats etc. they seriously short you on portion size and say you have to add extra rice which is free but there s no options. Extremely unsatisfied and I love chipotle.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,21,After giving up on the Slaughter Monaco location due to their inability to get an order correct  I ve come to this location twice. The first time was fine four stars. The second time half of our order was missing - zero stars. Hence the average of two stars. After arriving home with the botched order  I called the restaurant. After probably 20 rings  I talked to someone who could only say  ok  but eventually put me on a long hold and  finally  a manager came on the line. The manager offered to refund the order  which I assume will happen . I think this was the right thing to do since two of us were planning on having Chipotle for lunch and that didn t happen. When two bowls are ordered and charged for  it should not be difficult to count two bowls in the bag. My lesson - always double-check.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,22,Welp this is still the worst chipotle in all of Texas. Half the staff wasn t wearing masks  food flung all over every surface. Only person that was not rude was the girl at the register.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,23,Came today to try the cauliflower rice. Waited in line 20 min before leaving. They prioritized 10 online orders before helping the people in the stores. Ridiculous and rude. Would not recommend this location.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,24,I come here for the tea  Quesorito is amazing   Don t order it  It holds up the line a lot  Ok... order it. You ll like it
Chipotle Mexican Grill,25,They give you little to nothing. Not even a full scoop of rice. Girl who works at the front of the line to take your order gave me the most pathetic scoop of rice ever. My bowl is the equivalent of a toddler s meal. Do better.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,26,This evening  10 15   1730  the staff very friendly and efficient. I really appreciated the small talk with Dennis. He even thanked me for being a nurse. I appreciate that. This place is y all s pretty packed  but not tonight. All staff this evening was great and I got my order to go in no time.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,27,Chipotle is my favorite  fast food  restaurant. I order here basically once a week  This is the closest location to my work. I ve had good experiences with the staff and my orders when I go in to order however EVERY time I order delivery items are missing or incorrect.   I try not to exaggerate in reviews but it s gotten to the point where I have to closely watch my order on the app and intercept the door dash driver between when they accept the order and when they leave the restaurant and I have to text them to confirm with the restaurant that they included my side items  chips and guac  etc. it has now happened 4 times in a row  April 15  April 30  May 11 and today June 29 . When I do not contact the door dash driver the order is always incorrect. Unfortunately at work I don t always have time to stalk my order. I got busy today and missed the notification my order had been picked up and knew I would be disappointed. An item was missing. It s super frustrating to pay for items and not receive them unless you strictly micromanage. It s upsetting because when you re ordering delivery there s just nothing you can do unless you spend the money to reorder and meet the  10 delivery minimum just to get items you already paid for. On the bright side all 4 times I ve done this Chipotle customer service has refunded me. They wouldn t have to do this if the store paid more attention to ALL items on the orders.  I m excited for the Slaughter Ln location to open and give them a try. Hopefully they put more care into their mobile orders.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,28,Came in with a bogo coupon and my order wasn t ready. No biggie and I didn t mind the wait. However  only 1 out of the 7 employees were wearing masks. The lady doing the toppings was sweating like a pig. In these times of a pandemic it s just crazy how these employees at this particular chipotle are breathing directly over fresh food going into your plate or burrito 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,29,20 years of eating Chipotle and this is by far the worst burrito I ve ever had at one. Stale rice  small portions  super strong onion flavor to the salsa. Yuck. Go to ANY OTHER CHIPOTLE until they revamp whatever mess is causing this poor excuse for a burrito. The Chipotle on Riverside rules 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,30,This chipotle has terrible service. 10 people in line and all they care about is online ordering. Their system is horribly inefficient compared to other local chipotle s. I d avoid at all cost.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,31,Chipotle is my favorite place to eat  however I downloaded their app and ordered online  picked up my order and went home. It was super easy and I got to pass the line. However it is SO disappointing to find out that they FORGOT to put guacamole in my veggie bowl after making it all the way home    wow how ridiculous.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,32,Normally love the burrito bowls with guacamole.  However today they had a the grossest brown guacamole.  When I asked if they had fresher guacamole they said no this and this what they are selling.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,33,This review hurts to write because Chipotle is one of my favorite chains to eat at. This location however leaves a lot to be desired. The employees all seemed out of it and made multiple mistakes as we were ordering including telling us there was no more white rice and then when we went to the next step in line  the rice was brought out. They also dropped food in other food so it mixed when we asked for certain  items  forgot we ordered an extra tortilla twice  and when we asked for a bigger scoop of guac we were told quIte rudely the exact qt. size we could have. We didn t know scooping out quacamole was such a science as every time we ve been to Chipotle we ve seemed to get a different amount. In addition to the terrible service experience  the music plying was terrible and the restaurant was not clean.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,34,Worse Chipotle ever. Dirty floors and tables. Rude staff unwilling to answer questions because they seem hurried. The cooking are looked ok but the serving are not as good. One wonders how they didn t have yet another outbreak. Terribly disappointed be I liked stopping there every now and then. Not anymore. Much rather go to any good locally owned mom and pop texmex restaurant in the neighborhood  and there are many 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,35,I ve gone to this Chipotle so may times and haven t been disappointed. But the last few times I ve ordered online with this location they have messed up my order  and I ve been asking for extra scoops of some things but it seems like they ve been giving half scoops of almost everything to the point where every order has been getting smaller and smaller. I will try to come in next time to see if they just don t pay attention to online orders.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,36,White rice wasn t full cook and it was disappointed because I can t finish whole burrito to continue eat half hard rice that I wouldn t able enjoy to eat rest of stuff in burrito
Chipotle Mexican Grill,37,I went into this Chipotle location to get a veggie bowl.  Walked inside and the dining room was a mess.  Chipotle food scraps were all over the tables and the floor.  Trash cans were overflowing with lots of trash on the floor. It looked like the dining room hadn t been cleaned in a couple of days.  Basically  disgusting.  I stood in line for a few minutes and then I decided to leave.  Get with it  Chipotle   Clean your dining room   
Chipotle Mexican Grill,38,I love chipotle. Hell  I use to work for them.. But this location is terrible with portions.  Moving here I thought with it being the Tex-Mex  cause it s texas  feel it d be the same as in Orlando  but it wasn t. I m not sure about other locations in Austin  but this one has made me stay away from chipotle in general. Which is a shame because I use to give chipotle my business everyday in Florida.   Every time I go in it s a terrible attitude from high school employees. I ve wrote in SEVERAL TIMES  and was given the typical coupons. That s not the point.. I want chipotle back..  I waited to give them time to improve  which was an entire year  came in  and the SAME TERRIBLE service. Eyerolls  no cares  and ridiculously small portions.   I worked for chipotle  I know the portion sizes... I m not sure what s going on with the store  but whoever is running it is skimping on sizes for costs  and is hiring the bare minimum.   Sorry chipotle  but you aren t gonna last in Austin with this type of business model. There s a TON of other taco burrito options here  and you need to step your game up.  I won t be returning to another chipotle  and that hurts my soul  but this Sunset Valley location ruined it for good for me.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,39,Unfortunately this is the closest location for me and that s certainly unfortunate.  The staff is a revolving door  and the portions are TINY  never an issue at other locations  I always ask for more rice and meat  COME ON   On several occasions the rice has been undercooked and too many pieces of chicken have been overally chewy   not edible.  I ve filled out several surveys with constructive feedback and now I m Yelping.  I m starting to think nobody reads the surveys     
Chipotle Mexican Grill,40, Do you want some hair with your food   One of the front male employees that is preparing the food during lunch time has so much curly hair under his hat that you can barely see his eyes or face. It is disgusting to see a big tuft of hair just hanging over the food he is preparing for customers. That is a health violation. Who knows how much hair this kids had shedded in peoples food. I called and spoke to a female that said she was a manager. She didn t present herself as a manager and had an attitude. I explained to her how that is a violation of the health code. She said all that they require is a hat and that he has a lot of hair to under the hat. I said then he should wear a hair net or go preform a job that doesn t require him to handle food with all that hair. She didn t care. It s pitiful that even with the COVID and all the health requirements put in place by the CDC that she could care less. I called on 7 30 20 to complain. Please research who the PM manager is and please retrain her.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,41,Least favorite Chipotle location  and I ve been multiple times . Employees were complaining and absolutely rude. They were out of just about everything and literally filled my bowl with food scrapped from the bottom of the container. Definitely take the time to drive to another one  will not be back.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,42,I literally loathe going to this location. In my old town out of state I d do chipotle 3-4 times a week  but since moving to Austin it has dwindled down to once every 6 months to a year and today after almost a year I tried again and it s the same thing.. Just terrible service. Everybody looks miserable  doesn t look you in the eye  mumbles  keeps their head down and is in robot mode...  By far the worst Chipotle I ve been too out of at least 11-12 I ve been too  and unfortunately this is the closes one to me.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,43,ROACH IN THE FOOD  AND IT WAS ALIVE. This is absolutely disgusting and unacceptable. I was in the middle of my meal when I discovered it. So grossed out.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,44,Painfully slow  constantly running out of items and increasing the wait time.   Happens frequently  not a one time occurrence.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,45,Amazing service   When I arrived there was a bit of a line  but the employees were all kind and informative letting the next person in line know they would be right with them. Just the acknowledgement when people have been waiting and are hungry alleviates the hanger and impatience. After ordering  I noticed I would have liked a bit more cheese on top of the tacos. The staff were kind enough to add a bit more and even offer an additional clean lid  while socially distancing. Best Chipotle service I ve had in a while 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,46,Guac wasn t made with any seasoning...plain and flavorless  Handful of chips with guac. very pinchpenny  Rushed from the tortilla guy on through the whole line. Ignored my asking for a side of beans  saying  here you go  and sliding the tortillas down the line. As in  I m not going to tell you I m not the condiment side guy  you   amp  4 .   They forgot my daughter s chicken for her make-your-own tacos.   Needs a serious attitude adjustment all around.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,47,Ordered 3 rice bowls carried out.  When we got home the rice was raw.  This isn t the first time the rice or beans have been undercooked but this time the rice was not edible.  Tried to call twice and no one answered the phone.  Very displeased.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,48,This chipotle was very rude with one of my recent visits. I had gone to chipotle on my lunch from work  unfortunately I forgot my wallet at home. I had some gold dollars and change in the car luckily because I didn t have time to go Home. I sat in the line going out the door because there doing mobile orders while you sit there. The lady had Schaffed at me off when I had handed her the gold dollars to pay for my meal. She then said I had to have exact change. I explained that I didn t have my wallet and she could keep the extra 24 cents. Instead she told me no and I had to leave super embarrassing and rude. Especially since there were no signs saying they had to have exact change or you can t pay in cash.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,49,One of those chipotle locations that gives you half a scoop of everything and like 5 chips so you re paying  12 for a snack. Just go to the one on BeeCave road
Chipotle Mexican Grill,50,I like this Chipotle  I ve been here several times over the past few month  amp  NEVER had a bad experience. Sometimes they are busy with a long line  but they get through it quickly like any other Chipotle. Maybe the other reviewers were here on days when they were overwhelmingly busy due to popularity  Anyway  I personally recommend this Chipotle location and I enjoyed lunch here today.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,51,Hey Chipotle franchise owner for this location on Brodie  do you simply not care about what s going on     This is the 2nd time this happens  so I had to speak up.  Today at 7ish pm we went in to order a few things to go.  There was no chicken we were informed.  The steak they did have was burnt and dry.  I asked to wait for more to be cooked  as I was informed it was almost done   it looked raw.  I asked if more was coming soon  maybe I just received the undercooked batch   I was very rudely told that was all they had.    With all of the buzz in the news and the lack of lines you re experiencing these days  you d think you d place customer service and quality at the top of your list.  Unfortunately  neither were there today or the previous visit.  There are too many amazing places to eat to bother with this location again  and from the reviews other s have left  I think sadly for this location on Brodie  it s not us  it s you that s causing this break up.    
Chipotle Mexican Grill,52,What the hell was up with this    Mr. Grill Master in the back was showing off his grilling skills to apparently VIP access members with no hair nets and long hair flopping all over my food. Idk if the Health Inspector would have enjoyed that  but I certainly did not. As a Chiptopia Survivor  I am seriously disappointed with the quality of this establishment.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,53,For the love of everything that is holy in this world STOP and I mean STOP putting sweet tea in every tea container even when it s labeled  unsweetened     This is just so stupid I have to write this but the last 4 times I have been in whoever is making the tea only knows how to make sweet tea and it s disgusting    My food was fine enough. The chips are always stale and have so much salt on them they are almost inedible. So imagine trying to wash that salt out of your mouth with a big gulp of the unsweetened ice tea you believed you got. Only to find out it was SWEET TEA  It was an assault on my mouth.   Am I being dramatic....yes  of course.  However  come on Chipotle...it s not rocket science.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,54,The queso is not good. It s gritty. The amount you get in a serving  for 2 people  is a joke. I think real ingredients are great  but please add some sodium citrate or something to make it smooth.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,55,I know it s hard to find good employees that work hard and are friendly and act like they want to help customers. But it s not impossible. It starts with leadership - managers that model the behaviours. If the managers are hustling to clean dirty tables and greet customers with a smile and hello  then that can become the standard. And then you can ask young kids to do it and they will have a standard to emulate. The food is the same at every Chipotle. It s a factory. Pretty hard to mess that up. But I don t see managers that care and then the employees don t care enough to to greet customers or maybe they don t care enough to wash their hands. This can be and needs to be improved.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,56,The three girls working at the counter were not polite to me and my friend. They forgot about my quesadilla  didn t let me add more ingredients to it  and didn t even cut it in half before they sent me out the door. They were not responsive and made the experience very uncomfortable. They continued to check people out as I stood in the corner  finally asking if they forgot about my food. They put it in the bag with the food falling out onto everything else  1 10 experience.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,57,Usually chipotle is a good compromise between fast food and good food.  Never great  but reliable  eatable and relatively fast. Sure  the  barbacoa  is really just roast  but it works for what it is.  Not today. Everything was a hassle. No tea  disjointed service  dry steak  no baskets for our burritos.  The usual well-oiled machine was dry and out of time today.  My guess is that they have a lot of new staff and waiting for a few weeks is a good idea.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,58,I eat at chipotle all the time and usually it s great. However  this location was awful. The guacamole I received was brown and not fresh  lettuce was left off my bowl  and the white and brown rice were doused with so much lime juice it was basically inedible. The server was so stingy with ingredients my bowl was maybe half full. Not sure what s going on with this location but I was very disappointed.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,59,I picked up an online order yesterday afternoon and every one of my items was wrong. On top of that the quantity was about 1 2 to 1 3 of what they normally give. They put probably 2 full spoons of sour cream on my bowl which 3 ingredients were left off of  which made the bowl a creamy gross mess.  I usually don t have an experience this bad here but I m probably not going back. I understand getting one order wrong. That s a mistake. But seriously I ordered 3 bowls and they were all wrong and missing about 1 2 the food.  This wasn t a case of getting someone else s order either as our names were on the lids.  The food was not fresh tasting either. We ate what they gave us even though it was not what we ordered. It was not good and I had immediately wished I would not have eaten it. I was so irritated that I was not willing to drive 30 min to get the order corrected.  I called to complain and ask for a refund and was told to send a comment to their website. I have not had any response to my complaint as of now.  Very bad.  UPDATE   I heard back from their support and have been offered a free meal card which I am happy to accept. Updated to 2 stars for now.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,60,Great Service and food  Very consistent.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,61,I hate when I have a craving for chipotle   I normally don t feel the urge because the line is Usually too long and I know I ll talk myself out of it before I reach the end of the line   but last weekend I waited it out.... well  it was ok. It wasn t terrible and I realize my bowl is very basic compared to all the possibilities but still..... I do not like fatty chunks of unchewable meat in my bowl    I went with the steak bowl and very little rice   lettuce red salsa tiny bit of corn too.  Everything had tons of flavor but the meat was a bit rare even for me and then the fact there were literal chunks of fat mixed in with the meat.  I had to spit them out cuz I couldn t quite get through it   no bueno.    Service was mediocre not sure what to even expect  so meh. I m good for awhile chipotle .
Chipotle Mexican Grill,62,Honestly one of the worst Chipotle s I ve ever been too. Waited 30 min for an online order  did not taste fresh at all and overall just a bad experience.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,63,We rediscovered Chipotle and didn t die of food poisoning. The good news and bad news is that nothing has changed.  Their food has always been quite tasty and I m super happy that their animals are raised humanely  so it was as good as ever on that front. It s also convenient and the people there are friendly.  The atmosphere is also the same  boooooring. That said tasty beans  yummy meats and fresh produce. I recommend it 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,64,I have been to this location  on Brodie Lane twice. Both times it was dirty. The food area was messy  the floor was dirty  and there were dirty dishes on uncleaned tables. The food was fine but not worth the mess. I would strongly suggest patronizing the South Lamar location.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,65,We ordered two items for pick up. Both items had the correct label but were made wrong. Not only that but the wait was an additional 20 mins. Don t online order from this place.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,66,I ordered a single single burrito on the app yesterday at 3 PM and it told me it was gonna be ready at 3 30 PM. So I show up at 3 30 and the line was very long and my food wasn t ready so I took a seat and waited patiently. I have 10 minutes went by I went up to the front counter and asked if it was ready and the man assured me that it was on the way and they were working on it. I waited another 20 minutes and still nothing so I decided to get in line and order some chips and guac. As I approach the register to pay I told the man that I was still waiting for a burrito from my mobile order and once again he assured me that it would be out soon. I then waited another 20 minutes and still nothing and other people had come in and grab their mobile orders. So once again I go to the front register and ask him about it and he acts completely shocked and tells me he can make it right then and there but after waiting for almost an hour I told him I wanted a refund and I was going to eat somewhere else. I have worked in the food industry for the last 4 years and understand places can get busy. But that is no excuse to not check up on a costumer who has been standing in your lobby for over 40 minutes waiting for his mobile order that he places over an hour ago. I will not be coming back to this chipotle until they fix their management.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,67,I love chipotle  but today was my last trip to this location. Portions are smaller than other locations. I even paid for double steak to have extra for lunch the next day. However  the  double  was an intentional half scoop  I mean he picked up a full spoon and dumped half of it back . When I asked if they could a full serving like the 1st spoonful since I was happy to pay for it... I got a look.   Why I m not going back  Much of the steak  like others have commented  is half fat and it s a 50 50 chance that the meat is actually marinated. Unfortunately both happened again today  so bland 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,68,This location is infuriating to go to. It s seemingly run by disrespectful children who take priority over cracking jokes and talking about customers  instead of handing orders or having any sense of customer service or efficiency. Literally the worst run Chipolte I ve ever been to. Dont go here.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,69,Went in at 10 45 when they opened. The store was very clean  the food very fresh  and most of all very gracious employees. Loved my visit 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,70,I stopped in this chipotle for a late lunch this past Sunday afternoon. Place was a mess. Tables were dirty. There were no utensils stocked. I ordered a chicken bowl with brown rice  black beans and all the veggies and some chips  amp  queso. First off the chips were stale and the queso was luke warm. As fkr tge bowl  I have to say I was surprised by how little chicken they actually put in it. I mean it was very hard finding any chicken in my bowl. It seemed like every spoonful I was eating was mostly rice  beans and veggies. I don t think there was more than 2 oz of chicken in my entire bowl  Has the price of chicken gone up overnight  Or perhaps they re trying to save money by skimping out on people s orders  Maybe they re trying to make up for the money they lost in that food contamination crisis they had a while back. All I know is for  12 and change they should ve put a helluva lot more chicken in my bowl. Well then I guess it s Buh-bye Chipotle   Time to go back to good ol Cabo Bob s   That place is always on point. It s just a farther drive for me. But after this last encounter I de rather drive there. The food tastes better at Cabo Bob s and also seems fresher plus they always pack your food with plenty of protein.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,71,Teenagers  Check  Angsty teenagers  Check  Angsty teenagers that work here that don t really care to make your meal  want to rush you through the line without listening to your order  and give you tiny portion sizes  Check   That checklist has never failed me at this locaiton  I have the same experience every time. Chipolte  however  is freaking delicious  and nothing will deter me from getting my corn salsa fix   So  if you want Chipolte and this is your nearest location  go  It tastes just like the rest of them  Just be prepared to say   Just a little more  please   or  Can I get a lot of sour cream    Yum 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,72,Writing this review makes me so sad        I LOVE Chipotle so much  I have been going to Chipotle for years and have never experienced disappointment until last Thursday. I picked up to burrito bowls for take out. My boyfriend and I were both shocked at the size of the bowl  it s half the size of the normal portion given by Chipotle locations. The tortilla on the side we ordered ended up being 1 single tiny tortilla that you would use for a taco and was hard as a bone. The amount of meat in my boyfriends bowl left a whole lot to be desired.   The only reason why I am giving this a 2 star instead of a 1 star is because of my overall love for Chipotle  but there is NO love for this location. I am deeply disappointed.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,73,Service was not good. Asked for light rice and got about 3 grains of rice--the bottom of the bowl was barely filled. Asked for a side of guac and it was halfway filled up. The guac looked like it was leftover from the night before. We were the first customers of the day--expected much better.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,74,I stopped at this chipotle and bit into my burrito  it contained frozen corn salsa.   It was inedible  even though I m usually not picky  I couldn t eat it.  I quietly took my burrito back to the register and the employee laughed  said he was sorry and proceeded to ignore me.  I continued to stand there in hopes he d either offer to make me a new one  or give me my money back  and he seemed frustrated.  Finally  out of annoyance  he said  do you want a new one or something   As if it was an unreasonable request.  I was so embarrassed and annoyed myself that I just answered no and walked out.  It was terrible customer service.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,75,Probably my worst experience at chipotle. The rice was undercooked and my burrito bowl was flavorless.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,76,Let me start off by saying that I love Chipotle. I ve been going to Chipotle for years. I have lived in Oak Hill for about a year now  and unfortunately this is the closest Chipotle to my house.   They are extremely slow at preparing food  and there s always staff that seems to be standing around doing nothing. The productivity at this chipotle reminds me more of a city construction team than a fast food restaurant.   They are also always out of food. They were out of chips at one point. I asked them how long u till they would be finished  and they said they were not making them the rest of the day.   To top this all off  the staff is often rude. I asked for tomatoes in my burrito  and the rude little child behind the counter said  you mean pico de gallo   No  I mean the other salsa made primarily from diced tomatoes. How about you just make my food and not give me an attitude    Avoid this place if you can 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,77,Horrible  I love chipotle  but this location in particular was horrible.  Walked in today   on Monday at 430pm. This place smelled like a restroom   and there was not one table clean.. although the restaurant was empty.   The floor looked like a kid had a free for all.  Trash cans were pouring over.   Chips were stale.   Sad. ..very sad...   I d give it a zero star of I could.   Talked to the manager and he seemed incompetent.   I had to ask for my refund and stormed out after.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,78,Watch out for the Cockroaches  A cockroach was on the food line counter when I walked up to order  and not even one employee seemed concerned while we watched it crawl on the food counter          I pointed it out and alerted 4 different employees and they acted like it would be a regular event   We waited for someone to apologize or offer some sort of customer serviceinstead all of the employees completely ignored us  Really disappointing 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,79,They get 2 stars for the food but nothing else. This place is dirty  poorly managed  and the workers don t listen to your order. I asked for a kids meal  and the guy was like..  Where is the rest of your meal   when looking at a foiled quesadilla.    Ummm.. You haven t made it yet.  I replied.  then I had to ask for lettuce to be the main ingredient in a SALAD bowl. Like for real  And they acted like I asked for tequila in the dang thing. It s just lettuce    They have a line out the door because they can t serve people quickly. 3 people on the front and 2 in the back not wearing gloves..
Chipotle Mexican Grill,80,Y all the queso tastes like bland chalk dust... even after they have supposedly revised the issue. I d rather go to freebirds.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,81,Don t go to this location  First of all  I have never left a bad review anywhere and Chipotle is my favorite quick place to eat but since I travel a lot  I have eaten at locations all over the U.S  but this particular location is bar-none the worst Chipotle branch I have ever experienced. I have ordered from here many times  in-person mostly with a few times ordering ahead on the app  since moving here this year and every single time they are unprofessional. The past two times I was the only person standing in line and I had to wait for over 5 minutes while the employee ran their cleaning hand towel painstakingly slowly over the counter multiple times  pushing dried corn laying on the metal counter back in with the fresh corn  without ever saying anything to me or giving me eye contact when I stepped up to the counter. Very bizarre. Then they give me smaller portions  half a spoonful  of rice  beans and protein than any other location I ve been to. The cashier lady the past 3 times has TEXTED on her phone while I stand there with my credit card and talks about unprofessional things with her coworker while I wait for her to ring me up. I always ask for lemons at the cashier and all the other locations have always opened up the little fridge behind the counter and handed me one of their pre-cut lemon cups with the lid. This location always tells me I can t have lemons because they didn t have any cut up. One time I politely asked if they could cut a lemon for my lemon water and the cashier ROLLED their eyes at me  went into the back for 3 minutes and handed me a whole lemon in a sauce cup without a lid. I have tried giving them the benefit of the doubt many times at the is location and it is a shame that it is here in particular  would be unfortunate anywhere though  because this is the area most convenient for me to grab lunch dinner  but I won t put up with this unprofessional  RUDE location anymore. Note to MGMT - you need to vet who you are hiring because I know this location has a very high turnover rate and a lot of unhappy customers.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,82,This particular location really skimps you on the meat. Worse than any other Chipotle.  - 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,83,Probably the worst run Chipotle in Austin especially when compared to the great Stassney location.  Rather than write out a long review here is what is wrong at this location  - Bathrooms are almost never clean  sink is all rusty and smells like urine - Often booths are left dirty - How are there ALWAYS crushed chips all over the floors  - Rice is pretty much always low or out so they give meager portions. - They never seem to strain the beans enough so it soaks into my burrito and is a mess if I take it to go. - Ordering online  Why bother. They won t start it until AFTER your pick up time anyways.  Really though the most frustrating thing is the last bullet point. Why even OFFER online ordering if my wait will be longer than if I had just come in and waited in line  This isn t a one time deal either but a repeated and very frustrating problem. NONE of the other locations have this issue and the worst part about it is that I normally order in non peak times like 1 30 PM or 7 PM  and it is STILL an issue.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,84,I had a terrible Chipotle experience at the Sunset Valley location.   First the amount of ingredients I was given in my bowl was definitely less than normal. The chicken was almost out so I got the scraps which was not the usual amount.  The employee doing the vegetables was busy filling guac and salsa cups and finished that before asking me what I wanted.  The last employee I interacted with smelled like cigarettes and was OBVIOUSLY under the influence of drugs. I don t find the smell of cigarettes appetizing  and I think most people would agree with me on that. Not only did he smell like it  but the bowl I got smelled like cigarettes as well.   I also got chips and guac and did not get enough chips.   Overall the amount of food I got was far less consistent that every other Chipotle I ve gone to. The employees did not care about my experience  and they did not act like they cared AT ALL.   This was one of the worst dining experiences I ve ever had and I m very surprised it came at a Chipotle. I don t know who the manager was or if there even was a manager  but it is very disappointing to me that they would let this continue or even start in the first place.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,85,Place was ok  nothing that would make it stand out  next to the other Chipotles. Long line of course  and always out if something. Burrito wasn t hot at all  food tasted kind of bland. Super packed  so not a lot of seating. Wasn t a big fan of this location at all.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,86,Now I realize that evangelizing Chipotle on some level seems akin to blasphemy  what with them once climbing under the covers with the golden arches and all  a union since undone  I believe   and hell  it s a chain.  Reviewing some chains separately  and this one would likely fall under that umbrella  is a little bit of folly.  Bring your meats  beans  salsas  torillas and loads of black  amp  white artwork  snarky typefaces  and corrugated metal   rinse  repeat.    But something occurred to me today when I sat down here for lunch  staving off the last of a heavy duty sugar crash.  I may well prefer Chipotle to  say  Freebirds.  Not a popular opinion  and there certainly aren t the options here you see at FB s.  Certainly isn t the quirky Austin-friendly goofball vibe you get at the other place  but on a day when I needed a big fat taco and enough rice and cilantro to make my face sweat  there was Chipotle  with a heapin  helping of lovin . This week they sent out a free burrito coupon  so everyone and their dog was in there on the cheap  but hey  it s occasionally good to remember that there is such a thing as a free lunch.    Just not often.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,87,Terrible location  dirty tables and sticky floor. Rude unhelpful staff and bad customer service I had. My burrito was cold  when I mentioned that  they just ignored me. The soda station is a mess.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,88,I have been going to Chipotle for years  and almost took a picture of the taco-sized burrito they tried to make me when I ordered online. The staff is rude  they are constantly out of things like Tabasco  and every single one of the workers tries to skimp on every single ingredient like they were trained to withhold food from us or something. This location is an absolute joke and I hope you read this before trying to come here.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,89,Dirtiest  messiest Chipotle I ve ever eaten at   There was unwanted red bell pepper in my beans which the employee picked out with her hand  gloved at least  .  Food items all along the serving area were mixed and spilled.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,90,What is their problem when one person orders for multiple people  e.g. My wife or I order for us and our children   They are always irritated and stressed.  Today they basically insisted we order ahead online.  Say what you will about people from Mexico and South America taking our jobs and all  but since this Chipotle replaced the line servers with  North Americans  the experience has gone down hill for us.  The Hispanic workers are still there cooking in the back and cleaning the restaurant  but the snarly  American  line servers look like deer caught in headlights when things get busy.  Hey Chipotle  take a tip from Freebirds and Torchy s and let your servers smoke a few bowls before work so they mellow out and go with the flow making burritos and tacos 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,91,I ve recently been to this location twice. Both times the employees on the line register have been obnoxious and paid very little attention to me as I was trying to order. They seemed much more interested in their childish conversation than making sure they got my order right.  The food tasted bland compared to other locations. The chicken and fajita veggies were burnt and overcooked. I m very disappointed with this location which is unfortunate because it s the closest one to where I live.  I m a big fan of Chipotle  but I would avoid this location if you can
Chipotle Mexican Grill,92,I really enjoy Chipotle.  For some reason  I feel slightly embarrassed admitting this.  I order the burrito bowl with black beans  no rice  chicken  corn salsa  extra scoop please   tons of cheese  more  more  more   guacamole and lettuce.  The chicken is so good.  It is marinated and grilled to yumminess.  I am not a huge fan of chicken breast  but when it is this flavorful I am.  The corn salsa is delicious and fresh.  The guacamole is one of my favorites and worth the extra charge.    Here is my secret.  I eat my bowl with their tortilla chips  which are delicious with a hint of lime.  I essentially use the bowl as dip.  A friend turned me onto this and I have never looked back.  It is a healthy meal without the tortilla chips  but so much less enjoyable.  I like that they try to be more sustainable and healthy.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,93,Dear Chipotle  I had never eaten at a Chipotle restaurant but had stuck my head in at one nearer my house  Barbara Jordan Blvd. 78723 . One of my friends on staff at my work loves it because the food choices are so healthy. So I decided to try it - the one near me looked great. How about a different one  Sunset Valley   This location was dirty. There were 4-5 booths  either 3-4 were dirty. Food on the seats. The floor was dirty. The other tables hadn t been bussed. Yikes  My husband thought the same.  Why did I stay  My friends were meeting us before our movie and I have lots of food allergies and couldn t find another place in time.   Out of the shoot  no corn tortillas. Apparently you had trouble with your supplier and weren t carrying them anymore. Not so good for someone who needs gluten free but would like a tortilla. The fried ones you had were  fried.  I should have known not to eat one because of the amount of oil that showed when I cracked one in half  not so healthy.  When we asked for salt  we were directed to the drink stand area where there was a small open container of salt - that I - and everyone else in the restaurant would have to pinch with our fingers. It s flu season so I declined. Later our friend asked for some and pointed out that there was only the  let s make people sick  one and was given another open container of salt. Nice for us to have salt - difficult to use amongst four as we didn t want to stick our fingers in it so we poured it in our hands.   It was a horrible first impression. Dirty  unsanitary  and my stomach really hurt that night. Also  I did note that not everyone was wearing gloves as they handled food items.   Read a few of the Yelp reviews  wish I had  apparently  I am not the only one that felt it was sub-sub-par.https   www.yelp.com biz chipotle-mexican-grill-austin osq Chipotle Mexican Grill  P.S. Haven t gotten up the courage to try another Chipotle since I was sick that night  wonder if it was the workers without gloves or the oily tortilla  .
Chipotle Mexican Grill,94,Let me start by saying I love Chipotle. My son and me eat there at least once a week. We usually grab some grub from the restaurant on Lamar. We are always more than completely satisfied with the service  the food  and the portion size. Also the food is always hot and fresh.  Tonight we stopped at the Brodie Lane location. Underwhelmed and disappointed are the first things that come to mind.  I ordered the chicken bowl and my son and his friend had the barbacoa burrito. This was my sons friend first time eating at a Chipotle so we were somewhat excited to introduce him to a great place for an overstuffed burrito.  I should have listened to the voice in my head when I looked at the containers in the serving station. All of the container were do low with contents that I couldn t see the ingredients from the other side of the counter. Anyhow my son ordered first. He had the barbacoa burrito.  The young man behind the counter wasn t putting enough ingredients on the tortilla so I mentioned that he was being a little stingy with the helpings and he just shrugged his shoulders as if to say so what. He didn t put anymore than 1 tablespoon of Barbacoa on the tortilla  not even a good grab with the tongs being use.  My sons friend ordered the same thing with the same result. I wasn t going to order anything for myself. I wish I listened to the voice in my head.  I ended up getting the chicken bowl. The final product was added and the ingredients didn t even reach the rim of the bowl. Now if I didn t know what is usually the standard I may have been okay with the amount of ingredients.  Not only were the amount of ingredients not the usual standard  the food did not have that fresh taste that keeps me coming back.  I just asked my son what he thought of his burrito and his response was   pretty small burrito.  His friends response was  not impressed   Bottom line is food wasn t fresh and portions for the price paid were not what I usually receive from other stores I ve visited-weekly.  So  my advice is to stay away from the Brodie lane store. The kid could have so easily just added more ingredients instead of shoulder shrugging me .  For the price Taco Bell would have been a better choice. At least I wouldn t still be hungry. Who is ever still hungry after eating at Chipotle-usually no one.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,95,Three stars is being generous because when it s good it s good but I have to agree with a lot of the bad reviews for this location.  It s the closest to us and so we order from here a lot because we love the food.  My last three online orders were screwed up.  I had to drive back on one of them because the orders were so screwed up that nobody wanted them  40 minutes round trip .I ve arrived at the house twice now to find the kids build your own box nearly empty.  Tonight s had only the chicken in it and one small tortilla in it.  One of the burritos was so poorly wrapped that it was falling apart.  It wasn t even crowded tonight.  Just sloppiness.  These aren t isolated incidents any more and are becoming more commonplace.  Seems like a lot more supervision is needed here.  I ve had great meals there so I know they can do but it s often a hit and miss.  You guys can do better  come on   And AGAIN   When the manager isn t there it s complete chaos.  The line keeps running out of items.  I ve had people behind the counter double team me on orders so that they distract me on one an then screw up the other.    When the manager is there it all flows well.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,96,They re open until 10  but that doesn t mean they have all the ingredients until closing time. Veggie bowl usually includes guacamole  but not at 9 30. Don t go to this location if you re looking for a late-night spot.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,97,If I could give this Chipotle location 0 stars  I would. It was the absolute worst experience I ve ever had in my life in any food joint.   I am anemic and suffer from low blood sugar if I don t eat every couple hours. Within the span of a couple minutes  my blood sugar dipped and I stumbled and fainted in front of the cashier. I hit my head and was on the ground and no one did A THING. My friend was frantically trying to get my attention and help me up and finally the cashier tells me  doesn t ask  tells me to sit down as if I was fooling around and a huge inconvenience.   To top that  when I finally get to my table with the food  the burrito I ordered had barely any rice  the main part of my burrito since I wanted very little chicken and was almost entirely toppings. My first bite was nothing but pico and I almost threw it up after having my fainting spell.   No one did or said anything at all during this whole ordeal and I am disgusted by the lack of respect from this establishment. I will never be eating here again.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,98,I ve eaten lunch here a few times in the last year.  Food always seems fresh and the service is adequate. I mean you go down the line and they scoop in whatever you want - what could go wrong. I guess the chain survived the poisoning of people since they seem to be busy. I ll go back if I m close at feeding time but I won t go out of my way to get here.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,99,I ve been coming here a lot over past year and I always get the same thing. The bowl over time got smaller and smaller. This is today s  It s just becoming less worth for me to buy it for lunch.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,100,My husband  myself  and my 2 year old ate here for lunch on Saturday 9 8 18. We ALL got food poisoning the following day. I did report this to management.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,101,I m not sure if I ve just been lucky  but I love this location. Their portions are fair  if not generous and I can t say that I ve gotten bad service - which I totally have at other places. I will drive all the way across town to this location until they give me a reason not to.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,102,I m guessing this place pays their employees next to nothing judging from the horrible customer service provided by the staff.  Food is average at best here but this is my 3rd and last visit here due to the poor service.  Or maybe they are all deaf     Oh how I wish Baja Fresh or Rubio s was nearby
Chipotle Mexican Grill,103,I love Chipotle  and frequent different locations around Austin regularly.  The Brodie location is the worst in town. The staff is consistently rude  online orders are incorrect  and the quality of the food is much lower than other locations in town.   Drive an extra few miles to Lamar for a better burrito.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,104,I love chipotle  but this particular store is VERY POORLY MANAGED. I m giving it couple more years before it closes for lack of Management if they don t take dramatic measures to turn the store performance around.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,105,I just went here to grab lunch before coming home and got my order to go. I didn t realize till I got home my food was cold. Since it was just after 11am my guess is they had left over meat from last night and pulled it out of the fridge to serve for lunch today. I guess it hadn t warmed up yet. For a company that prides itself on fresh  ingredients left overs from the night before are not fresh. This is one of the worst meals I ve wasted  10 on. My beans and rice were not hot either. When I say my food was cold in spots I mean cold.  Not luke warm but cold.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,106,They have crappy corn tortillas  it fell apart when I picked it up after waiting in line 25 minutes. They used to have good food  but today crappy.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,107,Chipotle is my go to when I need something fast and relatively healthy. I normally run by the store on south Lamar  but decided to stop at the one at sunset valley because it was closer.  Never again  The standards of Chipotle definitely don t apply to this location. First initial impression  they were out of lettuce. How does that happen  I told them I would wait for them to cut more and their response was  It will be awhile because we have to wash it 3 times.  What  Okay so I had to get shredded lettuce for my salad  I ll live. After my order was completed  I stood at the cashier line and waited for someone to help me  for what seemed like 4 or 5 minutes. To my surprise  that person was loading and unloading dirty trays while they watched me wait. Also  while looking around I discovered how filthy everything was around me. Food all over the floor and a completely unorganized team running the line. If the cashier was at least pleasant  I probably wouldn t have wrote this review. However  she was quite rude and barely looked up at me or made eye contact while taking my money. I am still in the parking lot while writing this review because I am so appalled at the experience I just had. Definitely will not be back to this location 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,108,I Placed an order online and it wasn t made when I got there. That s fine. Guy at the counter proceeds to serve 15 people in line after being told that I m there and waiting on my food. I won t be back here.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,109,I realized all of my reviews are positive and I need to balance that out by reviewing some of the  businesses I was not impressed with. This Chipotle location came to mind first. Consistently sloppy  luke warm cold burritos. And don t even think about ordering a quesadilla to go  unless you just want to eat it from the bottom of the bag with a spoon.  Why do I still go here  My family loves Chipotle. I like Chipotle as a whole just fine. This one.... thumbs down with a fart noise. It doesn t matter. No one checks the reviews on Yelp before ordering Chipotle.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,110,Compared to the other Chipotles I ve been to  this one seems slightly larger and capable of handling the large lunch crowd.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,111,The workers were using bleach at 7 30pm and the smell was over powering the food. Aren t they suppose to wait till they are closed  The outside area was so dirty and needed to be cleaned.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,112,This is THE worst location I have ever bought food from. I went to this location to try another chipotle location other than the good south lamar location. BIG MISTAKE. First off their food tasted gross. Just plain and no flavor. Haven t been back since and don t plan on it. My only complaint was about the food. Seems this location has LOTS of problems though.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,113,Been here many time. However  today line workers were soooooO slow....molasses city usa  Mainly there were two too many working the line...tripping over each other and no elbow room to scoop food items.  Also  I did not recognize any faces...Second reason line movement was slow...slowest meat scooper ever. She must have thought she was the protein picasso  4 Stars for food  2 Stars for line workers
Chipotle Mexican Grill,114,Will never go back   The poor staff was completely untrained. We got home with a burrito that was split apart and had to be eaten like a salad  bowl of mush  and my bowl consisted of a few grains of rice dotted with steak but piled high with lettuce and corn   I tried to tell the kid it was not right but he was so nervous I just gave up. Done 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,115,Seems inconsistent on the quality and service front. Not worth my time to review but definitely worst Chipotle I ve been to 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,116,Love this place   The line can be a little long at times but worth the wait. The food is always amazing. I get the same thing now every time I go but many other things there look really good as well. The place is always clean and the service is fast. The staff is friendly. I have no complaints about this place other then I have to pay extra for their amazing guac and that they have no queso option. If chipotle was to do queso I would probably be buying it every time I went. Over all though the portions are generous for what you pay. I give this place a two thumbs up 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,117,Just a quickie  Yummy deliciousness - as I find at most Chipotles.  However  the customer service at this location is 5 Star.  About a week ago  one of the burritos  contained the wrong meat  I should have noticed  but instead  believing that as a woman I could multi-task with two different orders  talking on the phone  and searching through my purse for my method of payment...I somehow missed it during the burrito building process   Today  my dinning companion  nicely mentioned the mess up and the manager was more than friendly.  He comped my companions burrito and informed us that he would take care of us the next time we came in.  Awesome -- seriously great service that will keep me coming back to this location for sure.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,118,Burrito bowls are the way too go. Always filling. This Chipotle is a great franchise with hard working staff. Fresh ingredients and honest marketing menus. Clean restaurant and fast service  though sometimes there is a rush at lunch and the line gets crazy. I m a regular here.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,119,Incoming Chipotle Virgin    I recently watched an episode of Oprah where the founder of Chipotle was on and talking about the fresh  hormone free  local  sustainable  organic  bla bla bla integrity of Chipotle. Intrigued that you can get fast food  from a large chain  that is so wholesome  I had to try it. I had avoided them in the past  because I thought I was going to get a burrito the size of my arm  like at FreeBirds  and that has never appealed to me.   So if you have never been here... the menu looks like a secret society cult menu... You have to know how to read it. Enter nice older gentleman behind me in line to assist.   --  Nice Older Gentleman    6.25 gets you a Burrito  2 tacos  a bowl OR a Salad and you get to pick the meat and other ingredients. Add  1.75 if you want Guacamole.   Me   So it s kind of like FreeBirds but you don t have to get the jumbo burrito    Nice Older Gentleman   Exactly.   Me   Seems like too much food.   Nice Older Gentleman   My co-worker gets the salad so she can save the rest for leftovers.   Me   Good idea. Do you think I can get tortillas on the side to build my own tacos    Nice Older Gentleman   I think so.   Me   Thanks    Me   feeling all expert now  ordered a salad with 1 2 steak and 1 2 Carnitas  light black and pinto beans  peppers and onions  toasted chili-corn salsa and fresh tomato salsa  aka. pico de gallo   cheese and lettuce. On the side  sour cream   Tomatillo Green Chili Salsa  and 2 corn tortillas.   --  Loud clap  thunder  the skies opened up...  literally  it began to rain outside . I headed home with my healthy  taco kit  and gobbled down 2 tacos and there was enough left  if I had more tortillas to make 4 more . OK  So I was being all  girl healthy dainty  and thought I would save the rest  but I ate it with a fork. You could make 2 meals out of it...  4-6 tacos depending on the tortillas  but the damn Carnitas are so addicting  I could not stop myself. They were moist  mouth watering and perfectly seasoned.   I wonder how much just the Carnitas sell for  by the pound           My name is Darla A. and I am no longer a Chipotle Virgin... and it was definitely good for me. I will be returning... multiple times.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,120,I enjoy being able to eat Chipotle on just about every corner in Austin.  It never fails that the line is quick  the food is tasty and the workers are happy 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,121,Like Camron  I got a coupon for a free burrito in the mail yesterday. And judging by how packed it was at lunch yesterday  I m guessing everyone in my zip code got a coupon for a free burrito.  The food here is good  but it lacks all the options you can get at a local burrito place  like Freebird s  for instance. Only 1 type of tortilla  1 type of cheese  2 choices of beans  etc. They do make up for it  by stuffing that burrito to its limits.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,122,After reading reviews on yelp for places to go and celebrate birthdays  you know places that offer birthday deals  I stopped into this Chipotle because I heard they had a birthday special on Yelp. After I told the cashier it was my birthday she asked the manager and his response to me was  are you used to people giving you free burritos on your birthday     I was under the impression that Chipotle has a birthday special and I guess I made a mistake but that was no reason for them to be mean.  So I paid for my friends burrito and left. That was my first and last time at Chipotle.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,123,I love Chiptole. I know that is blasphemous in this land of amazing tacos  i.e. Central Texas   but you ll be hard pressed to find another taco place that offers tasty responsibly raised   grown food with such a small impact to your wallet.    Having said that  I have found this particular location of Chipotle to be awful. Given that it is so close to me  I still visit it once a week... but I m trying to cut back because I get more frustrated with every visit.  I have several complaints  but I ll focus on two. First  if you arrive for lunch before 11 45  you ll find that many of the food options have yet to be prepared. I recently showed up at 11 30 for lunch and 3 of the 5 proteins had not yet been cooked. The fajita veggies had also not been cooked. Come on  It isn t like I walked in the moment you unlocked your doors. Second  and more importantly... I question how clean the food prep-area is because I saw a roach. Ugh. For this reason my wife refuses to eat there anymore. I m honestly not sure why I do.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,124,chipotle is my happy place.   doctor visit. sick day from work. got medicine from walgreens. passed out in my bed. woke up hungry. drove to chipotle to get food because it was all I could think about. drove home. ate part of my burrito bowl. climbed back in bed.   good day or bad day  chipotle is a great addition. my usual is a massive burrito bowl. The brodie location has great staff--they are friendly and for me give HUGE portions. I m talking...burrito bowl that last 3-4 meals.   steak burrito bowl rice black beans corn  pico and green salsa cheese sour cream lettuce  SO TASTY    I love that their ingredients are fresh  they move people through the line quickly and efficiently  without being rude   and you don t have to sign your credit card receipt. yum yum yum. leftovers tonight.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,125,Staff is friendly enough. Very unorganized. There was a funky smell today  think wet-dog meets spoiled seafood. I love chipotle. After visiting the newer chipotle on Riverside last week I was craving another bowl today. My wife and I went to dine-in but because her being 6months prego we couldn t due to the awful smell. We got it to go. Dude was nice  all workers had gloves  there was a line about 20people deep. It was 645p. The line did move fast. But they food prep was rushing the order that he didn t ask about lettuce  guacamole or salsa. I had to ask him for salsa and received the  why didn t you say something earlier  look. I didn t even bother with the lettuce and guac. My wife gave me the  we re not coming to this location again.   19 from me and we weren t satisfied. I admire chipotle and love what they stand for. For food they get one star. For location they get one star. Frequent this area so maybe in a few months things will be better.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,126,Chipotle is my crack. I swear they add some secret drug to the salsa that makes me crave a burrito bol. While I feel a little weird reviewing a  gasp  national chain  I am compelled to share the beauty of Chipotle with the non believers.   The food  is awesome. The sour cream is creamy and tangy  the salsas are fresh and flavorful  and the cilantro lime rice is the ONLY rice I will eat in a burrito. The guacamole is the only guac I actually crave - for some reason I never feel the guac I get at local Tex Mex places is fresh like the stuff at Chipotle. Do you wanna know my order  Every time I get a Burrito Bol  no rice  just fajita veggies  black beans  roasted corn salsa  pico de gallo  sour cream  cheese  guac  and lettuce.  Pure vegetable heaven in a bol.   The service  I ve never had any problems with the service at this  Chipotle location. At lunchtime it seems like the entire population of Sunset Valley wants a burrito. So order online or fax your order in. I also love the fact that I don t get weird stares from the staff when I give them my unconventional order  see above   just smiles.   The location  Is close to my condo  but traffic around this area is horrible during lunch time. Horrible I tell you. The streets resemble my  arteries post-queso consumption. Sometimes I don t want to go to Chipotle because I hate the lunchtime and weekend traffic in this area so much. But alas. A pilgrim must suffer in order to reach the holy burrito grail. Onward  burrito devotees 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,127,I agree with the others who say that nationwide Chipotle is great  but this location has sanitary issues. For one  the restrooms are often out of soap. That may not be the biggest deal until you realize that the employees probably use the same restrooms. Eww    Let s just hope that none of them have to go number two during work hours ....  Also the rice is often undercooked and they run out of supplies a lot. I love the reviewer who was told by the manager to just eat her salad with a spoon. The tables stay dirty and most patrons just end up cleaning off the tables from the previous customers just so they can sit down and eat. Twice we paid for items that were not received. Today our kids sat and waited for their quesadillas and they finally arrived burnt to a crisp  We told them we couldn t eat those and they said they would bring new ones out but forgot about them again.   Unfortunately this store is not managed well. we used to visit often but will probably stop going now.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,128,My  ex boyfriend would live here if he could.  He would eat Chipotle for breakfast  lunch and dinner.  He d never get sick of it. On a whole  Chipotle s got something for everyone.  The tacos are yummy  I like the corn  amp  mango salsa.  I also really like the rice that they put in their burritos. Their meat is fresh and their guacamole and chips are mouth-watering good.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,129,Today I went to this Chipotle. I got my veggie burrito  and as the guy was folding it  the side slit open a bit. I told him it was fine  I was going to eat it with a fork and didn t want to be wasteful. Before I knew it 3 people were fussing at me about how they can t serve it to me and how horrible it is. I insisted it was fine and that I really wanted it and didn t want to waste a tortilla for no reason. Finally they gave it to me  but said they couldn t charge me for it. What was it  garbage    I think this is one instance of a larger food issue in America. Why when the side of a tortilla splits is a burrito suddenly worthless  It is ridiculous and absolutely stupid. Food is not infinite  it is finite  and it depends on many other finite resources.   This wouldn t be a big deal to other people  but I guess as the daughter of a farmer and as someone who believes in sustainable food  they picked the wrong customer to act this way with today.   The burrito was good though. I honestly would ve rather just paid for it and had a normal eating experience. But I guess not being wasteful is no longer normal.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,130,I am not a fan of this location. Came here at an off peak time and do not remember having too much of a problem with the service. One big issue I did have however  was with the portion size. Chipotle is known for their huge overstuffed burritos which typically leave me full for the rest of the day. This was not the case here.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,131,UGH... and this is coming from someone who dreams about Chipotle burritos...  Good  Your typical ingredients. Clean location.  Bad  The service  They were terrible. They had 3 workers standing around. One must ve just gotten on her break... since another one was taking LITERALLY 5 minutes to carefully stuff that other lady s 3 tacos. The lines were getting long and they all just completely regarded everyone else. I ve never seen any employees at another Chipotle location look like they hate their job so much  It really makes me hate coming here too. My boyfriend and I decided that we re never coming back. They gave the PUNIEST burrito ever. Seriously - taco bell style.  sigh. and i love chipotle   
Chipotle Mexican Grill,132,I have always loved chipotle  It s my go to place when I m in need of something quick. This location is in a busy shopping center but I ve never had trouble with parking or the line being too long  Very friendly employees... My only complaint was I noticed the drink area was pretty dirty 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,133,When I am craving Mexican food and  need food fast I head here. On my way there I decide what I want Burrito  Taco or Salad.  I get in line and proceed down the line up of food choices as the guy gal behind the food bar builds a meal designed specific to my taste buds.  On my most recent visit I ordered a romaine salad and added chicken  very nicely seasoned marinated  pinto beans  jack cheese  and the salsa with corn.  Very good and what I would consider a light Tex-Mex meal - no need for a siesta afterward     Forgot to add Cheap meal  
Chipotle Mexican Grill,134,Staff is generally upbeat but not quite as professional as other stores.  Cleanliness of the restroom grades just above roadside filling station  not smelly but definitely not maintained. Never seen this in a chipotle before .  Outside dining area is a mess  amp  tables not maintained well.  Portion size is small especially considering extra charge for the guacamole.  Food is good.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,135,This place is awesome  It s pretty much like any other Chipotle  which would warrant a 5 star rating from me too  unless something was off  but I ve never experienced this .  I m not a rice and beans in my sandwich kind of person  I need CRUNCH  so I tend to opt for the fajitas with grilled onions and green peppers or the salad bowls. I ve had the chicken and steak and both are really yummy  as are all the other ingredients. The salad bowls are pretty good too and their slightly tangy honey something dressing is absolutely delicious.   It also makes me feel good eating something that s really healthy for me  their sandwiches taste good without being loaded with fatty dressing    And you can t beat the prices either  it s extremely reasonable for how much food you get. I can t usually eat a whole burrito in one seating    The service is always fast and efficient and the food is always consistently good. I will be back here again and again and again.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,136,It s just like all the other chipotles I ve been too. Good food  decent service  clean establishment and overpriced guacamole.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,137,As others have stated  this is one of the worst run locations of Chipotle s in Austin. I had stopped eating at this location prior to all the food safety issues last year  mostly because the lines were always long and slow. Additionally  when you finally got to order your food -- I go for the bowls -- you d have to practically beg to get more than half a spoon of rice and beans. Staffing hint  a goth waif verging on anorexia is probably not the best person to be portioning out the food. And even with the stingy portions  they still managed to always be out low on some ingredient  rice  beans  meat  sauce  etc .   So  fast-forward to last night when I was running errands in the area. I thought  instead of hitting the good Mama Fu s or the excellent Tarka for dinner  I d check out how Chipotle was doing. I cruised by in the car first to check if it had the same long line. Surprisingly  there was no line  not sure if I just timed it right  or if all the bad press has taken it s toll. I went in. First thing I noticed was that the staff looked new. The waifish rice-nazi wasn t there. I walked right up to the counter hoping for a better experience. Nope. It took more than a minute to start my order  because that s how long it took the girl to wrestle her rubber plastic gloves on. If I hadn t been hungry  it would have been comical. Second problem  again  stingy portions    I asked for double chicken in my bowl  and got two spoons maybe 2 3rds full. Sigh. This was most surprising given all the  free food  campaigns they ve done recently. The final issue was an overly animated and friendly cashier. If it has seemed genuine  that would have been one thing  but it seemed force -- and a bit creepy. Like the staff had been ordered to be  Happy  happy  happy  with the customers  or risk getting an electric shock as punishment.   So  I ve written this Chipotle location off. If I want a burrito  I ll stick with Freebirds or one of the other Chipotle locations. Better yet  I ll go to a  real  Tex-Mex place.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,138,This chiplotle location deserves like negative a gagillion stars  They have the ABSOLUTE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE. I know I am not at freaking Uchi or Uchiko but this is worse than ANY fast food joint I ve ever been to. Everytime you go  the line is outrageously long -- not bc it s busy but bc the employees are DAMN SLOW. Today is the last time I will go to this location. Today I was about to blowup and insisted to see a manager  but for me -- my lunch break is only 30 minutes  I work nearby . And more than half of that time is spent in the line  So I had no time to argue.  I ve been here many times  and it is consistently bad. But what happened today  I finally got someone to take my order after standing in line for like over 20 minutes. So a nice polite blond chick starts my salad bowl  then hands it to the next dude. And I m waiting for this dude to start asking me other toppings to put in. And the blond chick keeps sliding the other customers food along. So  I patiently still wait  but in my head im like... uh...what is this dude waiting for  So the blond chick obviously took control of situation and started putting my meat on salad and the next customers toppings. And the dude BLOWS UP at her   EXCUSE ME  I DON T TELL U WHAT TO DO. HERE S THE LINE BETWEEN YOU AND ME  YOU DO YOUR JOB AND I DO MINE  STOP INTERFEREING WITH MY DUTIES   etc...  in this childish  loud and dramatic way   that stunned me and the customers next to me  He was throwing a huge tantrum  embarassed himself  and the blond co-worker. I couldn t believe how unprofessional he was and what I was witnessing. I felt so bad for the  blond chick. She continued to be professional  smiled  and tried to like calm him down and assessed the situation   while still trying to take people s orders. And me   I M STILL WAITING FOR YOU TO PUT TOPPINGS ON MY SALAD DUDE. Looking at my watch - I only have like 10 left to eat  So I go  Um Can you put topings for me   And he obviously is upset at everyone and like throws corn onto my salad and like slides it to the next person and she finishes my bowl finally. That whole tantrum took a lot of time  I was so upset - I couldn t even finish my food    AND NOW I KNOW WHY the line is always so long and slow here. Because this location hires IDIOTS AND DRAMATIC UNPROFESSIONAL people      Wasiting customers times with your damn drama. Take that to the back of the house. Where the hell is the manager ANYWAY   I bet this dude would ve been fired on the spot if the manager was present. And now I just read all these other yelp reviews how this place is roach infested  UGH  This place needs to be shut down 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,139,This popped up on my check-in list so I might as well review...but this will be short.  Chipoodle is easily my favorite  fast food  place because   1  It is  Food with integrity   I appreciate Chipotle s mission and goals  2  I can stick to my Paleo plan and order a salad bowl and get a tasty lunch while avoiding those items I wish to  3  Guacamole. Yup  even though it s  1.50 extra. 4  It s quick and easy  line always moves fast 5  There is always one last parking spot 6  There is always a seat and a Chronicle 6  Margaritas  at a fast food joint  Score 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,140,This location is awesome and consistent as others have posted.  All food is fresh and they never scrape the bottom of the barrel for your order.  I always have to park in the Subway parking lot during lunch because Chipotle is so busy.  Fast and friendly staff.   A 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,141,This location is not bad for a cheap lunch  but sometimes I have gotten meat that was a bit dried out  veggies that were burned  and the staff does not seem particularly happy to be there. I mean  who could blame them  But at least fake it.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,142,Yes  it s a chain. No  I am not ashamed to be reviewing this chain. Because it s SO. DAMN. GOOD.  Most people have probably been here multiple times by now  but if you are one of  those  that have not...seriously missing out.  You really can t get more fresh than this place. All of their ingredients are made daily  and you can tell by the taste and appearance. Their burritos  tacos  amp  burrito bowls are all so yummy  no matter what you put in them. I ve only had their chicken and pork  because I can t bring myself to try the other meats  which I ve also heard are delicious  just because I am so stuck on my  usual.    The staff is always so friendly  every single time and they do not skimp on anything. It s also very cheap for the amount you are getting. Great for lunch and an empty stomach 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,143,Been to. A LOT of Chipotles before. This is by and far the slowest. Ever. 30  minute wait and that was with 3 people working the line. Make that 4. The line weaved through the restaurant. Find another location.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,144,This is a fairly typical Chipotle.  The food always seems fresh and tastes great.  I usually get the same thing  a veggie bowl  and it seems consistent most of the time.  The service is pretty hit or miss  but it does seem to be better lately.  When my husband and I first started going a couple of years ago  it seemed like the people there didn t like their job or weren t interested in making your food.  Occasionally the portion sizes are off  but if you ask for more they will usually give you more  unless it s meat or guac.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,145,When we first moved to south Austin we started going to this Chipotle. Staff was friendly and food was good. But we ve had bad experiences since there was a change in staff. The manager with the mustache one time didn t listen to my order and had to remake my bowl three times because he was too busy talking to other staff . Then tried to argue with me when I said I didn t want the chicken   which he kept putting in my bowl   because it gave me bad heartburn his reply was like well it all has the same seasoning. The cashiers don t know how to ring up stuff properly and have overcharged a few times. I m  disappointed in the way this location has gone downhill. Chipotle is a great company but they need to retrain this store.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,146,For the most part I ve tried the whole menu the consistency at this location can be off  perhaps due to changes in the cooks  A few times I walked in they had water leaking out into the lobby floor from the back area. This not good for sanitary reasons. No complaints on the food other than Ty consistency. Service is great.whenever I get a quesidilla I do however sometimes get different price some around  4 sometimes close to  7 and that is for a large with chicken. I always dispute it and let then know what I paid last time. Overall I do recommend place outside of lunch hours  because it gets very busy.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,147,Just had the least flavorful burrito of my life. Additionally  the guy who fixed my meal adjusted his hat with the same gloves on that he made my burrito with. Fun times 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,148,I have enjoyed Chipotle for many years.  However  I will not be returning to this location.  Like the other recent Yelpers  I too had a bad experience today at this location.  The store smells of dirty mop water and the floor looked like it had not been swept.  Employees seemed more interested in talking to each other than taking orders and getting them correct. I had to repeat myself twice to two different people.  My to-go order was cold and the chips were stale.  Chipotle  please take a look at management at this location and get it cleaned up   In the meantime  I ll stick to the other eateries in the area.  There are too many other great choices to waste money in this  particular store.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,149,Shameful   Just came here for a much anticipated dinner and was dissapointed from the second i walked in.  A very musty  wet rag smell was in the air.  As i got in line  the guy behind the counter that starts your order was just there talking to his buddy and not paying attention.  I took several minutes for him to finally look at us and even then he waited unitl he fully put on his gloves to talk and start taking the order.  After we completed our order  we walked to sit at a booth but it was dirty.  Went over to a second booth  also dirty.  We looked around and that s when we noticed that all the booths and tables were filthy.  The floors looked like a kid has a free for all and no one had swept the floor since lunch time  it was 430 when i went   we grabbed some napkins and cleaned a table so we could sit down.  I asked to talk to the manager  when he finally arrived i told him my concerns about the cleaniness of the resturant.  He just looked at me without any emotion and said ill let my people know and walked off.  When it came to the food the bags of chip that we had gotten were both stale and did not taste fresh.  This was a bit too much to take we asked for our money back and left...the girl at the counter didn t  seem to happy that we asked for our money back and basically just shoved the money back in my hand.  Not good for a place that holds itself on high food standards.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,150,live roaches  i wish i could leave no stars  found a live roach in my food  most disgusting experience ever
Chipotle Mexican Grill,151,Slowest chipotle I ve ever seen. Standing in line right now watching 4 people trying to handle a line of at least 25 people with the pace of a sloth. Where is their manager  Why isn t anyone picking up the pace  Get moving people 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,152,This continues to be the worst chipotle. The young man wrapping up my order gave it to the person after me and gave me her food. Got home and it was not even close to my meal. Portions are weak... you pay extra for guac and you still get half a dollop. Manager and ownership suck.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,153,I went in April 13  2015 and ordered a burrito bowl. I paid for my food and was about to take it to a table when I saw a live cockroach on the counter. An employee killed it  did not disinfect the area.  Who knows if he washed his hands before serving more food     I took my food and attempted to find a table. Every booth and table was dirty. Dried hit sauce  cheese  on every table. Meanwhile  the employees were hanging out at one booth not doing their jobs.  I took the uneaten food to the register and got a refund. I also asked for the manager. I tried to show her that the cleanliness was an issue at the restaurant and that I would contact the health department. She said that I didn t need to be upset because I got a refund. And this is a manager    I contacted their corporate office and they have responded via email but claim when they call my phone isn t working. So I will just assume they are not disgusted by the situation.  Will not eat there again.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,154,So apparently I m a late bloomer to Chipotle because this year was the first time I ve ever been.......why did i wait so long.  My life is now complete  thanks chipolte   Everything is so yummy  and i just found out all the meat is naturally raised and everything is organic. Not to mention patron margaritas.  This is the best place for my new thyroid gluten free diet. who could ask for more 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,155,Usually a pretty good location but today at 4pm not so good  No veggies and they did apologize or seam to care and food was barely warm.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,156,Burrito bowl      Love it that they use free range products and no antibiotics 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,157,Chipotle has always been great  The food at this location is my favorite and the service is fast  as always . The only drawback is the long line I often face when I m craving Chipotle the most. But  thanks to ordering online  that problem is no longer an issue.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,158,Soooo.... I ve never really had a bad experience with Chipotle  and I m sad to have to write this.  I literally just left there with a salad and the lettuce was disgusting.  They were out of lettuce from the beginning of the line  so the guy went down to the end and got some...it looked wilted and more yellows than green.  I should have spoken up.  Got home  had a bite or two and threw the rest away.  Low standards on fresh lettuce Chipotle...
Chipotle Mexican Grill,159,Literally the worst customer service EVER  They were rude to my mom and me all because we showed up early to pick up an online order. Also refused to serve me and my friends because we can in 10 minutes before they technically opened. So we walked over to Mama Fu s and they were happy to serve us before they opened.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,160,The food is always fresh at Chipotle  any franchise  for that matter. Yet  I am still to get a properly wrapped burrito from this  and other Chipotle franchises  that does not fall apart. The quantity of food that goes into the burrito might have an effect in the difficulty of actually keeping everything nicely packed in with the tortilla. A burrito that size wrapped in aluminum foil should look like a big silver bullet and not like a bunch of stuff bundled in a piece of foil. I will be back  sight  as I have not found a place in Austin with a decent burrito that is fresh and that is aesthetically pleasing to the eye.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,161,Was my first visit ever to a Chipotle  and was very pleased. Everything was so fresh and flavorful. The entire restaurant was spotless. The associate serving us explained the process to this newbie.  Had a bowl with carnitas  veggies  rice  beans  cheese  green salsa  and the roasted corn topping. The carnitas were moist and well seasoned. Everything blended together  and the corn add just a touch of sweetness. Couldn t finished it all. An associate manager stopped by for a visit  which it s always nice. Looking forward to going again.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,162,I love this Chipotle location.  I don t know what it is but they seem to do burritos tacos just a little bit better than the other locations.  The staff really know how to roll a burrito and definitely do not skimp on the portions.  At some point I was put on their mailing list and get offers for buy one get one burritos every once in a while in the mail.  You can t beat that.  Their ingredients are always fresh and the prices are cheap.  I could eat Chipotle every day if it wouldn t result in me gaining astronomical amounts of weight.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,163,This location has roaches  My family and I finished our food when we spotted a medium size roach roaming our booth. We will not be returning to this location. Come on Chipotle 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,164,If you want great carnita or barbacoa  GO HERE       There food is moist and fresh every single time and their customer service is great.  I hadn t been here in a while but ate it last night.  I always get the crispy tacos the best  .    The last time I was here though  they gave you 4 tacos and now you only get three and they have raised their prices.  The guy told me the tacos are bigger and they give more meat no they aren t and no they don t .......I d still go back because it s the best meat you re going to get 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,165,This is one of my all time favs to eat at. You really never have to worry about waiting too long to order your food. They serve fast to keep the line moving  since it s very popular  and great food  I m not one to eat spicy foods and their food isn t very spicy  but I m a sweatter and hate sweating while I m eating. My favorite dish is the Carnita bowl  with white rice  pinto beans  a little cheese  and sour cream...yum yum     I ve had their tacos too. It s pretty rare for them to run out of a meat  because the line crew always stay on point to keep the line moving. So  really you can t go wrong here  fast service and good  fresh ingredients made right in front of you.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,166,The food is cheap. Staff is very friendly. Great Fajitas Bowl. The chips are good as long you love lots of salt on them. The guacamole is good also and the place clean. Lots of parking space in the area.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,167,I ve probably been to half a dozen Chipolte stores. The quality and uniformity tends to be pretty good from store to store. But this one on Brodie Lane is not good. The tables  chairs  floors  windows are dirty. Portions stingy  food is cold  employee attitudes colder. We tried it twice and won t go back.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,168,Tried Chipotle twice  and twice this place served us bitter charcoal which started life as fajita vegetables before being burned black. Even at its best  this place can t hold a candle to great local taquerias like Taco Deli. We won t be giving Chipotle a third chance.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,169,Something has changed in the last few months.  New staff  Yes. New management  Yes. Remodeled kitchen   serving area  Yes.  Has this changed my opinion on this particular Chipotle   YES.  I m really glad to see that this place has gotten better with all of the issues in my previous post and will continue to keep coming here for my Chipotle fix.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,170,My son and I were eating dinner the other day and he mentioned how he missed San Francisco burritos which we used to probably eat at least once a week. These are far from the best burritos Ive ever had but they are not bad either.  A burrito from here equals dinner plus a lunch leftover for me  so not a bad deal plus I can indulge the kid in his San Francisco cravings. I am bitter that I let my free burrito coupon expire even though I had it hanging on the fridge for weeks. Maybe they will send me another one.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,171,I love Chipotle    but it needs some management.  The dining area was a big mess.  A pile of beans on a chair   food all over the floor   trash overflowing...   And then   the workers were a mess.  Chewing gum   nasty dirty shirts and shorts.   This place needs some corporate oversight.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,172,This is a great place to get filled up without emptying the wallet. Yesterday my husband and I were full for hours after splitting a burrito.  We also got chips  salsa and guacamole all for under  10.  I have to say  the service is great too. Even at different locations  the managers are always present and eager to explain.  The only complaint was a sticky table but  we can overlook that.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,173,I passed by this place for years before trying it  thinking that is just another stupid burrito place.  Man was I surprised about a year ago when I finally gave it a try.  I ve never had a bad experienc e here and was totally addicted for a time  but now I go less often.  I don t know what is the  secret ingredient  as someone has said on these reviews.  Somehow  the simple goodness is all there is to it.  I recently tried to make a burrito at home the same way that they do it and it came pretty close.  I just never though to put things together that way.  Here is what I get.  Chicken burrito with rice  black beans  chicken  chunky salsa  mild   cheese and lettuce.  That s it  and it s fabulous.   If there is a secret ingredient  it is the Jasmine rice with lime juice and cilantro.  That is what makes it so special I think  and why my homemade version came so close.   I also get chips and chunky salsa to go with it.  The chips are overcrusted with big salt crystals  which is fantastic.  I like salt stuck to my chip.  Chips need salt.  These burritos are huge and I split one with my wife.  As a younger fella  I would have killed a whole one myself  but now I have got watch the calories.  You ll be over a thousand calories if you eat a whole one.   Or 22  Weight Watcher points  almost a day s worth.   The Dr. Pepper at this place is really  really good fountain soda.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,174,That place was dirty  dirty  dirty. Plus being out of forks  beef and water   Hard to eat a salad with a spoon   Bathroom was nasty--hadn t been cleaned in a while   I won t go back  
Chipotle Mexican Grill,175,This Chipotle location has really taken a nosedive  in my opinion.  Our last time here it took literally 10 minutes to place our order  not a complicated order  I just wanted a combination of corn and flour tortillas   on top of that one of the  employees was cleaning dirty tables  emptying trashcans and prepping food  all without a single hand wash.   We let all  that go and tried again today.  The chicken was burned and the line employee gave my wife  a lot of attitude for requesting new chicken.  When they refused to put out fresh chicken  my wife switched to steak instead.  The employee continued to press my wife  insisting the chicken wasn t burned  merely charred .  I think we will stick to the Southpark Meadows location.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,176,That make and serve a great product.  I work close and they are always friendly and fast with service so I can enjoy my lunch at leisure.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,177,Chipotle is Chipotle  but this Chipotle has a really good attitude about customer service. They take care of problems in a  hassle-free manner.   They re also fast and the food is good.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,178,The place smells as if they use old products to wipe down the tables and or mop... This doesn t help when the kitchen seems dirty too
Chipotle Mexican Grill,179,Dirty  untrained  and mismanaged. Easily the worst chipotle I ve been too and I ve been to many. This used to be a decent location but the turnover of the staff has made everything suffer from inattentive service to the poorer than normal quality of the food. Got fajita veggies in my bowl the other day and got large hunks of onion stuck together in massive bundles. Been to some chipotles with suspect service but never a chipotle with food quality issues until this location. The managers don t know how to ring up a side of rice and beans rather they charge for a veggie bowl which is a  4 difference. A gentlemen up front stood there and did nothing while our food sat on the counter next to the bag  and when we told him that was our order he nudged the food in our direction still out of the bag  not to mention they still hadn t put the chips we paid for in the bag...or the guac. THIS CHIPOTLE NEEDS HELP.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,180,My wife is making me write this review  because she s brushing her teeth.  She was very impressed to see the Brodie Ln. Chipotle staff using sign language with a customer today - apparently listing ingredients.  My wife is the kind of person who likes to acknowledge the good in the world - me not so much  what I mean to say is she acknowledges me  but that I don t really like acknowledging do-gooders.   I personally thought the food was great and they were very nice to sell us sliced avocado  not on the menu  for our baby.  I have deducted one star for the surprise trifecta of no soap  no toilet paper and no paper towels in the bathroom.  So  there... I hope you re happy Chipotle 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,181,I stared at the burrito man when we started to build my food and told him more more more more more and by the end of it all I had was a tortilla with rice in it  I think it was my own fault great atmosphere 4 stars
Chipotle Mexican Grill,182,I just wanted to give my thanks to a young woman there  Lauren  who helped me and my two small kids out today.  I don t usually frequent chipotle with them  so it was a little chaotic ordering for the three of us and having people accumulate in line behind us  Lauren was patient and extremely helpful and calm  not impatient   she guided the rest of the staff there and made our experience very pleasant.  Thank you Chipotle and Lauren for a job well done 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,183,Chipotle is my favorite fast food. Fast  fresh and heathy. It s also pretty consistent across the country. Very cheap too 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,184,I love the fact that this Chipoltle is so close to my house. It s a solid go-to place when I want something tasty and filling. I usually get the burrito bowl  now with brown rice  whoot    and it s so big that I can have it for lunch AND dinner. So it s not only good  it s economical  
Chipotle Mexican Grill,185,While I like the food  THIS location cannot handle a lunch rush  and has the head banging music turned up WAY TOO LOUD   The employee who we asked about it seemed to care less.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,186,I love Chipotle and have gone to countless locations all over the country. This one is by far the slowest service and dirtiest I ve been in. It s Saturday evening and the line only has two or three people at a time. There s a putrid  mildewy smell lingering that the food aroma can t cover. There are six employees behind the counter  all mingling and doing nothing.  And not one of them checked to see if the tables are cleaned   which they are not. Food crumbs are all over the tables and floors.  This is just not your typical Chipotle at all. And it s too bad since it s in a great convenient location.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,187,Service was terrible  Food  acceptable. Like being served by teenage delinquents in boot camp. Not going back.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,188,I used to go to Chipotle often up north with good experiences but my last visit to this location left me so disappointed I may never go back to any location.  When we walked in my wife had our 10 month old in her arms and out comes the manager who didn t even hold the door for her.  There was a line and I m 2 deep when a slovenly kid loudly and rudely asks us what we want.  I ask for a steak burrito to which he reaches to an empty pan and asks the grill how long it will be   it s gonna be 5 minutes for steak   just give me chicken I reply.  He chucks a small portion of chicken on the plate and the girl next to him rolls her eyes and puts more in because he clearly wasn t trained whatsoever.  Burrito was bland at best.  Attention to detail is completely absent from this location  seems like corporate hubris has ruined this spot and I m sure many others.  Don t waste your time or money.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,189,Chipotle is not like other fast food places.  I know Mexican food probably can t get any better than what you can find in Texas  but Chipotle was a tasty and healthy alternative.  The great thing about Chipotle is the choices you have when you first walk in.  You can choose to have a burrito  taco  burrito bowl  etc.  I ordered the burrito bowl with chicken  brown rice  pinto beans and veggies.  It was excellent.  The chicken was excellent  the brown rice was seasoned perfectly and the salsa was tasty.  It was quick  filling and tasty.  I would recommend this to anyone.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,190,Food was great  but I was expecting a better taste. I prefer Qdoba on taste  but I enjoy Chipotle s organic approach to Tex Mex cuisine.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,191,My hat is off to the manager and staff of this restaurant.  I just stopped by to grab a burrito for lunch - place was PACKED - the line was at least 20 people long.  First thing I noticed was how cheerful the staff seemed - even though they were absolutely slammed.  As I approached the counter  I noticed the front people were smiling  laughing with customers  engaging and friendly - absolutely NOT what you normally encounter at  fast-food  places.  Every single staff member  including the people back in the kitchen cutting meat and cleaning  was cheerful  happy  at least outwardly  and welcoming - I honestly will go back there again JUST for that  but the food was absolutely AWESOME as well - I got a super tasty carnitas  pork  burrito with black beans  salsa and corn - couldn t have been better  and with a side of chips and salsa it was still well under  10.   Well done  Chipotle - you ll be seeing me again    
Chipotle Mexican Grill,192,This place was everything a lady on the go could ask for. Clean  fast  moderately cheap  with a no fuss attitude. I ordered the catbirds bowl and shared some chips with a gal pal. The pork was tender and lean with minimal fat which surprised me  but the guacamole was nothing special   I m sure it was a bagged product considering Chipotle is a franchise . All in all not bad  a step up from a Taco Bell and below La Fonda San Miguel.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,193,I have tried this place for lunch many times because it is close to my work. I regret it everytime. They have no salsa that is mild enough for me. All of there meat is spicy. Maybe I m weak but shouldn t you have something for everyone.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,194,Okay we all love Chipotle. I love Chipotle. But this is honestly the worst Chipotle I have ever been to. I have been here time and time again over a year because it is the closest one to my home. The only reason I keep going back is because well  it s Chipotle. It s easy  it s fast  and it s healthy-ish. What makes this Chipotle so bad is I guess the management  the employees have changed some but the problem keeps happening. The portions are small  they are continuously out of ingredients  and about every other time I get home and half of my order isn t even in my bag. I understand that things happen  but these things honestly happen every time I m in there. Not to mention the employees always seem to be entertained with something else. We can all have fun at work but when you aren t making my dish correct that s a problem. My boyfriend got gift a coupon to the Chipotle in South Park Meadows and wow  what a difference. It even just felt cleaner. The portions were normal Chipotle sized  the employees were paying attention to me so a long line didn t take long to run through and when I got home everything was in my bag. It was crazy how much better of a Chipotle experience there could be. We went one more time and it was the same outcome. Great service  I went back to the Brodie and 290 Chipotle tonight  they didn t put my guacamole in my bag that I watched them make and ring me up for. I m done. Never going back. I will be making the drive to South Park Meadows from now on.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,195,I recently stopped in to have a mexican style lunch. Ordered my food  paid  and sat down to eat. While i was unwrapping my burrito i noticed there was a strand of hair in the aluminum foil. So i went back to the counter and no questions asked they remade the burrito. Awesome food and great service just need to be cleaner 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,196,My favorite fast food restaurant  At times the quantity varies  per the person   other than that no complaints.
Mi Lindo Jalisco,1,Excellent breakfast tacos Freshest  tastiest pico de gallo I ve had in a restaurant  Borrego tacos were fantastic  Homemade corn tortillas
Mi Lindo Jalisco,2,Stopped in for lunch today and was surprised to find this place as close to where I  live. I ve probably seen it or driven by a million times without considering stopping. The restaurant is nothing special  probably was an old fast food restaurant from years ago  seating is plenty and it was clean staff were definitely friendly and helpful with what I wanted to order on the menu. I chose the Jalisco cheese enchiladas with beef  the server suggested fajita meat which is what I ultimately ended up having. The fajita meat wasn t traditional like you see it a lot of other places  it seemed to be diced up and then grilled with some crunchiness in the enchilada  Still I thought it was pretty good. The rice and beans were good  very traditional  but I liked them. All in all this was a lot of food  enough for me to take half of it home  not sure if I would have it again because of the heat of meat being diced and a little bit crunchy  but I might. I would definitely want to come back and try some other things on the menu. The prices are definitely good for your wallet.
Mi Lindo Jalisco,3,Hidden gem. Indistinguishable from any other little Mexican joint you see around Austin. But believe me you will regret passing it up   Very generous portions of delicious  authentic MEXICAN food   My wife got the 4  mini  tacos which were overstuffed with cooked to order asada  grilled onions  amp  cilantro. I got a pastor taco which was as good as I have ever had   We ll be back for sure.
Tellus Joe,1,Their own space has finally opened so I stopped by yesterday for breakfast. I was really underwhelmed and didn t think  14 for one taco and small chai was delivered upon with quality or creativity.   The  5.50 taco was simply a corn tortilla with potatoes and a tiny bit of vegan eggs. No seasoning  no flavor  no texture - an average basic taco.   The chai was also simply average.   The person at the counter pre-selected 20  tip for my takeout order. I am okay with the price if I m getting something delicious  fresh or creative for it. None of those boxes could be checked here.
Tellus Joe,2,I really wanted to like this place more than I did. The vibe was nice and I love The Beer Plant.  We went at night for their  Oaxacan  food. Look  it s probably not fair to bring a group of 8 latinos to this place  but the food had nothing to do with Oaxaca. It reminded me of something akin to Arlo s in that it had a bit of fast-food vegan food taste going for it... except everything was 20-30ish dollars...  The highlights were the cocktails  the frozen black one was  great    and the Aguachile  which actually tasted close to a fish based one-- impressive .  That said  the rest of the food was either bland or somewhat strange in flavor that it just really didn t do it for any of us.   To quote my friend   the tlayuda reminded me of food my mom cooked when she didn t feel like cooking   I m hoping these are just growing pains and I ll try it again in a few months  because it _could_ be a good addition to the vegan scene.
Tellus Joe,3,We had great service.  I loved the atmosphere...  our cocktail was delicious.    The food was extremely underwhelming.  I love Beer Plant  so I was looking forward to this place...  but it was rough...  I ordered a tlayuda  and it was possibly the saddest meal I have ever been served.  It was a beet tlayuda  smothered in a such a thick layer of black beans  that that is the only thing you could taste...  it was sprinkled with a couple pieces of unseasoned flavorless zucchini  that really didn t add anything  and drizzled with a  salsa macha   which was more like infused oil.  This place was such a dissapointment.
Tellus Joe,4,A little hard to find  but is clearly listed  It s a sign right next to Beerplant on the door. The inside is a little bare but  it s a very chic minimalist vibe going on. The girl at the counter was very nice. I came pretty early on a Sunday and there was nobody in there  which is a rare sight for coffee shops in Austin. It s in a neighborhood so might get busier later on the weekdays.   I ordered the coconut mint cold brew and it was totally delicious. It has peppermint and coconut flavor which I never thought would go together so well. It was strong so beware you might get heartburn    I also ordered a breakfast sandwich which I then realized after the fact that this place is a vegan spot. The sandwich was really good and I couldn t tell it was fake meat at all.   Overall  I would return 
Tellus Joe,5,The shop s exterior was pretty nondescript  but the interior nice enough and of the standard gentrified-Austin variety and felt vaguely...Californian. Did not have high hopes for the breakfast tacos  but they were actually very good  Not greasy at all and salsa green sauce are available on the side  so I was pleased. The tacos do come a lot smaller if you opt for corn tortillas instead  and the  migas  on the menu are actually just...eggs  or whatever vegan replacement they use -- didn t taste like JUST egg to me  but I could be wrong  with some green onion and everything bagel seasoning sprinkled on them.
Tellus Joe,6,I m going to have to disagree with some folks here and say that I liked the simple atmosphere. It s peaceful. And if you are looking for a regular breakfast tacos   don t stop here because my taco was different and incredible tasty. The food is prepared at the vegan place next door.  I was feeling adventurous one day and went for a house specialty. The Trailblazer has avocado  migas  pickled celery  cabbage and buffalo sauce. I thought it was a fair price for something unique and delicious.  I looked forward to my second visit and the taco did not disappoint. No complaints about my mocha or americano.  Also  bonus points for plenty of free parking and no traffic.
Tellus Joe,7,The evening food was super delicious  And the cocktails too  It s a cute  small place with Mexican inspired vegan food that is just off the chain. We had the fish tacos  tlayuda  a gin taco and chocolate mousse. Loved everything and had a nice server as well 
Tellus Joe,8,Walked in. Waited and waited while the barista talked to her coworker. Finally was told she will get with us in a second only to keep ignoring us. Beer plant is great this place sucks.
Tellus Joe,9,this place is so incredibly mediocre  it frustrates me. If the food was reasonably priced  I d be less so  but everything here is stupidly expensive. Today I payed  7 for a dirty chai tea latte that tasted more like water than chai spice or espresso. I got a COVID test to see if it was me or the latte  and it was the latte. There s also a taco with ranch on it  I m sorry  but that is WRONG. You can t wrap salad dressing in a tortilla  call it Mexican breakfast cuisine  and then peddle it to me for  6. I suppose Tellus Joe dares to dream. I will just dare to take my money elsewhere
Tellus Joe,10,The decor and customer service is good but  6 breakfast tacos  Come on man  For that price they should be two tacos in one.  The taste was average which in a city that claims to be Taco city you need to up your game. But maybe just maybe they only want a certain demographic as their patrons. If your looking for a breakfast taco that s worth is weight try another option.
Taqueria Olivas,1,One of the better taco trucks I ve found in Austin.  Nondescript truck with yummy tacos.  Great choice for a snack after drinking at Bender Bar right down the block.    I ve had the Pastor  Fajita  Carnitas  Barbacoa  nothing disappointing.  Favorites so far are the Carnitas and one with beef and chorizo whose name escapes me.  If you like tacos al pastor  these are pretty good for Austin.
Taqueria Olivas,2,Mexican mobile taquerias have been around long before airstream cafes were even a bleep on the Austin map.  These underrated  or non-rated  spots don t get enough attention because they don t have retro signage  Twitter accounts  or even a name sometimes.    This particular taco place is quite nondescript - it s pained red and white  and it simply says  Taqueria  on the sign.  There is  however  a flashing strobe light  and that s what first caught our attention.  We only tried the beef fajita tacos  but let me tell you - I don t think I ve ever fallen in love with a taco  and I did with this one. Amor   Tender and juicy beef  perfectly grilled onions and green peppers  plenty of cilantro  and tortillas with just the right flexibility and flavor.  When were were done with our late-night snack  I inquired about the name of the taco trailer  and the woman informed me they were named Taqueria Olivas. She was super nice and asked if we liked our tacos. We ll be back for more   p.s. I had been suffering from a stomach bug  and after this taco  I actually felt better.
Taqueria Olivas,3,This stand has some of the best tacos in Austin.  carnitas- some of the best i have ever had.  chorizo- top quality  not floating in grease.
Taqueria Olivas,4,Hands down the best tacos in austin. Its a taco stand  and their open very late. Perfect on so many levels. I cant even begin to discribe how scrumptious these things are. They are little nuggets sent from above  and its every time I go. Cheap  delicious  late night  south austin  damn.. I think Im gonna go get one right now. You gotta check it out 
Taqueria Olivas,5,would have liked to try the tacos  but the horrible customer service got in the way... ordered with friend late probably around two. i wasn t paying attention  cook put bag on counter  friend picked up bag. Only two tacos in bag as we come to find out  hey we ordered 4...go back to taco stand to get other two tacos...cook insistant that he made and gave us tacos even tho we did not have them  insisted that someone else stole them and it was not his problem that we left them here  even tho we ordered together and had only two tacos in bag...keep in mind we tipped as well...cook offered to make me two more tacos for 2.00  even tho i just wanted my origanal two i paid 3.50 for...then threatened to call police when i insisted on my money back or my tacos...bad experience
Taqueria Mi Zacazonapan,1,The food here was outstanding  My mother  amp  grandmother  both from Mexico City  cook authenticity  so I m a little spoiled on taqueria foods. I felt like Vivi  the lady that took the order  went the extra mile and gave me a sample taco of her special. It was delicious barbacoa with a Consume WOW   I felt like I had just traveled to my grandparent s house. The food was outstanding    Note   There were two Taqueria trucks side-by-side  and I took food from each to sample. I have to say the same here at Mi Zacazonapan is outstanding    There is another truck next door. The  the truck was named Yucat n  and the breakfast taco was fair and gave you a lot. I ordered potato  egg cheese  and beans. It had so many potatoes  and it tasted like I was eating a potato burrito.   Thank you  Vivi  Emy  amp  Gaby  for the great food.
Taqueria Mi Zacazonapan,2,Delicious tacos   Stopped by to try different trucks at the Sunoco and decided to give Taqueria mi Zacazonapan a go  since I ve had the Taqueria los Regios before. Wanted to pick a truck with lengua tacos  and Zacazonapan delivered with the taste  I ordered the barbacoa  lengua and al pastor on flour tortillas and cilantro onions. Squeeze a little lime and sprinkle a pinch of salt  and all the variety of their salsas make the tacos  So yummy  Barbacoa was tender and the best bite. I ve got to go back and try the other kinds of tacos 
Taqueria Mi Zacazonapan,3,Breakfast tacos   2.25 for two ingredients  35 cents for additional ingredient.  We had two bacon egg  1 cactus egg  1 potato egg.  All of the tacos were very reasonable size and filled appropriately  not too much or too little.  This truck is located at the gas station next to the soccer stadium with about 7 other trucks.  Parking can be slightly challenging with all of the food trucks and gas pumps in use  Would definitely do again  the tacos were really good. Note  the red sauce was hot but the verde sauce was like lava. Watch out 
Calle Taqueria,1,You have to try the Beef Fajita Bowl  Something this healthful rarely tastes so good  It starts with a broccoli and cabbage slaw base  topped with meat  cheese  corn  guacamole  pepitas  pico  radish slices and some fresh limes to juice. Some sort of creamy dressing comes on the side  but I didn t think it needed it  because the guac served as dressing enough. You can customize it more to fit your tastes and diet. I don t normally like broccoli and cabbage slaw  but everything else was so flavorful that I didn t notice the tastes I usually dislike from those vegetables. Now I m going to have a hard time not ordering one of these each time I go grocery shopping 
Calle Taqueria,2,Everything tasted good but some of the textures were weird  like I thought the broccoli greens were not the best base for a salad bowl and the queso was runny.
Calle Taqueria,3,My husband and I ordered a side of chips. We had also ordered brisket at Texas BBQ place right next door to make brisket nachos. The chips come with queso but we were able to sub for guacamole. The worker was nice and helpful but even added a small side of pico de Gallo to our order. Overall the chips were solid. The guacamole was good but it was hard to scoop with the chips as they kept breaking. My husband thinks the guacamole was sitting in the fridge too long and wasn t closer to room temperature.
Calle Taqueria,4,My guy and I shared an order of Pastor tacos  and another of Carnitas Quesadillas. Both were very tasty  and very filling even without sides.  The pastor tacos were unexpectedly spicy. It was good  but didn t have the balance of heat and sweet that I find in the best pastor. In my taco  I found only one discernible bit of pineapple  and wanted a little more   Red and green salsa came with the tacos. I m used to getting one mild and one hot sauce  but I found both really hot. I admit I m a wimp in this area  though.  The quesadillas were deliciously greasy and overstuffed with yummy carnitas  a generous serving with pico de Gallo and a lime wedge on the side.  At  8 an entree  this place isn t  quite  as overpriced as the other HEB Main Streat options  but in a town full of 2-3  tacos and full Mexican meals for 8-10   in sit-down restaurants where in non pandemic times you can feast on chips  amp  salsa   this wouldn t be a high priority taco destination for a value-hound like me.
Calle Taqueria,5,Meh.  They have tacos  tortas and bowls.  They have four kinds of protein  one of which is a vegan Impossible Picadillo.  I had a pastor torta and street corn.  The street corn was forgetable.  The torta had a lot of different stuff on it and a strong spicy salsa.  You can get better tortas in food trucks all over Austin ...  But this was not terrible.  The draw for many people might be the Impossible Picadillo.  There are other vegan Mexican places out there ... but I am not sure they would be better than Calle Taqueria.  A lot of those vegan trucks are pretty weak.  If I was positively absolutely having lunch at Mueller HEB  I would think about the duck fat fried chicken place.  But then HEB premade salads are pretty good.  I would probably forget about the food stands  get a ready-to-eat salad  and have that and a drink out on the patio.
Calle Taqueria,6,For an inside-HEB little  affordable restaurant  I truly feel like Calle Taqueria is great. We got 2 bowls  a trompo and an impossible picadillo on broccoli slaw. We thought these were tasty and enjoyed the guacamole  pico  and corn that came with it. We also got the side of beets and pepita. However  menu does not say it comes with a type of spread cheese. I LOVED the combination of whatever the spread was mixed with the beets and pepitas. I had low expectations but would definitely go again   We did not try the tacos or anything else  but they advertise as having homemade corn and flour tortillas. We look forward to trying them soon.
Taco Bell,1,I am not one to usually complain about fast food restaurants because I do get that society typically treats them lower than they deserve. Also I understand that they have a lot going on and some people just suck to deal with. With that in mind  this location has given me multiple incidents or poor behavior.   This current trip was at 11 45 pm on 9 10 2015. Now  I understand that they close at 12 I get this  but  I work late and do not get off until 11 and this location is close to my house. I pulled up to the drive-thru and am greeted accordingly. As I begin to give my order I can hear a male voice yelling in the background  no  no you can t have it  and laughing every time I asked for something. It was hard to even hear the guy I was speaking with because of this person.   On top of that  they were out of everything I wanted. Chicken  beef  beans and chulupas  I do get that it was the end of the night  but business s have scheduled hours for a reason and as a food establishment you should be able to provide your  food  inside those hours.   They were not polite   I get it last customers before you close  I m sorry I was hungry I just got off work. I didn t want to but  my stomach overruled my decision to just go home. I finally just told them never mind and left. This is just one of many occasions that they have not got my order correct or they were just completely incompetent.
Taco Bell,2,See all the other comments. This place is always out of everything  meaning the garbage service I get every time I come here starts from the top. Today s episode started when I went to get breakfast at 9 45 AM. They said they were only serving lunch. I asked when breakfast ended and they told me 11. So I confirmed they were not serving breakfast and they said  that s what I just said.   I know fast food isn t fine dining  but this location has the worst  most rude employees I ve even seen. And this has been their standard for years.
Taco Bell,3,If I could give 0 stars I would. Not only was my order incorrect  the guy at the window was super rude.
Taco Bell,4,Terrible service. Have placed multiple orders through Uber eats and door dash. Every single time parts of my order are missing  details in the order are missed. Absolutely ridiculous  this place needs some detail oriented employees.   This is just one example of the terrible execution on their end  this is a dorito taco in the picture down below. What a joke. Thanks for the taco shell guys.
Taco Bell,5,This location sucks. Don t go here. They will mess up your order time and time again and not help you order a simple black bean quesarito unless you order it on the app that never works  I need someone to explain to me how this makes sense..  we can make it for you if you ordered it on an app that doesn t work but we can t make it happen if you drive up to the window because they discontinued the button  that s some bull. They just made me one last week.... Get it together Taco Bell. You have just lost business because of a simple quesarito. Way to go.   Sincerely the pissed off pregnant woman
Taco Bell,6,A shame the employees can t do their job    Didn t  Bsbdbdjdjdjdjdj bend rhe rn end r. End
Taco Bell,7,Drove here to pick up an online order I d placed at 12 30  because they are open til 1.  I got there at 12 40 and no one was responding. I knocked on the window and said I was there to pick up my order and they said they were closed and that they closed at midnight. 1AM is literally plastered all over the building  on the drive thru  in the app  and here on yelp.
Taco Bell,8,I haven t had Taco Bell in like two years or so. Finally decided it s time again lol . The chicken quesadilla wasn t even sliced   barely grilled and the inside wasn t warm or melty. The Crunchwrap was super flat with almost nothing but the lettuce . Chalupa was ok but super poor compared to ones I ve had in other locations. They forgot to include one of the burritos we ordered so that was a waste of money. The entire order was basically a whole bunch of mostly empty tortillas. I will never be back here again.
Taco Bell,9,okay i have never ever not liked taco bell in my entire life but last night i had the chicken quesadilla from this taco bell and my food tasted like it had chemicals or literally butane in it or something. i had multiple other friends order the same night from this same taco bell and they all said the same thing. three different parties. just beware bc i ve never had this happen before and it was awful.
Taco Bell,10,Once again this location sucks. Couple days ago I came by and they could only accept cash. I came tonight at around midnight and was told the fryer was down  there is no nacho cheese  and several other things meals that were not available  including both meals that my boyfriend and I wanted to order.   Also  get yourself unlisted from favor door dash if you re not going to allow pickups. Twice I have tried to order bc it shows as available but nope. They actually don t do it.   What the hell. Either be a functional restaurant or close.
Taco Bell,11,If the place is even open during the hours it s supposed to  guarantee they will make a mistake on your order and guarantee they will be rude to you over the mic  interrupt you while you re taking and make you feel stupid for even choosing to go to Taco Bell. Shut this place down and fire everyone who works here. Go to McDonald s next door instead.
Taco Bell,12,Both soft potato tacos we got had like hard scraps. My crunchwrap had something super hard which grossed me out bc I have sensory issues and I had to spit it all out. All of their tables were dirty and they forgot 2 of our items and we had to ask for them. Wish I could leave a 0
Taco Bell,13,This Taco Bell leaves a lot to be desired when it comes to even giving you what you ordered. Missing products and even when I got the right thing  it s got 7 soggy fries filling the box by 1 3. Unfortunate because it s in my area but I m not sure I ll be going back. By the way  either figure out that Baja blast zero supply situation or take it off your menu. Been months of it out.
Taco Bell,14,Please fire the employees that work at night  They are unprofessional and disrespectful. They go outside and park their cars sideways in the parking spots and smoke and turn their music loud like they are at a club. Then when people pull up to order food they are drag ass inside smelling of smoke. The short one about 5 5 is the biggest pos ever. He is so arrogant and cocky and he sags he s pants so his underwear are exposed to everyone. I know a lot about this location bc I work door dash and I ve seen him get in a fight with a customer before bc the order was taking to long. It was taking to long bc none of the employees care they are all worthless it s almost criminal. I ve never seen anything like this. I don t even like doing orders from here bc I know half the time the order will be missing something and then I get a bad review. Sometimes I fantasize about beating the shit out of the midget manager bc he needs a reality check.
Taco Bell,15,Worst wait  service  and management I ve ever had to deal with  They lie and say there s no button on their menu and you have to order it online  ok I did and it s not available online. So I go in and order it and they refused to make it  they can t go out of their way to accommodate guests they just flat out refuse and made my pregnant wife very upset. I m done with your long bs waits and your crummy service  Just a P.S. they have the button the GM said so and said to inform the team that they can make it. That just shows flat out crummy customer service 
Taco Bell,16,Y all need to fix your closing time if you re going to close an HOUR early. I drove about 25 min only to get told they are closing. No explanation or anything. Very rude. If I could give ZERO stars  I would. Also says they re open on doordash  fix that too.
Taco Bell,17,They never  ever get the order right for me. Double meat chicken quesdailla wasn t. Just bad.
Taco Bell,18,Ginger dude holding it down solo. Mad respect. Very nice and helpful staff. Management needs to help him out.
Taco Bell,19,This is my third strike here. I don t even have to say much the picture says it all. My orders are never right. Staff is always talking laughing and this is how my food comes out
Taco Bell,20,So I already hate Taco Bell and this is exactly why... Taco Bell never takes pride in their service nor the quality of the frozen food they serve as I used to work there in my high school days so I know everything comes in a bag and is just heated over hot water... that s exactly how it tastes too... disgusting.... This one burrito was all they had to make and I asked for extra sauce and cheese... I had NONE OF THAT... just what you see is what I got... a clump of old beans that I mashed out with no sauce and NO CHEESE EITHER... what in the heck     These people have screens with orders and they don t bother to make sure you get what you ask for... the order is right there... Taco Bell needs to close.... The food is just horrible and has always been horrible... why did I go  In hopes something has changed but only to find it s still the same where staff just don t pay attention and BAD FOOD    Never AGAIN... had to add my own got darn cheese   
Taco Bell,21,So I went to Taco Bell ordered a 12-pack of tacos six crunchy 6 soft with an extra chalupa got home the chalupa was missing called down there they said they would compensate me if I would return so I did but before I left I took pictures of the tacos crunchy that they had given us in the original order all were broken so when I got up there they gave me my bag with two chalupas and a cinnamon twist which was compensation for the first order I showed the manager the pictures of the crunchy tacos gave her the option of either refunding my money or remaking the entire order noticed that there were cars behind me didn t want to tie up there drive-thru being Clyde pull around to the front door talking to my wife on speakerphone the manager came out brought me six crunchy tacos which is half of the original order not including the chalupa I mentioned this to manager on duty basically was told to go f myself ask to have her first name so that when I called the corporate office to make a formal complaint she could be tied to the incident she refused to give me her first name told me to f off so when I called the corporate office to make a complaint I was told that I would receive a phone call in 24 to 48 hours which did not happen so I called back patiently I was told that the situation escalated whether that happened or not don t know call back again because still nobody had contacted me I was told that the situation would be escalated once again which it wasn t this is going on almost a week now called this afternoon was told that a manager or somebody in position would call me within 30 minutes never received a phone call so I called back when their call center Representatives tried to buy me off with for  5 gift cards which is not rectifying the situation I then further demanded to hear from somebody in management at that location or i e corporate office still never heard anything back finally get a phone call back from the manager at the location basically had the I don t care attitude didn t try to rectify the situation explained everything in full to that person basically was still told with an attitude and tone of voice don t really care so yeah I m writing this review I will never be returning to that location I am no longer ever paying paying for Taco Bell at any location I refuse to go there
Taco Bell,22,Wow  What an experience that I ve had at this particular Taco Bell. So I think we can all agree  it would outlandish to expect great service from any Taco Bell. I ve never been at a Taco Bell where I was wowed by great customer service  a clean restaurant or having my food come out good or the way I ordered it. However  this particular Taco Bell... WOW   So I placed an order through the app  because it s save not only me time but the employees when they can just look up the order without having to type and change everything. I go through the drive thru  get my food and pull into the parking spot because very rarely is my order correct. To no surprise to me  the order wasn t made correctly. It was close  the Gordita Crunch was made with the wrong shell which is an easy mistake but my Potato Griller was made outrageously small. I almost laughed in my car when I showed my friend it  because there s no way someone can think this is normal.  So I went inside  where a gentleman from the front desk immediately asked  Was there something wrong with your order   I said yes  took out the two particular items in question  explaining that my Gordita Crunch was supposed to be made with the Doritos Nacho Cheese shell. I then explained that the Potato Griller was laughably small. I took it out of the wrapper to show that it s literally the length of my fingers and very thin. The manager comes over to look  and informed me that the Potato Griller was made correctly and that is the size it s supposed to be.  I just smiled and said that s fine. I just figured I would take a picture of the burrito and ask the public if they think this is acceptable. I also was going to send the picture to Taco Bell and see what they think. I ll post the pictures to my review.  Here s my version of expectations vs reality 
Taco Bell,23,This location always skimps on the fillings. I m not sure if they think lettuce and tomato are that expensive  but I ve paid extra for  extra  lettuce and tomato and still received less than standard.  The last time I went they managed to mess up every item that we ordered  including giving us some of the wrong items. The staff was rude and didn t greet us at the window or even make eye contact. 0 10  would not recommend and will not be back.
Taco Bell,24,I went inside the restaurant to pick up the order  I didn t know It was open for drive-through only  here it was a surprise  I can t believe how dirty it is
Taco Bell,25,I have a new theory  there is a black hole of suck centered on the 620 2222 intersection where the majority of places fall into the meh-awful zone.  My other reviews will bear this out  as the farther they are from this intersection the better things tend to get.  This Taco Bell falls on the  awful  side of the zone.  Like the other places in the area  it s understaffed and the staff that does bother to show up seems bummed out.  I ve had bean burritos that were watery  and quesadillas which have been rimmed with burned cheese.  Everything else is as dispirited tasting as the staff looks.  This place gets a 1 on the  CTJ Scale  as noted below.  5 out of 5 stars  Come-to-Jesus good. Would be OK passing on after finishing a plate here. 4 out of 5 stars  Come-to-Mary good. Would be OK being seen eating here by Mother Mary. 3 out of 5 stars  Come-to-Joseph good. Would be OK having a beer here with Jesus  Dad. 2 out of 5 stars  Come-to-the-Apostles good. Meh. Wouldn t have my last supper here. 1 out of 5 stars  Come-to-Nobody good. I wouldn t have my penultimate supper here  either.
Taco Bell,26,I love this place my food is always made very well and I get my order very good and some people hate Taco Bell but I m in love with Taco Bell .  There is very good service there there was this lady who complimented me and she made me very happy because it was the day my uncle died and ever since that day Taco Bell has been my to-go place. Thanks you Taco Bell for being there and making the best place in Texas for me that my be the place I start my career because I m still in school . I tell my mom to take me there when I get money because I love Taco Bell and when I go out with my friends we always end up going to Taco Bell because of me . So thank you Taco Bell for everything
Taco Bell,27,Order placed  four crunchy tacos with sour cream added and a supreme beef burrito. They were out of sauce. Received three crunchy tacos no sour cream and a bean burrito. Just lazy  mess up   who cares  teenage bull shit. Go to Whataburger after the bar.  This place can t find their own ass.   CB
Taco Bell,28,Ordered online  had my relative pick up the order.  Got home  NO Nacho s.  Called and they said Oh yeah  we left that out of your order.  Asked for refund and was told that was not possible.  CAll Tacala.  WTF   Ridiculous.  Rip.  No one cares anymore.  Pitiful.  Was told come back and we will make the order.  Duh.  Only live 10 miles away.  1 way.  Really.
Taco Bell,29,This was a great place until tonight. The food tasted like rotten fish  there was no lettuce in it like usual  and they just threw in a cheese empanada in there after the girl at the drive thru told them I was vegan. Really disgusting food tonight. Also a guy answered the phone and lied about being the manager. I ve never had a problem at any Taco Bell until tonight. Really shocking...  esp.after years of having gone to Taco Bell....
Taco Bell,30,Idk why I keep giving this place a chance  I guess it s due to my kids and myself being hungry and this is our only option since I didn t have my car today. But they get something wrong every time and barely put meat in the tacos. I will stop spending my money here.
Taco Bell,31,The management at this Taco Bell needs to go. Do not eat here. Sarah was completely rude and uninterested in needs of the customer. A new employee  Emilio  was the only person who stepped up to help assist. Side Note   This was a Thursday morning at 11 30 AM. There were no other patrons in the restaurant and it was slow.  We placed an office order with 30  tacos burritos bowls etc. Nothing was labeled to determine what was chicken  which had no tomato  which were vegetarian  continued on. When the manager was asked to help identify the food  she turned her back and didn t communicate with me at all. She stated they were wrapped with what they were. However  the wrapping listed 4 or more types of food the taco could have been and nothing was circled or indicating which order it was. I asked for the District Manager s name and number. They gave me Mike s name and a number where I was to leave a VM.  We all know what that means  i ll never get a call back.   After picking through every taco to make sure the order was correct  only to discover items missing. I left feeling extremely frustrated for wasting 15 minutes there  tacos became soggy and no hot sauce or silverware or napkins included.  I ve worked in customer service a long time and there s a reason places like Chik-Fil-A are thriving.
Taco Bell,32,Wow. Taco Bell out of meat and anything resembling something to eat. They told us to come back in 20 minutes if we wanted to be served. Not the optimal outcome especially with a car full of kids that were hoping for the Bell. We took our business elsewhere.
Taco Bell,33,This place has great customer service    we made a mistake in ordering and they were so kind    Mike and Michael were amazing
Taco Bell,34,This is fast food I don t expect greatness but I do expect my order. If you have children check your orders. Over the last couple of years I have gone here off and on  the kids really love it. Unfortunately the food is different every visit. Sometimes it s gross and runny and unrecognizable and sometimes it s fine. I can t prove it was taco bell but sometimes i get a little sick after eating here.  Sometimes a Mexican pizza looks like some one relieved themselves on  a tostada shell and sometimes it looks like a Mexican pizza. The quality of the food is hit or miss without a doubt. How you can screw up beans from a can is beyond me.  I pay extra every time for sour cream  but you could flip a coin on whether or not I m going to get it. I don t like getting ripped off but when you short me on orders for the kids and now I ve got upset kids because someone is missing a couple of tacos  then ripping me off becomes a big problem. Will I still go  Yes  begrudgingly but I will check each and every item  and I will go in...no more drive through because you guys have consistently proven you can t be trusted.   I ve lived for quite a while with taco bells close to my places more than once and I have to say this is the worst taco bell ever. Avoid it and steer the kids elsewhere if you can help it or be diligent and check every thing in your order. If it looks like diarrhea chances are that s how its coming out too.
Taco Bell,35,Most disappointing Taco Bell EVER  Walked in at 8 pm and was promptly informed that the location was  out of food.  What does that even mean  They said that the morning shift did not prep for them  but this is FAST food for a reason. Shouldn t it be fast to prepare 
Taco Bell,36,I give two stars for the food  the service has gone to crap. The last 6 months has been a steady drop in service and now the wait times are 20 minutes when there is an empty parking lot and 3 cars in front  tired of hearing that  employees just walked off the job  forgetting that they ve been saying that for a couple of months due to the delays.  Management has it all wrong  the people on day shift are as slow as slugs  night shift just is never there.  When will this one go the way of Taco Cabana - bad staff eliminates the customer base. Call it a day and end it.
Taco Bell,37,WORST TACO BELL EVER. We went in for a remake because our entire order was incorrect the night before and we contacted the store and was told by Micheal come in to have our order corrected or refunded. Dalia was extremely rude to use for the moment we said we were there for a refund remake. She explained that the notes only had 2 items incorrect and we stated well if it is too much to remake we would take a refund in which she kept saying  I will not give you a refund   which makes so sense as I AM THE CUSTOMER. If i did not want the food remade i should absolutely have the option to have my money back. If she simply looked at the ticket and spoke to us like adults rather than some hoodlums that were trying to get free food we would have happily explained our drinks and ONE item from the night before was correct. Instead she had a horrible attitude the entire time made us feel as though we were in the wrong for not only wanting the items we already called about but for also saying we would take a refund. I could easily tell she was judging us based off the color of our skin  I don t know about her but  20 of Taco bell isn t breaking my bank and we literally only wanted our food. She made us feel uncomfortable  unwelcome and honestly uneasy the entire time.
Taco Bell,38,The worst Taco Bell and should be shut down. They never get my order right  they close earlier than they are supposed to  give me attitude everytime I correct my order and the people that work there don t do their jobs.
Taco Bell,39,I have to admit that Taco Bell is one of my guilty pleasures.... But this particular location is one that I try to stay away from  which is sad because it s the closest one to my house.    I will say that I have had more terrible experiences here than I have good experiences  and really how hard can it be    Let s start off with the fact that there is always something that they are out of for the night. Now I m not talking at 1am after a huge rush of people going home from the bar  I m talking at 9pm on a Friday or Saturday. And these are not ingredients a Taco Bell can survive without. When you are out of ground beef  chicken  beans  and cheese  you might as well shut the place down. My sister and I went 3 times and every time there was something they were out of.   Second  the orders are normally wrong  and if they arnt consider yourself lucky. I once stopped on my way home and did not check the bag because honestly you shouldn t have to. When I got home 15 minutes later I realized half the order was gone. I drove back up there and let them know this was the case they made me my  missing  items. By this time I had learned to check the bag after pulling forward  and immediately noticed that the order was still not completely there. I pulled back around and sat at the window  inside was closed  and finally  after 5 minutes  someone came to the window. I asked for a manager to personally make my last items as I figured they would at least try to make it correctly.  Which brings me to my last point. The staff is rude and incompetent. The manager that I spoke to just asked  Well what do you want me to do about it   I wanted to try and be nice because everyone knows a horror story of someone spitting in food  but at this point I was just irritated. I told him that honestly I just want what I payed  20 for so my family could eat dinner. He gave me the rest of my food and lucky for me  provided me a lovely little flier for a  free  breakfast item. After reading the flier I realize it s just a normal event they were doing to promote the items and that was for everyone. Gee thanks sir.   So it s safe to say I will stay away as best as possible until corporate takes action.... Which I seriously doubt they will since everyone in my family has called multiple times to complain and it still remains just as terrible.
Taco Bell,40,Been coming here for years. I see alot of new faces now. Looks liked they cleaned house. Service has gotten much faster. The quality has stepped up alot. Lunch will always be busy though. Theres an extremely nice staff there now only getting better. The night manager very impressive. Puts a smile to my face every time i come in. Hes a comedian which nakes my visit through drive thru and very fun experience. Im very impressed.
Taco Bell,41,Wife and I went in the drive-thru last night. When we got our order it was evident that it was hastily thrown together and the quality of the food was just awful. Called the manager Michael to make our complaint and he was very kind and assured us we would be taken care of when we went in the following day... Following day comes  we go in expecting either a refund or a new order  and as Michael had promised the night before some coupons. Instead we were greeted with a manager  Dalia  who from the jump was giving us a less than friendly attitude. While my wife spoke to her about the incident it looked like she didn t care. My wife and I are colored  and by the way we were treated it felt like we were profiled  black people trying to get something for free . She kept repeating  I will not be issuing a refund  and each time with more attitude. We weren t asking for anything specific  but we demanded that the situation be remedied for the subpar service we were given the night before. And to be frank Dalia made my wife and I very uncomfortable and upset.  Don t go here  we saw a woman trying to go in last night with an order that was wrong  it s evident they have no sense of care or customer service here.
Taco Bell,42,This Taco Bell is the worst  They always have long wait times only Because of their own incompetence. At the drive through they now let people know there is a 25 minute waiting period. At 2 pm on a Wednesday. When they aren t waiting for glaciers to melt before serving you your food  the order you receive is normally INCORRECT and the employees couldn t give a shit. Even for a Taco Bell  the standard is low. In need of new management for sure
Taco Bell,43,This place has gone downhill  hiring rude and lazy workers who could care less. Make sure you check everything you order here because there is a 90  chance it s wrong and overdone underdone. Ordering online is also a joke  they just ignore what your customizations are.
Taco Bell,44,Okay  so I went to this taco bell this morning and I just want to say to anyone reading this JUST GO TO ANOTHER TACO BELL OR TACO RESTAURANT. Customer service was awful  and I will tell my story here   Sunday April 28  9 30 10 30 AM.  I pull up to the drive through and see NOBODY in the parking lot or drive through. I am greeted over the speaker by a woman  and since I have never been to taco bell for breakfast I know  I m lame  I ask her  do you guys have a protein bowl   her answer  no.  That s it  just a blunt  no  and then silence. So I ask  is there a way I could add egg to the power bowl or maybe substitute for something in the power bowl  Her answer  I mean...you can add egg on the side.  After that  silence. I then say to her  there isn t anyone in line behind me  do you mind if I have a second to look at everything   and she doesn t even respond. Typically  I would think a  sure let me know when you re ready  or something along those lines would suffice. But instead  she immediately replaced herself with a different guy. Literally maybe 10 seconds after I asked for a second  I hear a male voice say  what can I get for you today   So at this point  I am feeling rushed and I just order random stuff off the breakfast menu that I didn t even want. I pulled up to the window  gave the young man my money  and then was told to wait at the pit for my food. Seconds before I drove away  I looked through the window and literally saw the lady YELL at this guy  come on  hurry up   First of all  that is NOT how you treat your employees. You do not need to yell at them like they are in a sweat shop. When he came over  I asked him what had happened  Because she didn t even give me a response  but just put him on the headset instead  He then told me that she was  in a bad mood because of stress from the night crew.  I then responded to him with the fact that I too work in a stressful  fast paced environment and have to deal with hundreds of angry customers in my face daily. Just because you are stressed or having a bad day DOES NOT MEAN YOU TAKE IT OUT ON CUSTOMERS. Also  there was NO ONE in the drive through or parking lot  so it s not like there were a bunch of customers inside or out. I wish I knew this lady s name but her attitude was so awful and I promise you I will just go to the taco bell on 620 in Lakeway instead because they are always very kind and hook it up big time for me with the power bowls  Again  I wound up ordering random stuff I didn t really want. I wasted money and time  and I probably should have just driven away. I hope you can hear me Taco Bell at Four Points  because I am very upset with the way I was treated today. What s funny is  I am never that person to go on a tangent like this unless I find it very necessary. I can t believe this chick is a manager. I will leave with this--the young man whose name I didn t get was a tall brown haired white guy with colored eyes I believe. He was very nice and did nothing wrong. Another time  a young lady with long blonde hair  Chelsea I think   was so sweet and got my order right  So my one other time going here was not so bad  but man did this one specific time just ruin it for me.
Taco Bell,45,Just left after being their first customer and the young man that helped me was unbelievably courteous. He advised me of my wait and offered me a drink and even insisted when I refused  Then  he mentioned he threw in an empanada in my bag just for the trouble. Unbelievable customer service  that guy deserves a raise or at least a promotion  Completely satisfying experience 
Taco Bell,46,One out of ten visits my food is made correctly the first time. Constantly having to send most of it back. Then I get eye rolls and attitude. Most of the time I ll arrive when I know there will be few customers and quite a few of these experiences I was the only one ordering. I discussed this with one of the managers and he said they just hired a bunch of new people. They either need to train better or make sure employees can read their screens. This location is one of the worst I ve visited in my life and I love stopping to get their food 
Taco Bell,47,I typically do not walk in and eat at Taco Bell. I usually go through the drive thru.  Today I decided to walk in and I m glad I did. We were greeted by Bryanne. she was so sweet and welcoming. Thumbs up to her   She definitely made my bad day amazing.
Taco Bell,48,HORRIBLE customer service  I like Taco Bell food and that s the only reason I would go here.  They laughed at me when I tried to open the doors after hours and hid under the counter and Bella  the drive through attendant  told me  and I quote  please don t come to Taco Bell again  when we went through the drive through.  Also  who makes someone drive around the building three times for three different orders   It s not fast food when it takes us 20 minutes just to get a couple of burritos in the middle of the night with no business and six workers.  Like I said  Taco Bell food is great  but if I were to give this one a rate 1-10 based on customer service i d give it a solid 1.  If you really love Taco Bell and can deal with crappy people  go here.
Taco Bell,49,Worst service I have ever got. Yea... I know it s a Taco Bell but come on... 23 minutes to get 2 bean burritos inside. On my lunch hour that really is tough. No apologies from anyone working there for waiting  as was everyone else inside this place. Always seemed like Taco Bell was fast in the past when I went. Very disappointed.
Taco Bell,50,They constantly get our order wrong. Regardless of if the order screen is correct  the order is almost always incorrect. This location is pathetic. Don t EVER go there
Taco Bell,51,Consistently the shittiest Taco Bell experience. Can t even make a quesadilla. Won t be going to this Taco Bell anymore.
Taco Bell,52,Literally the worst Taco Bell I ve ever encountered. I was a tried and true Taco Bell lover in college  and since becoming pregnant have been CRAVING a crunch wrap.   All the ingredients were in a small clump on ONE SIDE so my pregnancy dreams of the  meat  covered in  cheese  were dashed as I bit into a taco she ll wrapped in a tortilla. What. The. Hell.   I will NEVER EVER EVER go here again. Complete waste of time. I m actually going to call Taco Bell corporate and ask for an investigation to the fraud.
Taco Bell,53,I m sitting here eating right now and it just hit me...This is by far the friendliest  cleanest  most well kept Taco Bell I ve ever been in in my entire life. Pretty surprised....
Taco Bell,54,I go here because it s the closest one to my home. Tomatoes and sour cream left out of my Taco supreme 10 30 pm and the only person in the drive thru so there should be NO excuse to rush or mess up orders. On top of screwing up a taco supreme they also managed to mess up the nacho cheese chalupa by forgetting the nacho cheese. It s always something every time I come here. Get it together and hire staff that isn t stoned out of their minds.
Taco Bell,55,I wish I could give this location less than a one star. It s the closest location to me so I usually go to it more than often. When I order my food not only does it take forever but most of the toppings are missing. Last time i ordered a cheesy Frito burrito and the only thing that was in it was a tortila  cheese sauce and rice. No meat or fritos. Fuck this taco bell and all the dumbass who work there. Good luck at being successful human beings in life when you forget the Fritos in a friros burrito.
Taco Bell,56,Service at this Taco Bell used to be good  it was polite and fast  the food has always been...well  Taco Bell lol. Now it is garbage. Went by 6-7 weeks ago  was told it will be 20 minutes before I could order because it was only the manager and 1 other person there  went else where. Tried again maybe 4-5 weeks ago  ordered a  3  3 crunchy taco supreme s   asked for no tomatoes  the manager told me that it did not come with tomatoes  only the taco supreme s did... I left. Tried again tonight  Pulled up to any empty drive through lane  employee came over the drive through speaker to tell me that the drive through was closed. Well 3 strikes and you re out. Lost my business for good. I ll go to the Bell up the street at 183  amp  Pecan Park from here on  hopefully that one will have competent employees that show up to work.
Taco Bell,57,Taco Bell food is the same everywhere  so you always know what you re getting.  ...or do you   At least not at the drive-through window at this location    Several times my drive through order was incorrect.   It wasn t like we got someone else s order.   No - they generally got it close but not entirely correct.    Usually a missing or wrong item  but  hey  we once got a bonus burrito.   I don t know why I keep going back there.  I guess I m an optimist.  ...or a gambler
Taco Bell,58,Welp  today was my last day as a customer at this location.  Once again  closed at breakfast.  Inside lights were darkened and when you pull up to the speaker  you get a recording that says they are closed. Between the poor management  continuous 20 minute food waits  out of food  out of ice  and sporadic closures during breakfast hours when they should be open  I ve finally had enough.  It s too bad because it isn t failing because of customers.  It s because the workers and management don t care and are driving business away because of their poor efforts.  If you aren t open to take business  you can t make money for your franchise owner.  I m sure your franchise owner thinks it s because there aren t enough customers to draw business and not because of how poorly run it is.  This area is growing exponentially and fast food restaurants are few and far between and lack in variety  so there are plenty of people to patron this location. Taco Cabana failed in our area due to poor management.  This Taco Bell is on it s way to the same fate it seems.  It s unfortunate.
Taco Bell,59,I went here at about 10pm on Friday night and after placing our order they notified us that they were out of beans. Seriously  more than 80  of their menu requires beans   Needless to say we cancelled our order and needed to find some other options in the food desert that is Lakeway after 9pm.
Taco Bell,60,Slow AF took 30 minutes to get food 2nd person in the drive through line then the guy didn t give us napkins sauce and didn t even ask if we needed any would most definitely avoid if possible...
Taco Bell,61,Piece of advice  don t waist your or money at this location.  Food is half done and the service is really slow - 28 minutes from order to receiving food.  We ate and was on the way out of the restaurant when the guys behind us had finally got their food - 6 regular tacos smh
Taco Bell,62,Out of taco meet at 8 30 on a Saturday night. It s not like they were busy. No customers were in the restaurant when we came in. We stood at the counter for a couple of minutes before someone came out from the office area. There wasn t even anyone in the food prep area. The only reason why they got 2 starts was because the manager came up and corrected the clerk before we paid.
Taco Bell,63,- Gluten Free Menu  Yes - On-line - Size of G Free Menu   limited but at least they are aware  a href   redir url http 3A 2F 2Fwww.yum.com 2F 2Fnutrition 2Fallergen 2Fallergen_tb.asp amp s e692bd3ce4e95f9899c0a0b457b663dc8b10c00515504d923bf048806bc3264f  rel  nofollow  target  _blank  yum.com  nutrition aller   a  - Waiter Aware of the Gluten Free Menu Options  I wouldn t bet on it.  So come prepared. - Food   It is Taco Bell..  What do you expect.  But it is good to see they are thinking about people with food allergens  sensitivities  and intolerances.  So they get an extra star in my book.  They have the following suggestion   Suggestions for Wheat and Gluten Sensitive Individuals  - Tostada  - Chicken Fiesta Taco Salad  order without the shell and without the Red Strips   - Chicken Express Taco Salad  order Chicken instead of Beef   - Zesty Chicken Border Bow l  order without the Zesty Dressing and without the Red Strips   - Southwest Steak Bowl  order without the Creamy Jalapeno Sauce  I am not sure why they say to order without the Creamy Jalapeno Sauce.

Taco Bell,64,This is my favorite Taco Bell  It s really close to my house and I always get great service and my food is always hot. Unfortunately Taco Bell has a reputation for being not very nice and bad with food handling. I ve definitely been to a few of those but I ve never had that experience here. How often do you get fast food service that not only was patient while you decided what to get and then ordered something complicated but also asked how my day was when i got to the window   They seem to have a good time working here too. One time a girl saw me looking at the hiring poster and started telling me why it s worth it to work there. Most fast food places the people look like they hate their life but I haven t seen much of that here. Even when I m not in the area I make the effort to specifically come to this one because I know I can trust them.
Taco Bell,65,We live closest to this location but they repeatedly do not give you all of your order and we don t find out until we get home. I called this time because they actually only gave us one of our two nacho bell grandes  how can you miss that  . We even asked  is that it   and she said  yes  quickly but as to get rid of us asap and move on. Even the nacho dorito taco requested was the fire one instead. Last time.. a burrito supreme.  I spoke to Leslie the manager  we think it was her at the window  and she said she put me down on the list to receive a bell grande and a burrito supreme and something else at no charge for our repeated inconvenience. I then asked her if she d like my actual  name  to put on the list so I can actually  be on it . Ridiculous.  I ll be going out of my way to Parmer or Lake Creek from now on if I even decide on Taco Bell anymore. Not going to worry about going back to get these things. Fix this about this location please 
Hot Tacos,1,Staff were supah dupah friendly and helpful. Food was amazing  I have ordered the vegan cauliflower tacos and it was delicious 
Hot Tacos,2,Ordered combo platter of 2 tacos beef and fish that came with chips and salsa and a Agua frescas watermelon drink. Also ordered the chicken quesadilla.  Service was pretty fast on a not so busy Thursday night.   Tacos were very good. They were deep fried and the the green and orange spicy sauce that came with them were really good.  They have double tortillas like street tacos but these were dep fries and crunchy. Loved bother the fish and beef tacos very tasty. Chips were homemade and very crunchy and went well with the fresh guacamole.   The chicken quesadilla was good but next time I would probably order the El Pastor or beef quesadilla.  This also came with the green and orange sauce.    I would definitely come back and either get the same tacos or maybe try something new. Almost forgot the agua frescas watermelons was really good. Not to sweet but really refreshing.  I would get that again for sure.
Hot Tacos,3,So so excited to have Veracruz All Natural tacos out in LA. The migas taco in a homemade flour tortilla instantly took me back to Austin mornings  I could eat a grilled fish taco all day and especially this one  and the cochinita pibil was so juicy and crunchy in the fried shell. And the salsas   Really great to have this in the Line Hotel parking lot. I can t wait to come back.  You can also preorder for pickup   a href   redir url https 3A 2F 2Forder.dripos.com 2FHot-Tacos- 2B-Line-Hotel amp s 86a8ec8dd6932eb4d8b21b43bd921fc7553aae9ddd9fd3e152a4c22251a9b5b1  rel  nofollow  target  _blank  order.dripos.com Hot-Tac   a 
Hot Tacos,4,Excellent. They open at noon on Sundays. Got the steak taco and pork quesadilla. Taco shell was crispy and flavorful  steak was juicy and tender. Loved the cabbage and toppings. Complemented it very nicely. Quesadilla was a bit sloppy  but so gooey and yummy. Pork had a lot of flavor and it was oozing with cheese. Def stop in while in Austin
Hot Tacos,5,Pretty damn good  I took the advice of other reviewers and they were right  The migas taco is the way to go.  It s delicious.  I would get 2 or 3 if I went again.     I also got the cochinta pibil and it was good as well. Not spicy at all.  The salsas were good.  The spiciness of the medium and hot weren t all that different but the flavor was.  The medium is a green salsa  more fresh and the hot was orange and a touch smokey.  The guacamole was good as well but a little too much lime for me and maybe the avocados could have been a little more ripe.  Love trying new taco places and this didnt disappoint.  Thanks yelpers 
Hot Tacos,6,NOTE  Dined in my car on 12 11 2021  but there are outdoor tables there as well  Valet let me park for a short period of time  but you mileage may vary. My apologies for not taking a photo of the migas tacos - they weren t much to look at after unwrapping them and we devoured them VERY quickly.  LA s official food is tacos and deservingly so. I have never been to a single metropolitan area that contains so many different types of tacos stemming from different cultures  techniques  incorporation of unique ingredients... it s honestly incredible. One area that our wonderful city has been lacking in when it comes to tacos are Texmex-style migas. Yeah  we have HomeState  but that s about it. The one complaint I ll hear from Texans who come to visit are that we don t offer good queso nor good migas.   Enter Hot Tacos  brought to us by one of the most popular migas spots in Austin  Veracruz. Now  I actually haven t been to Veracruz in Austin  so I can t really make a comparison  but perhaps that s even better  as I can craft a review from more of a  blind  experience without expectations.  Starting off with something more familiar  and since it was a cold day   we opted to try out the birria. Honestly  it s comparable to most other birria spots in LA  but the consome is REALLY good. Rich  flavorful  piping hot. If you somehow got your tongue stuck on a pole  this is what you would use to lubricate yourself to get out. That would still hurt like crazy  though... so don t do it    The main attraction awaits you when you order the migas here.  Migas  literally means crumbs  but refers to the use of leftover ingredients like stale tortillas or bread in a dish. Now  these tortillas are freshly made if you order flour  so that s the route we selected. If you want it to be more photo-friendly  you can go for the corn tortillas. Those are dyed with beet juice to give your tortilla a signature pink hue. We opted for bacon in one taco and chorizo in the other. For me  the gold standard in chorizo is over at tire shop taqueria. Second place goes to The Chori-man in San Pedro. I enjoy my chorizo grilled until the outside is crispy and has that smokiness imbued into it. The chorizo here is definitely NOT like that. The bacon  though... the bacon is very well cooked. Crunchy and yet still retains some wonderfully indulgent fattiness to it. Perfectly complements the Monterey Jack cheese  black beans  pico de gallo  scrambled eggs  tortilla chips  and a little bit of avocado. Yes  these tacos are JAM-PACKED and you ll be able to taste each element individually as you devour it.   They re a little pricey  but trust me  that bacon one is 100  worth the price of admission. Unfortunately  it looks like the truck is no longer here but hopefully it comes back soon because despite being surrounded by all sorts of delicious tacos in this city  I feel like we re missing something now that Hot Tacos is gone.
Hot Tacos,7,I love tacos  And Hot Tacos did not disappoint  I had the Migas breakfast tacos and they were bomb  And they had a pink corn tortilla  so cool  J oh also got a watermelon agua Fresca and it was so fresh and delicious. They had some really yummy other flavors also. I ll have to try the pineapple on my next stop and the citrus pork tacos which sounded amazing  Also staff was great and super friendly. Can t wait to go back   
Hot Tacos,8,Run don t walk to Hot Tacos AKA Veracruz All Natural of Austin  Texas.  I am extremely picky on newly opened places that I hit up on opening week.  Veracruz All Natural is a heavy hitter in the Austin food scene so much that they have expanded from their humble trailer.  Mr. Jonathan Gold recommended Veracruz All Natural to me when we were both in Austin for SXSW.  Definitely put Hot Tacos on your radar or  must eat list.   This is a taco that is considered among the best of the best in Austin.   The thing you will want to order is the migas tacos  Texas style.  For some reason they decided to tweak their Texas recipe and add carrots. I tasted it  and it s not as good. I repeat  get the migas tacos  Texas style  on a flour tortilla.  You can park at valet for 15 minutes and take your tacos to go. This area is kinda shady and I had trouble finding a  safe  spot in the neighborhood so you might want to pay for parking at the Line Hotel or find metered parking  if you re lucky .   Normally I would find a local park to eat my pandemic era takeout  but I didn t have the patience to search for a decent and safe park in this neighborhood. I just wanted to eat my food freshly made and hot. You don t want to take these home or the chips in the migas tacos will get soggy.  One bite while I shut my eyes  I imagined myself back in Austin having one of the best bites ever.   The texture. The flavor. This taco is sublime.  They gave me their fresh mango agua fresca to try and it is so so good if you re a mango lover -- do not sleep on this either  To complete the Austinite experience  order the Topo Chico.  Go eat here now before the line gets crazy long once more people hear about these magical Tex-Mex tacos 
Hot Tacos,9,Tried this place after finishing our morning walk with the pup. Got here around noon and got the food to go.   Parking  truck is located inside the line hotel. We just walked in.   Wait  no wait. Food took about 5 mins to come out.   Food  3 5. Just wanted to try it after a walk so I am judging the whole place from its signature taco. I got the migas taco which is their version of the breakfast taco and the medium hot sauce. I ate it at home which is about 5 mins away. By the time I opened it up whole taco was soggy from the beans heat. Flavor was ok  but the salsa overpowers the flavor of the taco so if you try it go easy on the sauce.   Environment  4 5. they got an instagramable set up. Fake grass and bar style tabletops on site is a nice touch.  Service  n a as we got it to go. Wouldn t expect service at any taco truck.   Overall  this place is about average.   7 for a taco seems a bit steep. Competition in the area for tacos is high so you may be more successful trying another place. If you are staying at the Line hotel  this is extremely convenient.
Hot Tacos,10,Missing Texas breakfast tacos  Now  you don t have to miss them any longer.  Opened by the famous chefs behind Veracruz All Natural in Austin is Hot Tacos. All of the lunch tacos are made of well-seasoned meat - from chicken  steak and pork. But  what you really need to come here for are the migas breakfast tacos. They are the perfect blend of chips  avocado  cheese and scrambled eggs.
Hot Tacos,11,We came for the migas taco which was what all the press has been writing about as a great breakfast  read egg filled  taco  however we were more impressed with the cochinita pibil  marinated in orange juice and achiote. This has easily got to be the best tasting cochinita pibil that we ve tried. Usually  for some odd reason  they end up being dry. We ordered both with flour tortillas.  We d easily come back if we were in the area again to try some of the other options.
Hot Tacos,12,If you re in K Town and find yourself hungry for something delicious and Latino  you must stop and try some Hot Tacos by Veracruz.  Their food is the kind that Los Angeles has needed for a long time. I saw them on the KTLA Morning News  and when I found their truck  I headed straight for it       price for  food  Learn their story too   
Hot Tacos,13,Excellent  servings are generous  juicy and ridiculously good  Birria tacos were excellent and the quality of the instruments was great. Excellent temperature and the consume was absolutely wonderful and added so much flavor
Hot Tacos,14,This was a rec from a friend who had been to the Vazquez sisters  Austin restaurant  and holy crap am I glad I listened to him. We had the migas  chicken  and steak tacos and they were PHENOMENAL. Also pretty  so I m attaching a photo   The one less than awesome thing is the location - you re sort of in the driveway of the Line hotel  which is... odd  I m assuming this isn t the permanent location so no dings.
Hot Tacos,15,I live in Koreatown and I finally tried this place. The food is really good and the people working here are nice.    5 sounds expensive for one taco but the tacos here are big and filling. I don t think I d ever want or need more than two.
Hot Tacos,16,I don t feel it s fair to give this place a rating because I couldn t get any food. Valet said I had 10 minutes and if it wasn t ready I had to move my car. The parking situation sucks  How do you run a business when there is no street parking and what they perpetrate is if they have parking and they really don t. Am I going to pay 10 bucks to buy a six dollar taco  most likely the answer is no. The valets were friendly and courteous but the tone was you can t park here for more than 10 minutes. If the kitchen is backed up I am supposed to move my car. I didn t even want to eat it there  just wanted to order to go. I wish them a Lotta luck and hopefully their next place will have a parking situation that s better 
Hot Tacos,17,The chicken taco was dry.  However  the Watermelon Agua Fresca was great   Both overpriced   Disappointed.
Asador,1,This is my favorite taco truck so far in Austin. Located conveniently on Rainey Street if you re downtown. The brisket is not only stellar it s the way they grill the taco shell and the meats  I m not sure what there  process  is but there is def a technique  Highly recommend for the brisket taco lover  The chicken  amp  carnitas are good as well but the brisket
Asador,2,Used to love the food here but had a horrible experience tonight. Had tacos from the Rainey location and mentioned these look a little burned and was told to fuck off by your employees working tonight. Both the man working the cash register and the man working the grill.
Asador,3,There s so many options on this street  and this place...nope. We were given the wrong order  but I ll eat anything so whatever.  I thought the portions were small  and I don t eat much. Prices are insane.  18 for 2 tiny tacos and a soda. There s a strange seasoning on the meat and chips that tastes weird. The meat was tender juicy though so it would probably be good if you re drunk. The queso tasted exactly like beer cheese soup. I like that fine with sandwiches  but it s queso. Maybe there s beer in it. If so  I wish I had known that so I would ve known what to expect because that just killed it along with those f d up seasoned chips. This food is not Texas. Head to the food trailer park instead.  This place is some bullshit.
Asador,4,The tacos are good  but they are expensive and small. Hard to justify 3 bites for  8.
Asador,5,Not sure why it doesn t rate higher  you just order from window.  I had brisket taco  was damn good.  Little patio to sit with view of rainy street.  not much to go wrong.
Asador,6,Underserved Overpriced Tacos Ingredients were decent Tacos were half filled  20  Service charge included for a guy taking your order from a window
Asador,7,My husband and I ordered tacos and the service was awful. We were greeted by an extremely rude man with red hair and glasses  who seemed annoyed that we even were ordering food. The food was mediocre at best. Won t come back.
Asador,8,rainey street sucks but this place is worth it. damn good food  plenty of seating  and a nice break from the surrounding permanent shit show. don t blow it nerd
Asador,9,Great food. Just taste something and keep walking. Or they have a little patio. The asador torta was delish 
Taco Bell,1,The only reason to go to Taco Bell is quick late night food. So why is it this place always closes early    They seem to close up around midnight  lights are on people are inside  just cleaning and refusing to take orders. I mean if your open till one your open till then    Funny thing last time I went sat in line thinking they were open..... nope each person sat in line  tried to get their attention and had to drive off. Thanks for wasting everyone s time 
Taco Bell,2,Mold in my iced tea.  Twice.  Complaint website is down.  This should NEVER happen.
Taco Bell,3,I was wearing a mask when  in the drive-thru  I asked this manager why she wasn t wearing a mask. It literally says in the window that they suggest everyone wear masks. Her ENTIRE staff is wearing masks. She immediately got offended and said she  was vaxxed and boosted . I responded by saying most of us are  I am and vaxxed and boosted too  but thats besides the point. You can still spread the Omnicron to others. She then told me I was not ever welcome to come to this location ever again. I have literally been ostracized from a Taco Bell for asking the manager to be a patriotic American and save the lives of its customers. How fucked up is that  FUCK YOU TACO BELL   
Taco Bell,4,Customer should not have to ask for napkins. Handing a burrito out in a paper bag without a napkin is cheap  amp  not acceptable .
Taco Bell,5,Ridiculous quality. Don t give any of your hard earned money to this location. I think the picture speaks for itself. I m not sure why they are struggling so much  but time after time at this location I am disappointed. 6-3-21 Around 11AM. The only thing edible was the Baja blast  and quesadilla which had 2 pieces of meat inside and the outer slices were just tortilla.   Seems like this has been an ongoing process for a while  that hasn t been fixed based on old reviews I read. That being said  I will be going up to the location soon  showing them this review  and leave with a solution or my  20.20 back.
Taco Bell,6,They re usually good but I just had my boyfriend pick up a black bean crunchwrap and a bowl with rice and black beans and ordered literally 10 hot sauce and they gave me no hot sauce and so I ate the crunchwrap with a different sauce and therefore didn t notice THERE WAS MEAT IN THERE. I hope going forward they will pay more attention to vegetarian orders because I ve been vegetarian 10 years and this almost made me throw up. And this has happened at 2 different Taco Bell s as well where they just ignore the fact that it says black bean lol
Taco Bell,7,Horrible customer service. My boyfriend picked up dinner for the two of us at this location today. As he ordered my part of the meal  which was modified due to me being allergic to dairy  the cashier literally laughed AT him without breaking eye contact. Completely uncalled for  humiliating  and rude.
Taco Bell,8,Ordered my dinner from this place.  No sauce packets were included with my meal even though i asked for multiple packs.  I do not like my food without sauce so that was the first part of a really screwed up me.  Ordered 2 burritos with extra cheese  which i paid extra for .  No cheese added at all to either and very minimal beef and potatoes added to burrito.  These burritos were horrible...  Ordered 3 soft tacos which had barely any beef  cheese or onions.  Worst tacos I ve ever had and could only tolerate one.  Threw 2 away.    Ordered cinnamon bun as desert  guess what  it was even included in the bag but not surprised...  Tried calling their business as listed online but no answer even after about 30 rings.  You guys really think you deserve 15 dollars per hour based on your crappy packaging and customer service  lack of .    Wil never eat at Taco bell again.  They have zero pride in their products.
Taco Bell,9,customer service is way better then the other taco bell s in the area. everytime i come to get food at night they are always super nice and my order comes out correct.
Taco Bell,10,they got my order wrong  again  and didn t give me the receipt- also put wrong kind of sauce   this one always gets way too much wrong and it s dirty and gross   never eat here  
Taco Bell,11,Food was  fresh that s why they got 2 stars but they completely fucked up my order. I asked for extra cheese on my nachos  they gave me one drop   and gauc and they gave me some watery guacamole forgot the sour cream.
Taco Bell,12,I hesitate to leave 2-star reviews for any business  but this location has been slacking the last 3-5 visits. If they are out of something on the menu  they should post that at the drive-through or remove it from the menu. What keeps happening is that they are out of a menu item that I placed through  3 different  delivery services  and instead of seeing the note for the replacement  the order goes through anyway and they don t replace the item. So the last two times I got a delivery of  Just a drink  or just a side.
Taco Bell,13,I m basing this review under the assumption that everyone knows Taco Bell is a fast food chain.  With that said  it s not the best taco or burrito I ve had  but it s good. I ve always been a fan of theirs. The store is clean  the staff are professional  friendly  happy  accommodating  and hard working.  You can tell staff like their jobs and each other.  They also love dogs. The staff all make a fuss over my baby boy and talk to him through the drive through.  They re open late  it s fast  and cheap. I go here because the quality and service is consistent.  They always get my order right  too.
Taco Bell,14,Bad customer service at this location.  The guy taking the order seemed very defensive.  I don t give a Fu k what issues he has going on.  I m never coming back to this Taco Bell location.
Taco Bell,15,I ordered the taco salad without the rice   they fucked it up. I told then to exchange it. The chicken was bland. No taste to the salad at all. The most horrible salad ever. Should of choose taco cabana   they taste better and so are the prices.  Did I mentioned the mango tea has no mango taste. Never again.
Taco Bell,16,Came in to just get Cinnamon Twists and there s no cinnamon on them.  This has got to be the most collectively retarded group of people to work here to mess this up.   Lobby was dirty and the lobby was humid and hot on top of that.
Taco Bell,17,Don t use the online ordering option. I was surprised at all the customizing you can make on your order like removing ingredients and adding ingredients.  You can also just pick it up at the drive-thru by giving them your name. Easy enough. Well they don t bother customizing your order. They just give you whatever comes standard on their items.  I went back to just get my money back but they couldn t refund due to it being an online order. So I waited for them to correct the order. The online option is a great idea and would boost business if implemented right  but when the employees really don t care it will never work.
Taco Bell,18,Did not give me my full order. Paid  14 dollars for a bunch of tacos and i ordered a grillled stuffed burrito.
Taco Bell,19,When I went there  it had a sewage smell when you walked in. The bathrooms are very dirty and the soap dispensers didn t work  it made you question if the workers washed their hands. The food was sloppy and super greasy  everything would fall out when you picked it up and the food just tasted like it was sitting in pure grease. Overall it was disgusting  I have seen and tasted better Taco Bell.
Taco Bell,20,I work HVAC a hot job.I came here at lunch starving and only had a hundred dollar bill on me soaked in sweat at 1pm ordered over 25  worth of food and was told at 12 30 in the afternoon they would not be able to give me change and I could not order then the manager checked all the cash in other registers where I saw many 20 dollar bills and was told she had no change so this place will not accept large bills bet will check them repeatedly to see if they are counterfeit but will not accept them.
Taco Bell,21,The drive thru services was bad they did not let us talk or get nothing my order came out why do Taco Bell pays them to serve good food not bad food
Taco Bell,22,This taco bell skimps on toppings most of the times. My taco bell here tastes like an empty tortilla  very sad
Taco Bell,23,A true five  And you wouldn t think it by seeing the place  but after years of coming here they have yet to get my order wrong even a single time. Not once. On top of that  the service and friendly faces truly stand out. The WiFi has always been working when I needed it  and it s super chill. Here s hoping they re an app location soon 
Taco Bell,24,Love this Taco Bell. We come here all the time and the staff is so nice. Not sure why the reviews are so bad
Taco Bell,25,5 stars for the lady working the drive thru at midnight. Haven t even tried the food yet but we left in such a good mood because of her awesome attitude.     receipt says her name is Lee P 
Taco Bell,26,How do you run out of beef        On a Sunday night     Be better prepared. That is simply unprofessional and ludicrous. Get it together Taco Bell. Off to McDonalds I go. You ve lost a loyal customer.
Taco Bell,27,I ordered the 5 dollars special it come with one soft taco and 1 crispy taco I loved it
Taco Bell,28,Where to start  Jessica who is working tonight was completely rude and disrespectful. She should NOT work here if she wants to be rude and disrespectful. I wanted to order a number 4. What she did was put each item on individually which made the cost more. I am not sure if she was pocketing that extra money or not. Yeah it was only .40 difference  but still that is one type of employee I would not want working for my business. Also the taco I got had nothing but brown lettuce.
Taco Bell,29,In a time like Austin Texas were tacos are number one you would think a chain with the name like Taco Bell would do better. Ordered chicken soft tacos got shredded chicken soft tacos such a small portion I was able to put it all in one tortilla since the other ones broke in half. Best part about my lunch was the chicken was ice cold. When I called to talk to the manager they tried to put my name on a list and I responded with no thank you I ll never be eating at any Taco Bell ever again in my entire existence on this planet
Taco Bell,30,It s a regular Taco Bell. When I went in it was deserted since it was an off-time.  But as I waited for my food  some guy came in and was clearly so thankful to the staff for having found his lost cell phone or something.  So I guess the staff is kind and thoughtful.
Taco Bell,31,Around 11pm  the drive-thru took 18 mins and everything I ordered was freezing cold. I also realized a couple miles down the road that I was given the wrong order  but I wasn t about to turn around and sit in line another 20 minutes for that.
Taco Bell,32,Rude service at the drive thru. The shredded chicken burrito taste awful  like chicken gone bad  awful  and they are our of their signature drink Baja blast which is a customer favorite  Too bad there isn t another location closer. Funny how they are holding interviews for positions as I guess most of the good staff left and I would want to work here neither if was the last place on earth 
Taco Bell,33,Worst Taco Bell location in Austin  The Man who took my order was rude and when I couldn t hear him because he was talking low on the speaker he yelled at me with an attitude  Then when I got to the window he snatched my money then I had to basically reach over into the drive through window to grab my food  Then not to mention my whole order was wrong  Wtf  
Taco Bell,34,Several years ago I stopped my 3 days a week Taco Bell habit.  I explained to my co-workers and family that the meat  beef  tasted different.  I didn t like the texture nor the flavor.   Well  now we all know why    Yesterday  for the first time in months  I stopped in there in a hurry to order a bean burrito.  OMG. I waited in line 10 minutes to order and another 18 minutes to pick up my order.  They spent much of their time refunding folks their money.  It s called fast food for a reason - bring in some staff at lunch time. Tables and floor filthy.
Taco Bell,35,It s taco bell... Nothing special EXCEPT their cheap and filling double deckers  The cherry limeaid Sparkler is the best out there  Mmm carbonation
NuclearTacos,1,  Caveat reader  I helped serve up delicious mouth-pain at this event for a couple years. That being said  I didn t make any money from it  and I don t think the organizers do  either. I consider this more of a public service than a business  clearing the sinuses of SXSW Interactive attendees. C mon  you look a little stuffed up. Have a taco   So  I know these people  and you won t find a friendlier group of geeks who share a love of very spicy noms. You get to assemble your own taco  soft or crunchy   starting with ground beef that usually comes in  hot    extra hot   and  vegetarian.  There is no mild. There is no medium. You get spicy tacos or you get spicier tacos. Don t be so quick to brush off the vegetarian pseudo-beef as any kind of slouch  either. With no beef fat to soak up the heat  sometimes these end up being the spicier ones on the table.   While I mourn the lack of cilantro and onion for the tacos  the emphasis with the add-ons table isn t really flavor so much as  um   damage control.  Lettuce and tomato might help soak up a little heat  but your best bet is with the cheese and sour cream. I don t like sour cream  so my tacos usually consist of a bit of beef and a huge pile of cheese.   If your balls are much  much larger than your brain  please enter the eating contest. They ll serve up the spiciest batch of taco meat they can make.   Usually there s some kind of worthy cause to donate to via jars on the table.  11 was tsunami relief for Japan and  12 was Caritas in memory of Leslie. Stuff a couple bucks in the jar and thank your friendly taco cooks.   The crowd at Nuclear Tacos is always a blast. I met the  Ow  My Balls   guy here one year. Oh yes  that means that my life is pretty much complete now.   If it comes back next year  drop by and indulge in a little foodie masochism. These tacos RULE.
NuclearTacos,2,YeHAW   Nucleartacos hosted a party at SXSW 2009  and it blew the panties off the Austin Hot Sauce Festival.  The party was free to the public with all you can eat tacos  2 complimentary adult beverages  and all you can drink Fuze  Sierra Mist  and Pepsi.  Also  there was a truck handing out free ice cream.    These tacos are HOT.  In addition to regular spices in the meat  they also added heaping scoops of minced habaneros.  The meat came in 2 5 atomic bombs  4 5 atomic bombs  and the veggie came in 2 5 atomic bombs.  There were two men cooking the meat up front.  One of which commented that I should see what else he could do at home.  But them he pointed to his finger and said   But I m married.    I replied   That s okay. I m a lesbian.   The two chicks from Philly behind me burst into laughter.   I started off with just 2 tacos packed with carne  just a bit of cheese  some tomatoes  lettuce  and sour cream sauce.    I ate with the two girls behind me and some other strangers  and yes  I cried.  I had a full cup of the 2 5 mixture straight up.  I think if I had a smaller portion of carne  it wouldn t have been so bad.  After I cooled my mouth  I walked down to Speakeasy for their free food and drink party.  On my way  I spotted Amber D. and asked her to tag along.   Speakeasy s was dead.  I ve never seen a SXSW event so dead.  And there was no food or drinks that we could see 20 minutes after the advertised time.  Amber D. and I made our way back Brush Creek Park for more tacos and drinks.  I had another 2 tacos  and I put the sour cream sauce on them so they were barely spicy the second time around.  Haberno Joy   There was also a taco eating contest  but I already had dinner plans in 15 minutes.    5 stars for   Tacos with a kick  Complimentary Drinks Complimentary Ice Cream and the weather happened to be gorgeous
