Chipotle Mexican Grill,1,If I could give this chipotle more stars I would   My boyfriend and I order take out from this chipotle at least once a week and every time we order  it s exactly what we re looking for... we have never ordered online and gotten anything less different for almost six months now... great customer service 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,2,Restaurant was very clean when we walked in.  The food looked very fresh  and the employees were eager to serve us. Unfortunately  we just popped in to cool off for some drinks  so we did not have the food. However  the auga fresas were very tasty--especially the lemonade.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,3,Always had chipotle as a go to when needed a quick good meal. Today completely disappointed this is just unsatisfactory. I don t know what happened but this ruins it. I went and picked something else up better that was more appealing looking
Chipotle Mexican Grill,4,This was my first time enjoying the delicacy of Chipotle Mexican Grill  and all I can say is  Wow  . The tantalizing taste I experienced when the chicken burrito with rice  pinto beans  cream  and corn was life changing. I sincerely do not believe I will ever taste a burrito quite like this one  and I am excited to come back and try the other flavors they have at this establishment. The customer service was superb  but I unfortunately do not remember any of their names. Would definitely recommend this restaurant since I ve never heard of it before and people should definitely hop aboard this chipotle train.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,5,Positively the slowest most disorganized Chipolte I have ever been too. Slow slow slow    Orders never ready on-time 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,6,Excellent and delicious food  Fast delivery. Great place to dine or order out  We enjoyed all the food snd have ordered several times since the pandemic.  Great customer service snd delivery time.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,7,It s a standard chipotle.  I ve eaten here for years and never had any issues with pickup  takeout  or delivery. Staff always seem nice
Chipotle Mexican Grill,8,Bad    Found a hair in my chicken     Ordered the burrito bowl with chicken and there was a hair on one of the chicken pieces. Yuck  Disgusting  Can t imagine eating at a chipotle ever again in my life 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,9,I always go to chipotle  one of my favorite spots  but avoid this location  the service was horrible  the workers behind the counter were very unfriendly  they told my daughter she couldn t get an extra tortilla.  My daughter is 11  give me a break  
Chipotle Mexican Grill,10,Exhausted and tired after a busy day running around Austin and we just wanted an easy dinner.  When we got there they had just finished making new rice and the steak was out.  The girls at the front were really nice and gave us free drinks while they made us fresh steak.  It took about 4 minutes.  By the time we left all of the food was fresh.  It was one of the best burrito bowls I have had.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,11,So  I m biased. I m a loyal Chipotle customer    Since everyone knows what Chipotle is and most locations are the same in quality of food and service  I normally would not write a review. BUT I currently work at the Capitol  and got to this Chipotle quite often for lunch  And they ve always been great but today they went above and beyond     I left my wallet at work and I told them I would walk back to the office to grab my money and then come back for my burrito  They said absolutely not and comped my burrito    I m going to leave a big tip next time I m there 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,12,For a chipotle downtown austin they tend to run out of everything  today they didn t have meat or chicken  whoever is in charge of their ordering really need to do a better job.  And I eat here weekly and every week they manage to run out of something.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,13,It s a freaking Chipotle and not really ever my first choice for lunch  but let me tell you a thing  I ve been here three times now since starting my new job in January and they are reliable as heck. That s like more times than I ve eaten at a Chipotle in the past year  okay  so you know I m not messing around.  I value consistency in my life and this place is always consistent. If the line is long  they ve got the process down to a tee and it moves very quickly. They re excellent at getting people their food in a timely and efficient manner. My burrito bowls are also always consistent - same amount of each food item each time and it s wonderful. You don t have to worry about getting that one person who is stingy with the meat or something because nobody is stingy with anything. Everything just works exactly the way you would expect it to work.   That s basically the only thing I could ever ask for when eating fast food and this place nails it. Consistency is key and now they ve got themselves a repeat customer.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,14,Relatively cheap downtown lunch option  Check Portion size   big  Check Ability to order online to bypass giant lunch crowd  bingo.  Save yourself half an hour by ordering online and picking it up at the side window. You ll thank me later.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,15,I ordered pork tacos and within an hour and half  I was throwing up violently.  The sad part was all the money I had spent on SXSW and then was sick for two days of the conference.  The pork was bad and it ate me alive.  When I called to tell them  they were unsympathetic and told me they would tell someone else so they could call me.  I was just trying to warn them that their pork was bad.  Good news is I lost 5 lbs overnight.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,16,Do NOT order for delivery on the Chipotle website.  It sends it to a 3rd party  Door Dash  and if they don t show up to pick up the food you have no options  no recourse for resolution.  The restaurant won t deliver  they say you have to contact corporate but give you an email instead of a phone number  corporate says you have to contact Door Dash even though the money was removed from my bank account by Chipotle  and Door Dash support says there s a  special team  to deal with their vendor deals but they hung up on me  twice  when  transferring  me.  If you have time to go over and pick up  great  If you re at work and can t leave your desk  don t do the online ordering.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,17,First of all  anyone who isn t familiar with this location should be warned that parking is not easy to come by     Now that we got that out of the way I can tell you about my great experience here this week. First of all  the place as so unbelievably clean  all Chipotle s are . The staff kept what seemed like an aggressively long line moving that what could have been a 20 minute wait was more like 5  The staff was extremely accommodating to wanting a burrito bowl but wanting a tortilla on the side  salsa on the side and other random picky eater requests. I walked out with a very filling and delicious meal withing about 6 minutes and only spent about  8. Chipotle can do no wrong in my book and this is now my favorite location 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,18,Excellent location. Lots of walkability. I found parking in the area the other day quite easily. Phenomenal view of the capitol building to lunch by.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,19,This venue gets 4 stars because it s just as good as any other location.  What takes it down a star are its odd hours and skimpy portions.  C mon  man 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,20,I walked in with my boyfriend 10 minutes before closing and received great customer service. The food was tasty and hot and we were not rushed at all. Quinton was very friendly and personable and came over to check on us a few times. He is definitely a great representation of the company. Will be returning soon.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,21,Love Chipotle and this location. BTW  the company IS NOT OWNED by McDonalds.   a href   redir url http 3A 2F 2Fmobile.businessweek.com 2Farticles 2F2013-10-03 2Fchipotle-the-one-that-got-away-from-mcdonalds amp s 514ada57d5603894dd1677ea0c2cd7ac2f0a1db4517243646b8b8360bf295fb1  rel  nofollow  target  _blank  mobile.businessweek.com    a 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,22,I don t mind Chipotle. During lunch time on the weekdays  this place becomes loud and the line is long. They crank the music up which in turns everyone tries to talk over the loud music. The acoustics in the place doesn t help. My friend and I had to take our food to go because we couldn t stand how loud it is.  It s helpful they have menus while you are waiting in line. Be ready to let the employees know what you want because they are quick in getting your food.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,23,Good Stuff  but when you add in a drink  chips or any other extras  lunch will cost you over  10.   Since it is such a belly stuffer  I usually only eat here when I am very hungry  or know I will not have time or access to food later in the evening.  Lines get longish  but swift. They will take your order in line and let you pay via credit card before you ever get to submit your order to the person who makes your food.   Lots of seats in the dining room with big windows and natural light.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,24,Let me just say that you will be hard-pressed to find a cheaper  more efficient place for lunch in downtown Austin during the workweek.  If you come here during the noon lunchtime stampede  be prepared that the line may be at the door.  But believe me when I say that it moves fast   You will be through the line and paying in about 15 minutes  tops.  I m actually a big fan of this chain as a whole  as you can taste that their ingredients are fresh.  And if you know what to choose  you can even get a decently healthy lunch  maybe just a little on the salty side .   Hands down  best Chipotle establishment I ve been to.  Plenty of seating if you plan to stay and eat  the food is always fresh  and they re good about re-filling their ingredients in the assembly line   and the best part   They have the assembly line nailed perfectly.  These are master burrito crafters here folks.  And the even bester part   You can get delicious satisfaction for just  6.25. And the even BESTEST part    You can accomplish this all in 15 minutes during your lunch hour.  Thanks to everyone at this location for making my lunchtime hassle-free 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,25,I eat at Chipotle all the time and love the food  this location is no exception. I wanted to leave this one a review  however  to call out Quentin  one of the employees there. He s super helpful  takes initiative  and is relentlessly positive. Really appreciate his hard work and awesome attitude.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,26,I m a man of routine. When I was in college  I went to chipotle 3 times a week after journalism class. Now  I eat at this chipotle every day for lunch with my coworkers. Chipotle makes routine awesome and delicious.  Chipotle on 8th and congress is no different than many other branches. It has incredibly fast and efficient service. The food is consistently delicious.   This chipotle  however  goes above and beyond. The lunch time rush is crazy and they manage to keep it quick  pro tip  avoid lunchtime rush from 12-130 . Their burrito bowl is my go-to. Double black beans  chicken  barbacoa  and guac...delicious   The only downfall is that they re closed on weekends. I miss my drunk chipotle   
Chipotle Mexican Grill,27,Always consistent and very fast. This Chipotle gets very busy because it s the only one in downtown. Be ready to wait in line for at least 15-20 minutes during the lunch rush. If your in a rush make sure you download the Chipotle app and place your order on there to expedite the ordering process.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,28,I come here at least once a week for lunch.  Before you judge me for being incredibly boring- this place is two literally two blocks away from our office  it s cheap  and you can order ahead online   While not my favorite thing in the world  Chipotle gets the job done as far as quickly getting people in and out AND their order online thing is GREAT- especially if you don t care to wait.  They also have margaritas that you  have to drink there  righhhhht   
Chipotle Mexican Grill,29,I enjoyed my visit to Chipotle.   I thought the Burrito was great and tasted fresh  the price wasn t too bad  and the staff was patient with me  I was a Chipolte virgin .   I ll come back here in the future if I happen to be near one at lunch time--but I wouldn t make any special trips.   Here it comes.... ready ..... ok......  Its better then Freebirds.  There...... I said it.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,30,Once you ve tried it  you know what you re going to get every time  and that s comforting if you like it -- and I do. Big burritos  biggish tacos  or a slightly lower carb version in a bowl with your very basic selection of fillings. I like the chunky toppings  pico de gallo and corn salsa   but the smoother salsas aren t exciting  and they water down a burrito that s likely to get soggy anyway if you can t finish it in one sitting  as I often cannot.  They put too much rice on the burritos -- I always ask for half a scoop. If I didn t get the veggie  which comes with guacamole  I d hate to pay extra for it. I always get my food to go at this location  and I ve never had to wait in line  but that s likely because I ve always come closer to 1 30 or 2  not peak businessman lunch hour. Filling and tasty  but nothing spectacular.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,31,This is my first Chipotle experience.  I was in Downtown Austin for the Film Festival and needed dinner between films  but didn t want to break the bank.  They had extended their hours and were open until 8pm  which was great since I entered at 7 50pm.  The venue was clean and had a few people inside.  It was almost closing time.  The girl making my order I selected a bowl with shredded beef  white rice pinto beans  salsa  and corn salsa.  shredded beef had a thick texture and had a strong beef taste which was very good and blended in well with the other ingredients.  The meal tasted very good and was definitely worth more than the price.  I would definitely come here again.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,32,I prefer FreeBirds to Chipotle  but in a pinch for a big burrito with lots of fixin s  Chipotle will do the trick.    I actually think many of the materials available for your burrito pleasure are superior at Chipotle.  Also  the atmoshpere is a little less outlandish and even when it s crowded  there is generally a place to sit.    That said  I think that Chipotle may as well be a fast food burrito stand.  The employees of the locations I have been to seem to be doing what is expected of them and little more.  Plus  some of the sauces salsas fail to excite me the way FreeBird s offering often do.    Chipotle is a decent place to get lunch  and I eat there on occassion.  However  the difference in  food and attitude  between here and Freebirds is that I never say   Man  Chipotle sure sounds good  but rather   I m in the mood for a burrito and Chipotle is nearby.   3 stars.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,33,I greatly appreciate the amount of seating they have at this place  and for that I salute you.  to many places downtown are to small for lunch time crowds.  And for all the fast food burrito places  this place really has the most fresh tasting and well seasoned food.  I m a fan of both the carnitas and chicken.    Two things needed   1  more options  I can t even thing of what these options may be  but I like choices and they don t have many  2  frequent visitors cards  granted I don t visit here alot  and I always forget to get the stupid cards stamped  but they should have it anyway 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,34,I m embarassed to admit that I like food made at a restaurant owned by McDonald s...but Chipotle inspires me to do just that.  Tasty fast-food Mexican fare served up just the way you like it - as a burrito  a salad  in tacos  or as a  bowl   a burrito w o the tortilla .  You can get a delicious  fresh  very filling meal in minutes for around  6  choose your meat  your beans  your salsa and veggies  give them a yea or nay on cheese and sour cream  they throw it together with some fluffy rice  and you re good to go.      It s right downtown  so the line gets long  but they ve got the service down to such a tee that it moves super fast.  Also  it s walking distance from my office  so I can hoof it there and back and walk off 1 10 000th of my meal that way.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,35,Closed Saturday  amp  Sunday   What    These hours shouldn t be downtown Austin. Move to this one to the country  amp  put in a REAL Chipotle 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,36,Why do people who profess their hate for McDonald s set foot in here  let alone review this place   I profess my love for Chipotle. A great place to get a cal-style bigass burrito. 1000  calories of pure meaty joy.  I really recommend the barbacoa -- I went to this place for years before trying it and it is awesome  The chicken is very good too. The beef is a little on the tough side  and the carnitas is not good unless you really like plain pork.  Other pluses  rice is very tasty  black beans have good flavor  hottest salsa is very hot  they serve beer  and even when the place is packed you get your food very fast. Minuses  their price for adding guacamole is like  1.50  luckily I don t like guacamole on burritos  It s also common to have the staff ask you two or three times what type of meat you want. And after eating a whole chipotle burrito  you want to crawl into your cave and hibernate for the winter. That may be a plus.  I slightly prefer Freebird s only because they offer tons of fresh cilantro as a topping  and Chipotle does not  and I m a cilantro addict. The core burrito ingredients are slightly better at Chipotle  IMHO.  Disclaimer  I love McDonald s. And all big evil corporations.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,37,As far as Chipotles go  it s not too different. If you re going for lunch  get there right when they open at 11 or else you ll be waiting in line for 20 minutes.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,38,Looks like I ll be the first to slag on Chipotle...  One of my biggest complaints is that they charge you for extra salsa. That s just nutso. This is Texas damnit   The burritos are more or less California Mission style  the ingredients seem fresh and they are generally tasty. However  they just seem kinda boring to me anytime I ve had one. I don t leave the place feeling satisfied. Full  but not satisfied.  I also tend to avoid this place because they are owned by McDonalds.  Freebirds is a step up for this kind of burrito  many more choices of ingredients   but I d rather save a couple bucks and get a burrito at a local Taqueria instead.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,39,When I saw the billboards about the happy chickens and pigs  I had to go back and try it again. The meat is dang tasty and the rice has a clean  fresh  fluffiness about it. I still flog myself when I get home for eating the flesh of an innocent critter who was murdered for my gluttony  but it s pretty much worth it. When I heard Chipotle was owned by McDonald s corporation  I almost launched my half-digested burrito out the car window. Went home for some more flogging. But then I figured  screw that   If a big evil corporation is making the effort to be not-so-evil  then it s our job as consumers to show them it will pay off.  So put your money where your mouth is and go eat yummy dead animals at Chipotle. One gripe  sometimes the food is kind of cold  like the atmosphere . Ditto  it s bigger and better than Freebirds.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,40,Its always crowded. The line is always long. The fact that it is owned by Mickey D s is somewhere in the back of your mind. The burritos are expensive....but somehow  once you see the size and freshness of the human sized burrito you are about to purchase  all that goes straight out the window.  I admit that I am seriously in like with Chipotle. The food never disappoints. You know what you are getting  you know the choices  you know it will be good and large. Nothings really wrong with it  except the price  and hey you are getting quite alot of food  so the cheap skate in me isn t complaining too much.   Come here for a quick lunch on the go. You might be surprised by how much you like it.  Warning  Think up alternate ways to eat the burrito. Sometimes it is so huge you can barely bite into it. Imaginative techniques must be employed.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,41,I feel like Austinites generally hate Chipotle  or love it.  OMG it s a chain wahhh wahhh.   Myself  I love Chipotle. Always have  always will. Sometimes I just sit around and really  really want a taco. Or a delicious salad. Maybe some chips and guacamole. Yes  I work right next door to Taco Shack  so for all you people on here complaining about Chipotle  I suggest you go to Taco Shack for lunch time one day and then you will really see the goldmine that Chipotle is.  It s usually pretty crowded  but I think the staff management does a great job by moving the line along. Sometimes a nice employee will go down the line so you can pay before even ordering which really speeds things up. They also have a separate door for pick up orders-- not every Chipotle does these things kids.   Really  the biggest downer for me is that Chipotle doesn t have queso. C mon  if you re going to be a fast food  mexican  joint  at least bring on the queso.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,42,They had quite a long line  3 4 of the way to the door  and only one person serving people  she had to go all the way down the line for each person. They had a number of employees wandering around doing other things  apparently what they had to do was more important than dealing with customers.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,43,Who cares if you work for the man  MickeyD s  baby   I mean  I work for the man  too.  Whatever.  We all gotta make a dolla.  I ve got the hots for you in a bad way my sweet  fresh  healthyish  hormone-free  delicious Chipotle.    Your rice is a product of divine inspiration and your guac is a little piece of heaven in my mouth.  I love ordering via the interwebs  running over a few mins later  skipping the line that is often out the door  and going right to the front to pick my ish up.   I love that about you   You re so quick and easy like none of the other girls are.    I blow you kisses daily from across the street  Chipotle.  Even when I m eating elsewhere  I m secretly thinking about you.  Call me.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,44,Now I love ALL Chipotles on the earth  but this one holds a special place in my heart.  One day I decided that it would be a really good idea to order food online to pick up at like 5 15 after I got off work.  But then when I called this lady was like   yo we close at 5  sorry.   Oh noes     But have no fear...that was just a temporary setback.  I went on the corporate website and wrote a little email saying   hey people  there are lots of lazy professionals like myself downtown who would like to order dinner and pick it up after 5...what s the deal    Then this super nice lady  I m guessing the manager from the place on Congress  called me back and she was like   oh my gosh you can TOTALLY pick up food after 5 any time you want       she meant like...a little bit after 5  since they re still cleaning up and closing down at that point anyway...probably up to 5 30 or so   And then to apologize she offered me free Chipotle for up to 5 people   I ended up taking her up on free Chipotle for me and 1 other friend....I didn t want to get too carried away.  But I thought that was really nice and emblematic of how much they are trying to attract business and give top service.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,45,Chips and hot salsa only.  FYI-the copious amounts of salt on the chips are hotter than the hot salsa. I m eating them anyway  so they must still be pretty good.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,46,Pretty fresh Chipotle with quick service. We came here twice in our 5-day Austin stay. It s a good location if you re staying downtown  just sucks that it s not open on the weekends.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,47,I love Chipotle. I am a big fan and I eat here quite a bit  more so because Austin has a limited amount of quality burrito places. It s definitely not the healthiest food you could eat  the tortilla alone has 300 calories   but everyone needs a break from their diet once in a while  and what the hell it s pretty tasty. And seriously you should be able to skip your next meal.  As for this downtown Chipotle in particular I have a couple tips  -the line at lunch time backs up to the door  but if you order on-line or via iPhone app you can walk right up to the counter  also they usually throw in a free drink if you order this way  -throw your business card in the vase.  i have won it 4 times  and the rest of my office has won it few times as well  -if you re not ready for them to douse your entire burrito in hot sauce  you can ask for the hot sauce on the side  and they ll give it to you in a little container  it s perfect for take away 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,48,Wowza it s crowded. I avoid this location like the plague at lunchtime. But often I get called upon to pick up various burritos and bowls for my employers. Call it in or get ready to wait. Yesterday the line was out the door...Chipotle s so popular.   Because it is so busy I feel like the food is fresher than at a deserted Chipotle. If you re into eating two pounds of food at a time and you don t mind waiting  enjoy.  Any other location will take half the time.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,49,Line was out the door today as well  I like Chipotle s so I stayed in line. Some of the employees were taking your order as you were standing in line to speed things up. As I was doing that  I realized that after standing in line for 15 or so minutes I had forgotten my wallet   I asked if I could go ahead and place my order since I had been in line for a while  run out to my car and then come back to pick up my food  they immediately said  sure thing no worries.  So when I got to the cashier  I reminded them that I was just going to run out to get my wallet  but the manager told me not to worry  that it was on the house  Wow  I was very pleasantly surprised   Thanks Chipotle s that was a very nice thing to do and I ll make sure I come back  with money this time    - 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,50,How does a place with fresh ingredients  incredible value  friendly staff  and perfect guac go without five stars   This is a no-brainer if you work downtown.   Healthy ish  filling  and fast.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,51,Overpriced crap. Freebird is way better.  CMG has high prices and stuffs their burritos with a bunch of rice.  No good.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,52,I could see how someone working in food service during SXSW might be a bit discouraged by all drunken chaos throughout March  but this Chipotle boasts smiley  speedy  and delightful employees.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,53,I ve gone to this place several times since I work downtown.  I ordered my salad online and was relatively disappointed... They forgot to put in the most important ingredient  the dressing    And the salad looked more like a burrito bowl   
Chipotle Mexican Grill,54,I love Chipotle  so I was excited when I discovered one in the middle of downtown. Just a few things bothered me.  First of all  I hate how it s closed on the weekends and their hours are terrible  closing at 6 on weekdays  I know this is for business purposes because their busy times are during lunch breaks for anyone working downtown  but I wish they could have normal chipotle hours  maybe 11am to 10pm and open on weekdays   Another thing is whenever I go there  I get steak and they never have it ready. During the slow times  they don t even have steak prepared  so I have to wait like 15 minutes while my steak is being cooked. And they make it medium rare  even if I ask for medium well  which is very irritating. Once they offered me a free drink while I wait  but usually I m just standing there awkwardly.   I ll always love chipotle  but I have to avoid this one because of its inconvenience.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,55,I gave them a four star because the food was great   the dining area was clean  the interior design of the restaurant was very... Hmmm how shall I put this Eco friendly  modern  they used a lot of wood  metal  amp  tin... Very sleek and open.  Finally the four start is for their reasonable prices   Now for the ummms... - parking was a bit difficult... - servers could be a little nicer - where s the Chipotle sign outside    Thankfully we had yelp  and was able to confirm they were open and where they were located   Overall I enjoyed it   Wish we could have a Chipotle in Hawaii 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,56,I went in during the lunch time rush and was really kicking myself for not ordering ahead online. But  to my surprise  I was out of there in under 15 minutes. The line stretched the entire length of the room  but it never came to a halt. This staff has it down. I was so pleased with how quickly they took care of everyone  and without mistakes. Thanks Chipotle 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,57,First of all  They are NOT a subsidiary of McDonalds   a href   redir url http 3A 2F 2Fthestir.cafemom.com 2Ffood_party 2F125679 2Fmyth_that_mcdonalds_owns_chipotle amp s 0bbf4d555a9820f27719c06e7e8373d40d49d1963cbd8d34abb559904cabf62d  rel  nofollow  target  _blank  thestir.cafemom.com food   a   Second of all  Get a delicious burrito bowl with lots of veggies and enjoy it.  Chiptole actually tries to buy local and be green  support them 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,58,This Chipotle is the closest to my place  however it closes everyday at 6 pm. I cry every time. Other then that it s great.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,59,Despite being a subsidiary of McDonalds  and based mostly on the fact that this location is 2 blocks from work  I had been a frequenting the establishment.  It seems that there has been a direct correlation between popularity and portion size  with salads anyway  at this location.  The salad option here was a hearty one  but lately they have been very small portions and since it is 60  nutrition less lettuce  it just doesn t cut the mustard anymore...anyway  if paying upwards of  7 for a salad  w guacamole  there are better options  that offer more than 2 oz. of meat  one tbsp. of beans  and some decent salsa....  Cheers
Chipotle Mexican Grill,60,I call this place the Bang for the Buck Bonanza  large portions for those looking to share a burrito with your 3 person family  4 if we are talking very small people . The decor has the charm of a WW2 bomb factory  but who cares if it is located in the heart of town in a historical building. The taste was just like any other mexican food joint  really  with enough hot sauce  it is all the same.   Overall I think it is great if one is hungry and wants a healthy choice of fresh veggies  grilled veggies and lean meat.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,61,Lunch can be super busy. Either get there when they open at 11a or order online  designate a pick-up time  and pick it up accordingly. The veggies tacos are the best 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,62,I would like to reiterate that Chipotle is not part of McDonalds. However  this is not the best Chipotle in town. It s big and has lots of seating  but the chairs are super-uncomfortable. However  my salad tasted alright.  I liked the spicy dressing and the generous portion of chicken. But next time  I m going back to my regular favorite  the barbacoa burrito.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,63,You can t go wrong with Chipotle. I like how this one is just a hop  skip and a jump away from work. It s still has that Chipotle  modern-metal decor but EVERYBODY who comes here is some corporate dude wearing a suit. But hey  the burritos are quickly made and served with fluffy white rice with -- I think -- peas. I don t remember that detail at other Chipotles...
Chipotle Mexican Grill,64,Someone please notify Yelp that this place is claiming to be  Mexican  food. There should be a law about miscategorizing food this way and or giving the real deal a such bad name. This is false advertising. The guy who started this chain took cooking classes in New York and all the sudden thinks he knows how to make Mexican food.    NEW YORK CITY     This place gets two stars because it is close to where I work. The other three are missing because you are Chipotle and your food is always extremely bland and far too salty.  I get and appreciate that the idea here is to serve Organic food  or whatever  but the fact that there is so much salt in it completely defeats the purpose  and thus the scathe.  Aside from the salt  my biggest complaint is about the understaffed labor being in too much of a hurry to take the time to listen to your order  even when its slow. That process is awkward in this place as it is  and because everyone on the line is new to the job and probably new to having a job in general  it s even worse. When you start to order you immediately get interrupted with some random question about it and the conversation never has a chance to return to a normal flow. The situation deteriorates into an inconsistent series of yes or no questions  vague hand gestures  grunts  shouts over other people  and being unsure of who has your food and what they are doing with it and whether or not you should tell them what you want on it or the next person - only to be bum rushed by the cash register without even getting a chance to tell the cashier what size drink you want  if any.  There should be a spring loaded tile in front of the cash register that ejects people through the roof  or maybe just two really big dudes who throw you out of the store as soon as the cashier has your money. That would be the only thing faster about and less human about this experience.  I don t understand why people eat here and really wish that they wouldn t. This corporate chain  owned by McDonald s no less  should be boycotted so a real Mexican food joint can open up  so we can have some culture back.  Come on Austin  you can do better than this. The food here is not that great at all and the employees are obviously treated horribly.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,65,You can order online  amp  pick up at the to go window out back.  You get to  skip  the ordering line.  WHAT  that is outrageous  Soooo worth it.  Gigantic.Burrito.  And I love their cilantro rice -- I went to A amp M  so I feel a little traitorous loving this more than Freebirds  but whatevs  it is yummy  quick  easy  and good.  And relatively cheap  though not cheap enough for me to go everyday  hello    2-2.50 tacos at El Chilito right nearby  .  But I could eat half and save the other half for dinner  so maybe it works out to  3.50-4 per meal  which then becomes mighty cheap  Yes  that is brilliant justification...
Chipotle Mexican Grill,66,There was not one  but TWO festivals on congress ave today. There was a film festival right next to 8th street  and a massive book festival that ran from 8th street to the capital. There were hundreds of people walking around and every restaurant was packed during lunchtime... till well after 2pm maybe later. Even quiznos was packed. But one restaurant had no one in it -one restaurant that was maybe 100 feet from the massive cspan book  tv tent  and a half a block from the film festival. Today I waited for 10 minutes in a long line at quiznos at 2pm for a sandwich with my child and husband  when we would have much rather had a Chipotle burrito. I guess y all don t like money  because you lost thousands today.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,67,HAVE THE WEIRDEST HOURS     With all the downtown condos  events  State Capitol  and hotels  I am shocked to discover they are only open Monday-Friday 11-6pm.  Everything else is a typical Chipolte. STAY OPEN ON WEEKENDS AND LATER     LAME
Chipotle Mexican Grill,68,Very consistent and convenient.  I go here for lunch usually a couple times a week.  They are good about using a remote credit card machine during peak times to keep the line moving.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,69,If you go during lunch  you may experience a LONG line but it moves kinda fast.  I tend to go around 11 30a or 1 00p  as the line isn t so long during that time.  I haven t had the chance to dine-in  because it is usually crowded during the times I go.    I love the burrito bowls  but the seasoning has been hit or miss.  Some days the meat is seasoned great  while other days it may be bland.  Same goes for the rice.  You get large portions though.  I have seen people ask for  a little more  if they want more.  Be prepared to order when it s your turn in line  because the ordering process moves quite fast at this location.  You can order online or via app and you can walk right to the pickup window.  Very fast pace at lunch.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,70,everything tastes the same no matter what you order. the guac is good but the chips are too salty. theres also the abuse of human rights issue which makes anything  even guacomole  tough to enjoy.
La Santa Barbacha,1,The barbacoa here is unmatched  So juicy and flavorful but not heavy. The salsa they provide is so good as well. I also tried another taco called Benito with chicharron  beans  barbacoa  cojita  and avocado - this was so tasty and delicious. I can t wait come back and try more    Also - they are newer so prepare for slower service as many people are ordering here constantly.  Cheers 
La Santa Barbacha,2,Their Barbacoa is fantastic and the corn tortillas are so fresh and not crumbly at all. I definitely enjoyed the Barbacha taco that is stuffed with Barbacoa and while the Benito was good  it didn t blow me away with the chicarron being a bit soggy and the taco overly salty. The hot sauces do provide a pleasant kick as well so try a little at a time if you re not a super spice fan.   Pricing wise  tacos are about  5 each  which is a little pricey for small tacos. But overall they do a great job so I don t mind grabbing some and hanging out in the Native Hostel s backyard to enjoy them in the sun.   Found this food truck in the back of Native Hostel  so expect to be street parking to get access .
La Santa Barbacha,3,Native has a winner right here  The barbacoa tacos are great as they are and a staple of the menu. But the item that is an absolute must is the Quesabaracha  It s like a quesadilla version of the barbacoa and omg... If it was societally acceptable  I would marry that thing and never leave it. Except for when I eat it and need to marry another one.   You need to add this to your list 
La Santa Barbacha,4,Why are food trucks so fun   We got the crispy cheese tacos expecting them to be small but these things are pretty good sized and very filling.  Instead of a tortilla  the barbacoa and chicharron is in a crispy shell of fried cheese.  We loved the green tomatillo salsa.  And  the best part- pink horchata- homemade with real strawberries 
La Santa Barbacha,5,Great place to grab drinks. I tried their pink horchata  which was perfect and not too sweet.
La Santa Barbacha,6,10 10 W0WWWW This place is a freakin golden nugget of taco trucks man. Their barbacoa taco is elite and their salsas are approved by my Mexican mom. Their tortillas are fresh and hand made and delicious. The aguas frescas were so good and I loved how they were refreshing and tasty instead of just sugary and sweet. Honestly  this place is doing barbacoa right. I went on a Sunday when I was hungover haha  and their melon cantaloupe agua fresca was everything. It was refreshing and hydrating and honestly it just made me feel good. All of the ingredients they use tasted so fresh and I can tell they really put so much thought and care about what they do. Michael was super helpful and he s funny lol.   I d do pick up if I were y all  there was only 2 tables and no shade  but trust me  this place is the real deal when it comes to barbacoa tacos  10 10
La Santa Barbacha,7,I m screaming from the rafters   YOU MUST EAT HERE        I had the chilaquiles bowl and almost cried. The attention to detail in every component of the food served at this family-run food truck  parked behind Native Hostel  is mind-blowing. They are DELIVERING on all fronts  my bowl was a perfect symphony of textures  flavors  and balance. I can t wait to go back and try the tortillas. I would buy a bottle of the salsa verde for real. Way to go  y all  And grab a coffee inside at Idlewild  it s delicious too 
La Santa Barbacha,8,Been wanting to try this new food truck and finally did last night. Was caught off guard when they told me their tacos were  5 EACH... WHAT   I ended up spending  7 on their Quesabarbacha which was great. But come on   5 for a taco  Maybe they re just double the size of a normal taco  but these are crazy prices for what is typically cheap Mexican food. I guess we re at Native Hostel so we re paying a premium. 5  if it was affordable enough for me to come back. Super friendly staff.
La Santa Barbacha,9,I came thinking it would be just another taco truck  but left with a new favorite spot   There are hundreds of taco places in Austin  but not many places that serve one of my favorite Mexican dishes - chilaquiles. So when I saw chilaquiles on their menu  I knew I had to get them  Their version is called the barbacha chilaquiles bowl. For the chilaquiles  which is the base of this bowl  corn tortillas are cut into strips  fried  then doused with tomatillo salsa. That s topped with chopped onion  sour cream  and queso fresco. The bowl also comes with refried pinto beans  barbacoa  slow cooked Angus beef   a fried sunny side up egg  sliced avocado  and cilantro. I loved everything about this bowl. The salsa was spicy in the best way  the barbacoa was super tender  the beans were seasoned perfectly  and the crispy egg was a nice addition to the bowl. It was so tasty I couldn t stop eating it  even after I knew I was full  yes  it s so filling  you get a lot of bang for your buck with this bowl  . They have free parking and a nice seating area outside  and they also have indoor seating with AC blasting.
La Santa Barbacha,10,We were excited to try their barbacoa tacos but the barbacoa beef was extremely dry and needed to be doused in sauce. My bf said the carne asada tacos were more palatable because of the guac  but this wasn t what we came here for. Definitely avoid their crispy cheese taco - it was unexpectedly huge  tasted very greasy  crispy and burnt  and wasn t cheesy in any way. We regret spending over  40 on these dry and burnt tacos and wouldn t come back.
La Santa Barbacha,11,The mint pineapple agua fresca was just the thing to beat the heat   But now the meat   The meat was a treat   Their barbacoa was a feat 
La Santa Barbacha,12,You can t find prices anywhere but on UberEats  went for lunch and both times we paid  the guy in charge kept making small talk and never said how much the total was. People behind us were ready to order and it was hot so I just wanted to go. I didn t realize it happened both times. The meal took a long time  about 55 minutes to 1 10 hours  but we didn t mind it was fresh and delicious. The only thing that bothers me is that they don t have prices on the menu and they don t even care to tell you how much you re paying each time.
La Santa Barbacha,13,I became a fan at the end of their old location tenure in south atx  the best tacos I ve had in austin  they are going to blow up in east atx  simple  beautifully composed barbacoa on homemade corn tortillas  also  unique and refreshing aguas frescas   created and run by a lovely family of siblings inspired by their father  highly recommended
La Santa Barbacha,14,Great Ft  Super friendly staff  we had the chilaquiles bowl and huevos rancheros bowl they were great  also we had an iced coffee and a mint and cucumber water to die for   The only thing missing is a couple more chairs lol other than that is pretty great 
La Santa Barbacha,15,Food was very tasty. Place was kinda quiet had a good time there. Beer was great with the tacos. Staff was very polite and food came out very quickly. Would definitely recommend people going here
La Santa Barbacha,16,This place is so over priced for no reason. We ordered 2 tacos  amp  2 aguas Fresca  amp  it came out to  42  The Barbacoa was so dry  amp  we got a LITTLE sprinkle of onion and cilantro.  The pineapple mint agua tasted like just blended mint with water
La Santa Barbacha,17,Great food. I had the barbacoa and the Benito. Both good. If you re feeling adventurous try the green and their habanero salsa.
La Santa Barbacha,18,Hands down  the best barbacoa in Austin.  You can get the barbacoa on some homemade corn tortillas. The tacos come with fresh salsa hot sauce on the side  but the flavor of the beef is perfect even without the sauces.  If you order the barbacoa chilaquiles  don t be surprised if you find yourself licking the bowl clean 
La Santa Barbacha,19,Predatory practices not posting prices on their menu at the truck. I got 5 tacos and 2 aguas frescas and it was 50 dollars. This makes the lack of posted prices even worse. The food was okay but their business practices are unacceptable.
La Santa Barbacha,20,First of all this is not the current location of La Santa Barbacha  they are located on East 3rd and I 35 behind the Native hostel. Delicious food and fresh drinks and friendly service. Delicious perfection. Do yourself a favor 
La Santa Barbacha,21,Doesn t look like much when you pass by  but I truly stumbled across a new Gem in ATX     La Santa had the finest quick fix selections of what I would call authentic Mexican   Street Cuisine        With a specialty in  barbacoa  but some fusions of classic Mexican dishes and entres as well. You will surely love the experience with the Santa sisters      They are awesome and provide the best friendly  and warm welcoming service like a home cooked meal     See you again soon La Santa    
La Santa Barbacha,22,Delicious tacos and aqua fresca. Very friendly staff. One thing that could be improved is the very limited seating available  2 tables 
La Santa Barbacha,23,So glad i was shown this new hidden gem. The food and the staff are freaking phenomenal . Stopped by for brunch and had the Migas bowl with barbacoa that was simply delicious      for dessert a slice of Cake that must ve been made by Cake Jesus himself . I highly recommend this place and  I look forward to going back very soon.
La Santa Barbacha,24,10 10  The potatoes barbacoa taco and chilaquiles bowl were amazing. Food came out quick too
La Santa Barbacha,25,The food is delicious aguas frescas are fresh the service is top notch  Strongly recommended
La Santa Barbacha,26,Some of the best tacos I ve ever had   And a very affordable place to have a great meal  Customer service was wonderful  fresh made tortillas and delicious salsas  Will be coming back here again and again
Kings Taqueria Y Mas,1,Let me start by saying I work less than a mile away  and I probably stumbled upon this place on Yelp - SO glad I did a couple years ago. The tacos from this vibrant green truck in a fairly desolate trailer park on S Congress has been a staple in my professional diet because the food is bomb and the prices are more than fair. Never move away King s tacos  NEVER     My go-to is a steak quesadilla  which is rather large for 6   always fresh and always delicious. I also love the steak tacos on corn  con todo   onions   cilantro   ALWAYS grab the limes  and their verde sauce is a must. All of those components I just listed make this taco impassable at this price point.  Service is always friendly and fast  You can even call in your order ahead of time so it s ready by the time you get there.  Give this place a try  you will not be disappointed  
Kings Taqueria Y Mas,2,This place is a solid stop for good quick Mexican food  I walked over today to grab a chicken quesadilla and a few Barbacoa tacos. The service was excellent  there was some seating and music playing while waiting  amp  the food came super quick  only took about 6 minutes. You can tell they receive a lot of orders via apps for delivery pickup and had a good system in place to cook them all up fresh  amp  fast. The chicken quesadilla was massive  like a solid 1lb    full of cheese  handfuls of chicken and came with sour cream plus added avocado slices - Totally worth  6 bucks   The Barbacoa was pretty good as well  a little fatty but still solid flavor. I will definitely go back for another quesadilla and to try the tortas and breakfast tacos  
Kings Taqueria Y Mas,3,I only wish they had longer hours  but it s the perfect breakfast lunch stop. Their chicken  barbacoa  and al pastor are so savory and delicious  They are also so friendly and welcoming  I always enjoy coming to Kings.
Kings Taqueria Y Mas,4,Decided I needed to get some breakfast after running some errands in the morning. I parked in the back lot at about 9 50am and walked into the empty food park. The lot looked like it needed some landscaping. King s was a bright green food truck and was the only food truck that had a few people there.  Looking at the menu they didn t have much choices  but had enough. The prices were pretty cheap too. The woman at explained to me that each breakfast taco had one ingredient and you could add another for more money. I ended up ordering a egg and bacon  egg and chorizo  and a soft tripas on flour.  After about 5 to 10 mins the food came. The eggs felt like they were a little overcooked  but the tacos were still good. Tasted like home cooked food. The tripas was amazing and I could savor the meat taste. I ll definitely come back and try the other meat items another time. If you are in the area and want some good tacos  this is the place.
Kings Taqueria Y Mas,5,The tacos at Kings were soooo good    You have to get some for you and your family    They were fast  and my order was made to perfection    Thanks   
Kings Taqueria Y Mas,6,This place has always been good. I d go to this food truck at least once a week for their breakfast tacos. Their burrito bowls are the best bang for the buck. I recommend the pastor quesadillas  and chicken fajita tacos. Got a nice sitting area for lunch times as well.
Kings Taqueria Y Mas,7,I was super hungry and I saw this place. I order some tacos  they were the best tacos I had in a while. Also there sala was A1  had the right amount of spice in it. Would definitely order here again
Kings Taqueria Y Mas,8,Super fair prices  great quality  quick and friendly service. I ve been spreading the word on how good this place is. I hope they one day get a restaurant or just stay available after possible construction on their current location. Best street tacos in Austin
Kings Taqueria Y Mas,9,King s Tacos had generous delicious portions for a good price.   I got the torta and barbacoa quesadilla. Both were larger than I expected and fantastic. This is a solid food truck in a short-wait area. If you re near the area check it out   Friendly service  good food  great portions  excellent prices
Kings Taqueria Y Mas,10,The al pastor was really amazing. The chicken fajita was meh  a little dry  but the barbacoa  tripas  amazing  and pastor more than made up for it. Can t wait to eat here again.
BIG Franks Taco Food Truck,1,Excellent Service and Food is amazing   Big Frank s Tacos Truck came to our office for all -hands employee meeting.  Everyone loved the variety of choices.    They move the line fast and everyone gave great compliments to the chef and servers. We will definitely be calling again.
BIG Franks Taco Food Truck,2,Unpleasant experience today at this truck. First of all the beef was very chewy  gristly  and low quality cut  in a bad way . They didnt take the time to melt the grated cheese like so many other trucks do.  The tortillas def tasted store bought and not even warmed. So many other taco trucks these days take the pride to make and warm their tortillas.  Tacos were 3 stars.   But the customer service was horrendous  The owner made a mistake at a prepaid event and would not serve my daughter.  When I inquired  albeit in a relatively negative way as I was upset how she was treated  instead of making it right and defusing my anger  the owner got in my face  got angrier  and caused a scene. This is not the way to be successful in any customer oriented business...especially at an event where the host is treating their guests and as there are often errors on the guest list like today.
BIG Franks Taco Food Truck,3,Big Frank s came out to my neighborhood so we thought we d support the local business and let me tell you we were not prepared for the food mountain that was delivered upon us. We ordered the chorizo taco  the footlong hotdog which was loaded with everything under the sun  and the nacho fries with beef. We also got a free churro that had a vein of butter in it.   Pros  you will not be hungry when you are done with this food. It s giant and delicious. The chorizo was the perfect amount of spice. We didn t get a picture before eating it all  The hotdog was wrapped in bacon and covered in so much goodness I don t know how we managed to finish it all  The churro was the best dang churro I ve ever eaten  Super friendly folks running the truck    Cons  I don t have anything negative to say
BIG Franks Taco Food Truck,4,Food was meh. Spent too much on it. Boyfriends California burrito was better than my nachos. Food was barely seasoned.
BIG Franks Taco Food Truck,5,The food truck came to my neighborhood  and I am so glad I gave it a whirl  I got the street tacos  and the only thing I could say is I wanted more salsa  There was an orange  that I m thinking is habanero   and green that was jalape o . I d love to know what flavors those are  I didn t get a great photo because it was too good  Can t wait until they come back to our hood 
BIG Franks Taco Food Truck,6,Texas just experienced the coldest winter since 1949.  Our neighborhood lost water and power 3-7 days with temps between 5-34 degrees.  It s been difficult to get food due to low inventory and lines a mile long.   We live in a great neighborhood where we have food trucks during the year.  Today Big Frank came to our neighborhood to feed folks low on food.  We got Big Frank s  La Suegra  Migas and breakfast tacos. Everything was delicious   They were small tacos but surprisingly filling 
BIG Franks Taco Food Truck,7,Had a tast of Big Franks tacos today at a work event. Food was great  service was great.   
BIG Franks Taco Food Truck,8,Absolutely delicious tacos  I highly recommend the La Cuca taco the shrimp is delicious.
BIG Franks Taco Food Truck,9,Before I dive into my mini review  I gotta say that Big Frank s Tacos definitely stays true to the name  These tacos are fat and thicc   I  went ahead and ordered the  Big Frank s Taco  AND I LOVED IT  It was a nice mix of pastor and bistec meat and it was accompanied with a delicious red and green salsa.  My boyfriend ordered the carnitas tacos  and never uttered a word while we ate  so I m guessing it was a darn good taco too.   My one regret is that I didn t order a second big Frank taco or get a picture for the Yelp page  BUT I hope that s enough proof to let everyone know it was great   Thanks stopping at our apartment to feed us 
BIG Franks Taco Food Truck,10,Their food truck was outside of 12 Fox Beer Co and let me tell you the chicken quesadilla is da bomb. I split it with someone and it was still more than enough food and the spice was on point. Our other friends split the veggie quesadilla and were just as satisfied. Definitely looking forward to trying more of their food.   PS they let you pick what goes into the veggie quesadilla and don t charge extra Get the mushrooms for sure .
BIG Franks Taco Food Truck,11,Best burrito in texas.  Carne asada fries are amazing.
BIG Franks Taco Food Truck,12,MY FAVORITE food truck    I ve found them several times  they re mobile  and haven t been disappointed yet   
BIG Franks Taco Food Truck,13,Absolutely amazing tacos. I got the breakfast tacos and they were to die for. Went back for seconds. Highly recommend. The customer service is amazing as well 
BIG Franks Taco Food Truck,14,Best Asada Fries and everything else is good as well    My first time trying Asada fries and OMG so delicious  and fresh  the owner puts everything fresh  meat done as you order and he is so nice he also does Catering and is called BIG Frank s Catering check them out.
BIG Franks Taco Food Truck,15,Wow   What a surprise .. showed up at Dell Seton Medical Center  UT on a cold night .. nice hot fresh food     These guys are awesome     
BIG Franks Taco Food Truck,16,I had the Big Frank s Taco and La Suegra taco  both were absolutely delicious  fast and friendly service  Best tacos I ve had since Covid started  if their truck is nearby definitely give it a shot 
BIG Franks Taco Food Truck,17,Big Frank s has delighted us a couple of times with their various trucks. We first tried his taco truck and was floored by the portions and flavor  Next  we tried his burger truck and were equally pleased with the food offerings. I would recommend Big Frank s to anyone looking for a food truck. He is easy to work with and can serve large crowds.
BIG Franks Taco Food Truck,18,YUMMMMMMY  Wow this is some good food  Came to 12 Fox and ordered several options and everything was on point  Will definitely eat it again 
BIG Franks Taco Food Truck,19,Big franks came to my apartment complex about a weeks go and I m still waiting on them to come back. The tacos were fire and the hot dog was delicious
BIG Franks Taco Food Truck,20,Big Frank s Taco Food Truck serviced our community with delicious food today. The food was amazing  the service was great. We truly appreciate having Big Frank s. Looking forward to the next visit.
El Tacorrido,1,Good solid choice  We get the veggies versions but one also had the chicken quesadilla  amp  carnitas tacos.  Always good  amp I like their salsas amp guacamole.  Drive thru makes it easy but I also live near sowe walk  amp  order inside too.   3 large picnic tables outside  amp  several small tables inside.   Friendly staff 
El Tacorrido,2,I ve been here a couple times so I can safely say this place is 2-stars.  It s got a neat and tight eating area  and a drive-thru that is open until midnight. I d definitely say this place is trying to be like a fast food chain that has more classical Mexican tastes.  But the meat is always dry. So dry. Even with using one lime slice per taco  and 0.5 oz of salsa  the tacos still try and choke you with their lack of moisture. That salsa  by the way  is 30 cents per 1 oz if you want more. Huge red flag there to me because I think a good salsa is integral to a good taco and thus should be included in the price. Someone else pointed out their 1 taco   1 salsa  2 tacos   1 salsa logic. These tacos definitely need the full 1 oz of salsa each.  My salsa on my latest trip at least definitely lacked salt. A first for me as far as restaurants go. The tacos  however  may have been technically small  but boy were they packed with meat. For  2.75  I think you re getting a nice amount of meat so kudos to that. If you can handle dryness and paying for salsa  then I d say this place is for you.  Al Pastor - Good enough. Tastes like your typical non-trompo al pastor. Carnitas - Typically these tacos tend to be dry so I kept that in mind  but this manages to be dryer than other carnitas. Good flavor though. Habanero Chicken - I love habanero  but this wasn t doing it for me. Tasted a bit like HEB s pre-marinated chicken. Chips and Queso Blanco - You just get a tub of not-even-fully-melted cheese that is served cold. Wonderful  Peppers  Nah. Cilantro  No way. Maybe a tomato or onion  Forgetttt it. Queso literally means cheese  yes  but the connotation is usually a bit more involved. Chips were good thick chips.  This sucks because the flavors of most of the meats are pretty good  but they tasted like they were cooked couple days ago and just reheated  whilst the queso was just left out at room temperature.
El Tacorrido,3,Get all 3 Salsas... even if they charge you.   Had the beef and chicken tacos and all of them were amazing   Corn all the way.
El Tacorrido,4,Omg good. I went for lunch and them came back the next day for breakfast. The horchata coffee is what dreams are made of.
El Tacorrido,5,Come for the veggie tacos  stay for the green sauce. So yeah  the carnitas whatnot tacos are kinda dry. You  could  drown them in the  remarkably awesome  green sauce  but  otoh  you could get the various veggie tacos which are  legit  
El Tacorrido,6,This place is amazing. Drive thru is insane too. But man they got some good food  Watch out in this neighborhood.
El Tacorrido,7,Good food. Fast service. Breakfast tacos are really good   Along with horchata and Al pastor tacos  
El Tacorrido,8,Update  the verdura tacos are likely the best vegetarian tacos in Austin. The sauce and flavors are outstanding  Love many of their other tacos too. One of the top spots and under the radar for now.
El Tacorrido,9,Not from Austin but will say these tacos very dry   fajita looked and tasted like ground beef. The second tortilla of corn was not cooked all the way . Maybe next time   for now two stars.
El Tacorrido,10,Breakfast tacos were top notch  Quick service  fair priced  and delicious salsas  Had two breakfast tacos with bacon  and two with chorizo.. honestly favored the bacon.
El Tacorrido,11,Cheap Mexican food in Austin which surprisingly is hard to come by. I thought it was decent  Nothing crazy but it s enough to satisfy a craving. They also have menudo and pozole on the weekends. Very convenient to just drive through and grab some tacos on a busy day. Freshly made food which is nice. Will definitely go back when I don t feel like standing in line for Rositas.
El Tacorrido,12,Still insanely slow drive thru  but gave it another go recently and the food was much better. Got the horchata iced latte and it was fantastic  and the breakfast tacos did the trick. Still wish the drive thru woes would be fixed - but at least the food improved and no burnt tortillas 
El Tacorrido,13,Decided to come here on a whim  after we recognized it from a city guide book. The taco de pescado was so good  as were the others  a la carte pollo taco on flour was 2nd favorite . Tried the A La Carte Taco Al Pastor  and could do without- neither good or bad.   The salsas are great  the chips with the salsa .  And loved that we could get a frozen mango margarita through a drive thru window- which to our surprise was SO GOOD.   Best part  all super affordable.
El Tacorrido,14,Popped in here on the fly after planning to go somewhere else farther up the road but this spot is adorable so it caught our eye. It s a drive thru but small inside order at the counter kinda spot. Has a nice patio but we decided to sit inside. Music was SO LOUD and it wasn t super clean but good enough so we stuck it out. Ordered breakfast tacos and were quickly served. Tacos were pretty good. Being a true Texan I have had better haha but I would eat these again for sure. Fast in and out and we hit the road back to DFW happy and ohhhh with a LATTE  Finding a taco and latte spot is so rare that this coffee lover added a star.
El Tacorrido,15,The BEST breakfast tacos ever  I always am diving right in to eat these amazing tacos that I never take a pic. I chair this multiple times a week and this is a must for my dad when he visits from out of town.
El Tacorrido,16,Great  quick place to get tacos. Since they opened  we have frequented this location  and I m always impressed with the quality and consistency of the food. This location is better than the location closer to me on South 1st. I love the Migas plate   Unfortunately  they do consistently miss items or get an order wrong.
El Tacorrido,17,Went through the drive thru for an easy and delicious breakfast and that is what I got  The migas came with red and green sauce both super tasty. The migas themselves were so good and topped with cheese that was perfectly melted. The horchata was flavorful  definitely want to go back 
El Tacorrido,18,I stopped here for my first culinary experience in Austin after leaving the airport before check-in at my hotel.  They have a drive-thru  and they also serve breakfast tacos all day  which seems to be a staple here in Austin.  The food was amazing  fresh  delicious  and full of flavor.  The pollo tacos were so authentic.  They have a pretty extensive menu.  They are close to downtown and South Congress hotels  and the have a private parking lot with plenty of parking.  Bravo  and thank you 
El Tacorrido,19,Great dine-in for tacos  tasty red and green salsas  guacamole  and thicker salty tortilla chips.
El Tacorrido,20,Ordered two veggie mushroom tacos on flour and received them both on corn. No limes were included which was disappointing. Flavor wasn t great. Still a fan of Taccorido  just not this location. Burnet location is way better. Check your order before you drive off  Won t be going back to this location.
El Tacorrido,21,I ve been going to El Taccorrido for years and years at the S. 1st location. Was always my go-to and was excited to see it open on Riverside. Taste is still good my only complaint is how skimped our everything is vs what used to be served at the other location.  It s sad you open your taco and that taco you can eat in two bites because you can roll it into a flauta bc of how empty it is. I ve gone a few times maybe 3-4 to give benefit of the doubt but I think this will not change. The convenience of drive through is nice  that s it.  I then went to the white food truck directly in front of the gas station next to Tacorrido. Not sure what it s called  but her tacos are 1.50-1.75   homemade corn tortillas  and FAT. They re delicious. Worth getting off to order    FYI
El Tacorrido,22,These are probably the most authentic street tacos that I ve had since coming to Austin. All the standard meat tacos run  2.50 which is about what a taco should be.  The guac was good  amp  came preseasoned correctly. The chips were decent  but could ve used a touch more in the fryer.  Michelada was just ok. Nothing special.  I ll be back for more as I really am on the lookout for a decent grilled fish taco in Austin.
El Tacorrido,23,Don t listen to the haters that have underrated this place  The food here is solid and pretty authentic for a drive-thru joint. It s always quick and consistent.   Our faves  carnitas  pescado  and bistec tacos  the equinox  horchata   espresso  YES    and their guac. None of the above will disappoint 
El Tacorrido,24,Best drive through tacos in Austin and great vegetarian options.  If you re not in the mood for tacos  try a torta - the bread is delicious.  I love this place more than about any other restaurant in Austin.
El Tacorrido,25,I love El Tacorrido  I was pumped when I saw they were opening one by my house.  They have great food  great service  and great prices.  I am a big fan of the all their tacos. It is very vegetarian and gluten free friendly.  The chips and guacamole are delicious also. My wife s favorite Taco is TACO DE VERDURAS.  Once they open the dining room  I can t wait to try the frozen margaritas.
El Tacorrido,26,tonight was my first time visiting this restaurant. I heard nothing but good things about this place. I wanted to feed my two teenage boys so all we ordered was one breakfast taco and one chips with queso. We were the only ones there at the time  yet we waited half an hour without seeing our food. Two more tables came in and were served before us. One employee told us they don t know where our order was. I asked for a refund and left. Not a great first impression. I am not motivated to return anytime soon.
El Tacorrido,27,This place used to be my favorite al pastor in town and for my birthday this past March we had some friends over and my wife ordered 100 tacos. Nothing was labeled and tacos were crammed into boxes so to grab a taco you inevitably touched someone else s to find out what the hell kind of taco it was  just so dumb. They ve also always been SO tight with their salsas but the last two times we went put us over the edge. We went thru the drive thru and ordered 6 tacos. She asked what kind of salsa we wanted so i prefaced with  Ok 6 tacos  six salsas  so we d like three verde and three molcajete thanks   - Drove up and we were charged for two extra salsas. I asked why and the guy said  it s one for two  I said does that mean if i order one taco you don t get a salsa  He replied no  if you order one taco you get one salsa if you order two tacos you get one salsa. I asked how does that make any sense  What if its six people going their separate ways and want their own salsa  I got a blank stare. I m thinking this is a classic Larry David Curb Your Enthusiasm episode where he drives through the line 6 separate times in circles and orders one taco each time out of principle. On top of that we get home and WE ONLY HAVE 4 SALSAS FOR 6 TACOS OH THE HORROR. But seriously  charged extra and didn t even get what we paid for. I wrote them privately and got no response so here is your public review El Tacorrido. You have lost our business over nickles and dimes and I will no longer recommend your fleecing ways. Adios 
El Tacorrido,28,Make sure you repeat your order  to them 5 times. Think they have a hard time getting it right. Maybe their headphones are broken or something. The other location you talk to a person and for some reason is more accurate then the new one.
El Tacorrido,29,Love that there s a drive thru  Gorditas are delicious  as are the tacos. Kind of a tricky entrance to get to from westbound Riverside. Quick service too 
El Tacorrido,30,Taccorido is an authentic and delicious stop in ATX. The original location is tiny and I m so happy they built the larger store - the taco de veduras  vegetarian  are AMAZING or the al pastor is always flawless. The green sauce they make is the perfect touch  and the prices are insanely reasonable  you have to try it
El Tacorrido,31,Came here 4-5 times per week for a few weeks for breakfast. Always tipped 2-3 dollars per order. Trying to support a small business.   Then came here for dinner and was treated like an asshole for asking for two types of meat on a quesadilla. They disappeared into the back for 10 minutes to make my tiny order of food and then I was told   We don t make the rules.    I won t be back.
El Tacorrido,32,Great food and service  Seriously  the staff and manager here are so sweet and genuine  Either drive thru or sitting down for a quick bite  this spot is perfffffff 
El Tacorrido,33,Pretty dang delicious. Just tried it for the first time - ordered the al pastor taco  the carnitas taco and the al pastor quesadilla. All three were extremely flavorful  the tortillas perfectly warmed up  and the hot sauces were fresh and tasty. Only reason I m giving the 4 5 rating is because of the price is a little high and the fact that the hot sauces cost extra. I also imagined the quesadilla would come with a side of guacamole or sour cream  as most places do this   but you need to order it on the side for extra. But that s okay  Just not the greatest when you re eating out on a budget  like myself. All in all  I m pretty impressed. The service was good  fast  and they appeared to be following safe COVID protocols.
El Tacorrido,34,The food is always very fresh regardless of what time you go. I usually get the Migas for breakfast and not only is the food very good  but so are the prices. AND..... not only is the food and prices good  but the customer service is even better  Also love how they re opened until 12pm for a late night snack 
El Tacorrido,35,The food is delicious but I rarely don t have issues with the order. The most recent time we ordered three breakfast tacos and a torta. The receipt was correct on the bag. But when we got home there were two tacos and chips with guacamole.  This has happened multiple times and they need to figure it out   Upgrading to three stars because they are super friendly and the food is that good. Plus they gave us free chips and queso for the mix up. Just fix the weird ordering glitches 
El Tacorrido,36,I ve been back to this place  and while my boyfriend loves it  it seems to me like their meat tends to be dry. Unless it s one of the tacos where the meat is marinated or in a sauce on the menu  it s dry and unflavorful. The carnitas and pollo tacos come off bland and dry without having to add salsa to them.
El Tacorrido,37,Tried this spot for the first time. I ordered ceviche   queso  and al pastor taco. The ceviche has a long black hair in it  they forgot the queso  and I got a carne Asada taco instead of al pastor. The food I did get was just okay - the chips were the best part. I will not be going back.
El Tacorrido,38,I went to this restaurant looking for the best Gordita in Austin. Little did I know that my hope would come crashing down as I took a bite of what tasted like a frisbee with a hint of barbacoa. Now as I lay in bed with disappointment  my spirits are shaken. However  my journey continues. The best Gordita in Austin is out there somewhere  but it is not here.
El Tacorrido,39,Great place for breakfast tacos   We had that potatoe egg  amp  cheese  chorizo egg  amp  cheese   and a beef torta de bistec.  All really good.   great service.
El Tacorrido,40,This place is fire  try the carnitas Taco  with the green salsa. The quesadilla is really good too  and big for  5. Green salsa here is the best
El Tacorrido,41,I LOVE this place. My boyfriend and I stop here several times a week for carne guisada tacos  al pastor  and or breakfast tacos. Service is always friendly. I m not a huge fan of their chicken nor their chips   queso  but the carne guisada is SO delicious that the  misses  here seem minimal 
El Tacorrido,42,The food is pretty good  but my only issues were that we ordered and when we got to the pay window  had to order again because the cashier didn t write it down. The other issue was there was no salsa for the tacos.  They were kind of bland and greasy.
El Tacorrido,43,I come here often and usually the tacos are decent and most of the time my order is correct. As of lately my food has been cold and my tacos have been incorrect and I don t order complicated things. I m giving them 3 stars because they used to be a lot better  but I m one of those people where if my order is wrong and the food isn t I get annoyed because I m usually hangry and I ll find a different spot.
El Tacorrido,44,I love this place.  The drive Thru makes it so easy to get yummy tacos.  My favorites are the bacon and egg and potato and egg in the morning.
El Tacorrido,45,I never right reviews but el tocorrido is my new favorite spot. Great tacos  cheap  convenient. Can t ask for much more than that 
Zombie Taco,1,The brisket tacquitos are incredible. So crispy. Good portion of thick  real meat and gooey delicious cheese. A bit pricey for the portion but the avocado salsa verde makes it worth it. Sooo good  Perfect late night snack.
Zombie Taco,2,They are open 24 7   Need I say anymore   When looking for some late night eats on a weeknight  it can be harder to find something that s not fast food. And then comes Zombie Taco  They hit the spot and were a solid taco and burrito. The queso is just a small cup of melted cheese  not the best but was decent to eat with the amazing tortilla chips they have to just hit the spot after my taco. The baja shrimp and brisket tacos were great  My husband got the burrito and was content as well. Not the most amazing taco I ve ever had  but definitely really good for the total package of price and availability 
Zombie Taco,3,This is like some Portland hippie s fever-dream imagination of a taco. Everything about the flavor and texture profile of these tacos is. Just. Wrong. It s not a creative re-imagining of a taco  it s actually just so off-base as to be simply incorrect.  The brisket tacos I just had were instantly confusingly sweet- liquid is dripping everywhere  which can be a good thing  but here just served to make  not  enjoying this taco more difficult . There s no fresh veg  no crunch of fresh onions  no notes of caramelization from anything  no acidity. And all this is wrapped up in a corn tortilla that is far too thick   rigid. You especially know it s too thick and rigid  because they only had to use one to hold this drippy brisket taco together instead of two.  Their queso is no bueno as stated in my previous review.
Zombie Taco,4,It s fine but overpriced. There are plenty of better tacos for less than  5 apiece in the area. Drinks are  3 and it s in a hotel lobby.
Zombie Taco,5,What a great surprise to have this yummy taco shop in the lobby of my hotel  Moxy  I hadn t stayed at Moxy before and was pleasantly surprised to see this 24 7 meal option literally in the lobby. The prices on the menu were super affordable  so I assumed it was too good to be true  but gave it a try anyway. The only thing I ordered that I didn t quite care for was the queso  but the taco trio  chips  salsa  and guac were all SOLID. I would 100  eat here again  especially if I stay at Moxy again in the future.
Zombie Taco,6,This is the review you get when you advertise as being 24 hours and then don t answer your phone. Terrible service. Get out of here.
Zombie Taco,7,24 hour tacos located in the lobby of your hotel  Yes please   Highly recommend the 3 tacos for  10 special  otherwise  4 each . Tacos are on the smaller side but super flavorful and each is so different.  We ordered the thick cut jalape o bacon  braised brisket  charred Korean steak  and pork carnita   Fave was probably the brisket.   Order at counter and pick up at counter. If you don t want to enter hotel  you can order to go at the window on Guadalupe Street - brilliant concept   Did I mention the taco bar is next to Bar Moxy in the lobby   Win Win  
Zombie Taco,8,Service was terrible    I don t like cheese and asked if they can just leave off the cheese for the burrito and taco I ordered.  The girl says   I won t do modifications cause we re busy right now .  Umm....ok   It s going to take you that much to not put cheese on something   In an age where businesses complain about lack of workers or customers being impatient  as a consumer I m tired of workers that give you attitude to do simple tasks.
Zombie Taco,9,Maybe I was too hungry.  I think it s the best taco I have ever had.  Ordered brisket  Baju and bacon. So flavorful.  Moreover it s convenient. 24 7. Located at the lobby of my hotel. Quite budget friendly 
Zombie Taco,10,Was staying at the Moxy and HAD TO try this spot out since it was 24 hours.   Everything was worth it. Friendly service was a plus as well.  Can t wait to have more when checked back into the Moxy.
Zombie Taco,11,Stopped by on a Wednesday morning at 8am -- thank goodness this place is so close to campus and open 24 7. I got their American  breakfast burrito . I don t usually eat burritos because it s too much food  but I just went for it because the ingredients  sausage  bacon  hash brown  scrambled eggs  sharp cheddar  jalape o salsa  sounded so good...I was right  I got a huge tasty burrito for  9.
Zombie Taco,12,We arrived very late night and this place is in the lobby of the moxy hotel and was 24 hours- dude the BEST tacos they do not scrimp on the ingredients tons of guacamole nice fresh peppers we loved it. We sat at the moxy bar highly recommend the Don Johnson   watermelon and cucumber infused vodka  if you re like us and accidentally have a flight arrive after everything closes you will be well served and fed
Zombie Taco,13,I am a foodie  and I love tacos. They are my thing. After eating here  which was completely random cuz Kirby Lane Cafe decided to have stupid Covid hours  I fell in love. I am hard pressed to think of a taco that beats these tacos. I had one of each of the three available meet options  chicken  pork  and beef . I love all three and even split a second order cuz I wanted to indulge in the flavors once more. NGL   was so tempted to split a third order. So good. You owe it to yourself to try them. New fav.
Zombie Taco,14,Excellent food and a fun atmosphere. If you re a party animal  this place is open 24 hours. The zombie burrito was huge and totally delicious. A non-traditional burrito with both chicken and pork--the coleslaw gave it the perfect crunch  We are staying a couple nights here at the Moxy Hotel  where it s located  so this place is an added bonus. Come try it even if you aren t staying 
Zombie Taco,15,Seamless order and pick-up process  I absolutely love their branding  and the Baja fish taco that I had was very delicious. I ve passed by this place a few times  and am glad I finally got to try it  Will definitely go again  as it is open 24 hours and near campus.
Zombie Taco,16,Great for a late night craving after spending some time at the Moxy bar. Only okay and too expensive during the day time. The kiosk ordering and pick-up window is very convenient though.
Zombie Taco,17,Super trendy and service was nice. I also love that they had tablets outside so you can order ahead. wish they had pictures of their food though. definitely love that they re open 24 hours. helps when you re cramming in a late night study session.
Zombie Taco,18,I got a snack of chips  amp  guac after a late night out- it was delicious and reasonably priced. My friends got tacos and said the Pork Carnita wasn t very good  but the Grilled Adobo BBQ Chicken was super yummy. A great place to grab some late night snacks after hitting up some bars 
Zombie Taco,19,Went in the middle of the night w some friends. Zombie burrito was rlly good  and the screen ordering was super convenient. Pretty sure the guy lied to us abt being out of Banana pudding tho   
Zombie Taco,20,Ordered from here off Uber eats at about 1130pm and had increasing wait times until 3am. Cancelled the order  but was charged since it wasn t within 5 min of the order  how would anyone know to cancel that quick . Anyways  I never received the food so cannot comment on it  but feel like 2  hours of wait time and never receiving food and still proceeding to charge me is pretty scammy. I know this is probably a disconnect with Uber eats and this business  but fair warning to avoid the combo team. I would score lower  but since I never received the food I guess it could still be good.
Zombie Taco,21,I m from out of town but every time I visit Austin this place is a Must Have    they are open 24 7 and their tacos are the absolute best   Really hoping for an expansion soon all around Texas because this place is amazing  
Zombie Taco,22,Ordered the lunch combo  3 for  10  and the tacos were fantastic. I had the Baja shrimp  which was my favorite  the brisket and the quinoa cauliflower. I d definitely order the brisket and shrimp again. Also get the churros    Service was super fast and friendly 
Zombie Taco,23,HORRIBLE  I ordered the  brisket  taquitos and the  green chile  queso. The mystery meat in the taquitos was big choking hazard size chunks of fatty gristle. The queso would not have spilled if I held the cup upside down and it had no flavor  nothing to make me believe that it was anything other than plain velveeta. I m giving 1 star as benefit of the doubt that the rest of the menu is not as bad  though I won t be back to try it. I m giving 1 star for the easy 15 minute parking on the side of the building  even in the middle of the day.
Zombie Taco,24,Brisket tacos were cold  very greasy  flavorless and disgusting.  Should have gone to the 7-11 instead.
Zombie Taco,25,Super quick service and pretty easy to order and pick up.tasted really good as well got the 3 for  10 brunch tacos and 1 zombie burrito for 22 .
Zombie Taco,26,Not 24 hours. Went around 2pm on a Monday  Moxy hotel bartenders informed me that the restaurant doesn t open until 4pm. A week later I called to find out exact hours... no voicemail stating the business name and no call back. May be due to shortage of employees  but at least update your website and social medias if no longer 24 hr hours have changed...
Zombie Taco,27,The guy working handout is completely braindead  he only noticed us when throwing out some bug with his bare hands
Zombie Taco,28,Had breakfast.  Really good.  Ordered 2 different breakfast tacos and a burrito.  Done
Zombie Taco,29,Zombie Taco is an excellent little taco stop  I m staying at the Moxy and loved that this restaurant is a 24 7 amenity during our stay. We decided to give their breakfast a try and WOW  It did not disappoint  My partner and I both had the Chicken Chorizo and Egg Whites  amp  Avocado Tacos and seriously enjoyed them both. The fresh tomatillo salsa really brought everything together  The tortillas are sturdy  great for holding all of the delicious goods inside  We are both pretty picky when it comes to tacos  so this place really impressed us. They make ordering super easy too by using a tablet  then they text you when your order is ready  Very streamline and quick. Definitely recommend Zombie Taco   Took some photos too because the people need to know 
Zombie Taco,30,A little expensive  but very tasty   Probably the ONLY late night option in Austin   I recommend the burrito.
Zombie Taco,31,Really great considering it s open 24 hours. Excellent place to end the evening after a night of drinking  with a bar conveniently right next door.
Zombie Taco,32,Complete surprise as to the quality of these tacos. Will definitely be back. I had the fish taco and the bacon one. So delicious. Was a bit strange to have no one manning the counter  but the decor of the hotel and experience were delightful.
Zombie Taco,33,Ordered the Thick Cut Jalapeno Bacon and the Charred Korean Steak. The Jalapeno Bacon was pretty good  since the bacon was had a nice texture to it and the ranch complimented with the other ingredients. The Charred Korean Steak  on the other hand  was a bit of a miss for me since I am Korean and I expected it to be spicier. It was definitely savory though and would be fine if you don t have a bias for Korean food.  All in all will definitely try it out again to see how the other items are.
Zombie Taco,34,Queso was like the stuff you get at a baseball game. Fake and flavorless. Nacho cheese sauce. I ordered the cheesy brisket taquitos as well. The meat in them was tough and extremely fatty. I didn t see any cheese in them either. I do not recommend  you will be disappointed.
Zombie Taco,35,Most over priced tacos in Austin. They do taste good but for  5 each at the size  quality  and quantity you get  I d say don t go for it. I assume it s a hotel mark up but they re are middle tier taco at best for a very very high end price
Zombie Taco,36,Pretty good food but definitely not worth 8 dollars for 2 tacos feels a bit over priced but overall is good if you re okay with spending
Zombie Taco,37,These tacos are so nummy   The atmosphere is chill and  the service was quick and friendly.  Highly recommend 
Zombie Taco,38,I ate here three nights in a row when staying at the Moxy  haha...love that s it s 24 7 and the tacos were great  I tried pretty much all of them and they were FIRE  plus the cheese dip is great too. The food was ready in 5 minutes and they texted me when it was done. Great customer experience

Zombie Taco,40,I have ordered here several times  it is always delicious. Zombies has quickly become the go-to in our household.
Zombie Taco,41,Had a take out order from the outside kiosk. Ordered the brisket taco  taquitos  and chips and dip. Everything was delicious  Fresh Guac and fresh salsa were a hit 
Zombie Taco,42,great nachos. great tacos. one of the better late night spots. always open. what more can you ask for 
Zombie Taco,43,Had some very good  homey feeling food. Would definitely recommend. They also had a lot of vegan and vegetarian options.
