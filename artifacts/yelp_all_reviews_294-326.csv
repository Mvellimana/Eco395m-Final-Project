Bomb Tacos,1,everyone acting like they re expecting an otherworldly gastronomic experience from a small shop selling street tacos in the wee hours when almost everything else is closed  and the emperors lights is no longer upon us  need to chillllll.  their mini street tacos hit the spot every time  and what you see is what you get. they may bot blow you away  but the tortillas are petty good  and that mest aint nothing to shake a stick at.   the nachos are a bit of a mess  but c est la vie - beggers cant be choosers when its 2am and you need 4th meal in order to not completely write off responsibilities the next morning.
Bomb Tacos,2,In the top 5 of Austin taco joints.. I can t get enough. The thing I love is the flavor at Bomb Taco.. it all tastes good to the last bite. I am going to proclaim that the Hawaiian Taco on the menu is one of the best bites in the city.... Absolutely fantastic array of fresh flavor. The Hawaiian is packed with soy sauce marinated chicken  pineapple  lettuce  Pico  cheese..... omg.. take me back now. The flavor from this truck is awesome. It s been around a long time all over town and I am a buyer anytime I m in the area. Get Bombed
Bomb Tacos,3,If you happen to be out and about and find yourself at the White Horse in the late night chances are you might be hungry. Luckily Bomb Tacos is right there on the patio to serve your drunken hunger needs. I got the pork tacos and cheese fries. It was messy  but it hit the spot after a night of drinking with friends. The cheese fries are pretty big and definitely something to share. I wouldn t seek out this place probably  but I would eat here again if I find myself at the White Horse hungry at 1am.
Bomb Tacos,4,Best campechana in town.  This food truck is located on the grounds of the white horse bar.  The campechana is the only tacos I ve tried and I ll always continue to come back. It is perfectly spicy with a sweet spin  they put pineapple in their campechana .  I m not sure if the tortillas are homemade  but they were tasty- not my favorite  but not bad.  Now  I must write this with a caveat  the campechana is made differently by different cooks. Sometimes the tacos are good  not great and other times  it is cooked to perfection.  Anyways  I d recommend giving this place a try.
Bomb Tacos,5,  Uber eats order . We had arrived pretty late and this was one of the few places open. They messed up the order. We ended up with soggy tacos and not so great quesadillas instead. The green sauce was actually good and saving grace.
Bomb Tacos,6,We got an airbnb near by and was craving for some food around 9PM and went to 6th street hoping there was some food we can grab around there. Most of the places were closing down at 10PM  so we went out to grab food kinda late. We were told from one of the restaurant that The White Horse had some food trucks that are open late which was this. We walked here and saw that the taco truck is gated in and connects with the bar.   Approaching the bouncer  he was very rude and not helpful at all. We ignored him and just had 2 people go in to get some tacos because that s what we came there for. We got a bunch of different types of tacos from pastor  bistec  beef fajitas to hawaiian. The hawaiian was delicious  They were  4 each and a large portion. I would definitely giving the hawaiian tacos a try. I give the tacos a 5 star and the service at The White Horse itself a 2  If I m ever in the area and craving for some food late at night  this will be my go to.
Bomb Tacos,7, Uber Eats order  I got the Popeye quesadilla and literally couldn t eat it. It was soaking in oil  even the outside of the tortillas  and the mushrooms were extremely slimy and a horrible texture. If there was cheese in the quesadilla I couldn t tell because the mushrooms were so wet the tortilla was sliding off.  God awful.
Bomb Tacos,8,Ordered birra tacos on Uber eats. The driver took forever to come so food was cold but those tacos were amazing cold and all
Bomb Tacos,9,These are the best tacos you ll have in Austin... birria  pastor  chorizo  locos - everything is awesome - the BOMB  I m still kinda new to Austin and don t trust all food trucks  but I m so happy that I was put in to this one
Bomb Tacos,10,The only thing  bomb  about this place is what s going to happen in your bathroom afterwards.  What did I just eat   I ordered Nachos but what I was served was some Philly Cheesesteakesqe slop smothered over soggy and stale chips.  Whoever put this place on their  Best Nachos In Austin  list was clearly on hour fourteen of a peyote-induced vision quest.  Avoid for your personal health and wellness...and probably others around you.
Bomb Tacos,11,Ordered bomb tacos thru uber eats and it was a terrible waste of money by me  food by them  and then gas the uber driver spent to deliver this disgusting order.  This was the first time ordering from bomb tacos and certainly the last. The google reviews are true  I suggest filtering by most recent.  Read the reviews    The 3 crunchy tacos I ordered a la cart  were made with chili sauce and not real ground beef  seasoned.  The rest of our order was incorrect with beef not chicken chipotle quesadilla. It was greasy and incorrect.   The fries weren t cooked all the way from the fries and quesadilla order.  They are soggy and greasy and would be edible only after I cook them longer in the oven.  Complete waste  I would never recommend this place.
Bomb Tacos,12,Bomb tacos is the most mf bomb tacos you ll ever have in your life most likely. If you want to eat something that will pull you from whatever deep dark pit that you reside in  then trust me and go to bomb tacos. I can personally testify that I was sad before I ate these and now I m not. Go to bomb tacos. You will be happy.
Bomb Tacos,13,Bomb Tacos  I think I got a dud. Not very good product. Pastor had a weird flavor to it.  Quesadilla with cheddar cheese  Meh.  Gordita was good.
Bomb Tacos,14,The first of Austin s hidden treasures I ever unearthed.  I ve erred in not putting up a review in a timely manner.  Bomb Taco is a little orangey-red taco truck parked in the back of the White Horse.  Tried their beef fajita and the  Carne Guisada  tacos and who knew...they were  the bomb .  Darned good flavor and texture.  Queso was a little watery.  Definitely worth a visit when you re taking a break from the tunes at the White Horse.  This place scores a 4 out of 5 on the  CTJ Scale   as noted below.  5 out of 5 stars  Come-to-Jesus good. Would be OK passing away after finishing a plate here. 4 out of 5 stars  Come-to-Mary good. Would be OK being seen eating here by Mother Mary. 3 out of 5 stars  Come-to-Joseph good. Would be OK having a beer here with Jesus  Dad. 2 out of 5 stars  Come-to-the-Apostles good. Meh. Wouldn t have my last supper here. 1 out of 5 stars  Come-to-Nobody good. I wouldn t have my penultimate supper here  either.
Bomb Tacos,15,My whole trip visiting Austin  this has to be one of the best food stops that we ve made. Cheap  BIG  delicious  4 tacos  that serve until 1AM. The pastor tacos were great  my boyfriend really enjoyed his Hawaiian  and personally my favorite was his carne guisada taco. The green sauce is HOT  but it makes the flavor so much better and gives it a kick. Don t pass up on these tacos 
Bomb Tacos,16,Taco places in bars are there to keep body and soul together.  I had my tacos.  My body and soul are still together.         The tacos are tasty.  They have a huge menu  a small stand and a lot of customers.  This means a lot of things sell out - and that is just the new normal.   If you have a small truck and a lot of customers and you don t want to sell out - you only sell two or three items and you stock them deep.  If you have thirty items on the menu - you can t stock much of any one item and many will disappear as the night progresses.   But there really aren t any landmines on the menu.  If you have to have your second  fifth or twenty-third choice - no need for tears.  The food will be fine - regardless of what flavor you get.
Bomb Tacos,17,It s a food truck in the back of the white horse bar and is honestly one of the best tacos I have had in Texas     I got a fish taco- ask for extra hot sauce- green sauce- SO GOOD          The guy was kind of slow to make the tacos but it was worth the wait. Bring cash 
Bomb Tacos,18,I always ordered tacos al pastor  they re always delicious HOWEVER...  No matter what  without fail  the 4 times I ve tried  I say no cilantro and guess what my tacos are covered in  Cilantro. I spend 10 minutes picking it out.
Bomb Tacos,19,I do not recommend this place. I got my order completely wrong through the Uber eats app. Utensils and condiments were missing. Food was cold. Eat somewhere else 
Bomb Tacos,20,Uber Eats Order  The food arrived cold and soggy  almost inedible. We tried the nachos  queso  and tacos. The nachos were a mess of stale  soggy chips - we couldn t find a crispy one on the entire plate. The queso was cold and separated with little taste. The crispy tacos were complete mush. Everything lacked flavor and spiciness. I tried a bite of each and had a popsicle for dinner instead. I will not order from them again.
Bomb Tacos,21,When you re tipsy and hungry and it s late there s nothing better than this hidden gem  a food truck on the patio at The White Horse.   Tacos are inexpensive  they re large and filling  and you get to watch  em be made. Couldn t have asked for better. I don t know that they re actually the best tacos in the world or anything  but the SO and I were so incredibly happy and pleased. They hit the spot  they were delicious  and the green sauce hot sauce that the chef recommended was on point. So  so good. Perfect for laying with whiskey on tap at the bar...
Bomb Tacos,22,Tortillas...store-bought  amp  taste microwaved. ALL tacos tastes like bland beef fajita meat. Queso is very watered down and thin -- Good luck trying to scoop it on your chips  Fish tacos have a mild freezer-taste  all the spices in the world don t get rid of That Taste...Ehh  At one time I m sure they had Bomb Tacos...as of last night and a couple of times before  it s Official  this place Sucks  Sorry  but if you haven t been here yet  don t bother  in fact I recommend just about Anywhere Else in the area.  If you re drunk and don t care what you re eating  then go for it   It s conveniently located in the White Horse outdoor drinking area  so ya don t have to walk very far.  But keep in mind  you re paying as much as any other taco stand in the area and only receiving mediocrity...actually Less than Mediocrity.  But if you re drunk  then I guess it doesn t really matter  The tacos weren t bad  but I could make better tacos at home.
Bomb Tacos,23,Hidden gem   However  depending on the taco that you get  it s a HIT OR MISS  The first time that I came here  I got the bistec taco. It was amazing  The meat was full of flavor. MUST GET THE GREEN HOT SAUCE   it s delicious  I also tried the fries with queso but wasn t a big fan so I drowned it with the green hot sauce which made it much better. The second time that I came  I tried the campechana taco which was disgusting. I would not recommend it.
Bomb Tacos,24,This place gained one star only because this time I got to try the tacos I ordered. However it was quite bland when compared to other taco trucks around Austin. Once again  they ran out of a lot of food and it was probably only midnight - still 2 more hours of service left. My husband finally gave up trying to eat there.  There is also only one guy working there which really slows down business. He takes an order and immediately makes it. Instead  I think because there is only one guy  he should take a 2-3 orders at a time so he can make bulk amounts.
Bomb Tacos,25,I ordered  30 worth of tacos via Uber eats.   My tacos arrived smothered in cheese  which I requested them without.   Uber eats wouldn t approve the refund  so I just wasted  30 on food I couldn t eat bc the restaurant was careless.
Bomb Tacos,26, Uber Eats Order    Vegan. Specifically asked for no cheese on tacos  all came with cheese. Couldn t eat it  called several times with no answer.  Asked for no lettuce or pico for daughters taco. Came with lettuce and pico. She couldn t eat it.   Extremely disappointed as a first time customer.
Bomb Tacos,27,Ordered the nachos and they were terrible. Chips were stale  not much cheese  and it didn t come with the ingredients listed on the menu  jalape os . Also ordered tacos on corn tortillas. If they don t have corn they didn t mention that. I can t eat flour so they went in the trash.  cornmeanscorn
Bomb Tacos,28,The tacos were awesome. Not sure why they have so many bad reviews. Maybe bad Uber Eats drivers taking too long 
Bomb Tacos,29,everything was cold  fries were soggy and I asked for no onions and it came with tons of onions  super disappointed   
Bomb Tacos,30,Wow. So bad. Like I didn t know you could make nachos this poorly.  I wasn t expecting the best at 1am but dang this was bad. Ordered a beef taco too  meat was soggy and bland and super gross.
Bomb Tacos,31,So quick review...  The tacos were super delicious  I got the bistec taco no onion and the Hawaiian no vegg. The Hawaiian was my favorite  So flavorful and the chicken and pineapple were grilled just right.  Now  the reason for the 2-stars...I waited for I don t know how long for the lil dude  who was by himself  in the trailer to first off even acknowledge my presence and secondly to take my order. Seriously  it was totally off-putting to be ignored...I seriously felt invisible and felt almost annoyed when the guy could be bothered to even take my order.  Everyone standing in line behind me said it is the MO and worth the wait  but I gotta confess  not a fan. I know there is an expected no-expectation of  service  but this one just floored me. I think I would have way better about the whole experience if the guy would have just took two seconds to say  be with you in a moment   but treating me like I wasn t there til he was ready to  deal with customers . The surprising part was  the tacos came out way faster than my order wait time   But  I guess he has a captive audience in the patio of the White Horse  where being able to get a tasty taco at 1am without having to walk more than 5 steps and can do as he pleases...if I come back I will have someone else do the awkward wait dance for me and compensate them w a taco.
Bomb Tacos,32,I placed an order with Favor for 1 chicken taco and chicken quesadillas. I heard  the Bomb Tacos  have the best Salsa. The primary reason I ordered the food from them is for the salsa. I specifically mentioned I want extra salsa and guess what  I didn t even received one. on top of that they charged me extra  3 for the salsas. first they didnt give any salsa and they charged me extra for the extra salsa I requested which I didnt get. utter disappointment. I would give negative 5 rating if I could. the food is not cheese and chicken with no flavor. You have succeed in loosing one more customer.
Bomb Tacos,33,Terrible. Got old meat in  50 worth of food that we ordered. I understand we are going through a recession....but don t try and kill people with old meat
Bomb Tacos,34,Don t bother unless you really need some sustenance fuel an alcoholic binge. Tacos al pastor we re just weird. Plus they suspiciously overcharged us maybe thinking we were some drunk tourists. Try elsewhere for real Mexican
Bomb Tacos,35,This was by far the worst tasting meal I have had during quarantine...if not ever. One bite and I could tell they were using old meat that had freezer burn. During this terrible time I have done my best to support local but stuff like this will scare people away. Please use quality ingredients so that you do not give other local restaurants a bad name.
Bomb Tacos,36,I cannot tell you enough how much I hope and pray this taco stand is open by my house. They have a location off of William Cannon and OH MY GOD I can t even tell you how amazing they are. Yes they have a menu but they let you get whatever you want. And the chipotle sauce  AHHHHH  Hands down one of the best food trucks I have had since moving here. Everything is cooked to order and cooked with love. You re missing out if you ve never had it.
Bomb Tacos,37,Hidden in the back of white horse  this place is a gem     Brought our drinks out from the bar and were surprised by this little guy taco truck.  We ordered the beef quesadilla  amp  nachos.  The quesadilla was gigantic  soo tasty   With the salsa verde it was fantastic.  We also ordered the nachos  they were ENORMOUS   Easily shared with 2-3 people.  Highly recommend coming here 
Bomb Tacos,38,The queso tasted like bleach  or some kind of cleaning solution. Perhaps they didn t properly rinse their pots after cleaning. Regardless  we took one bite and threw it all in the trash  food and money wasted . We couldn t even salvage any chips  since they pour the queso over the chips rather than putting it on the side.   BEWARE 
Bomb Tacos,39,Great tacos at a great price  Also easy to get delivered  Highly recommend but the quesadilla was just meh...
Bomb Tacos,40,We waited 40 minutes for our food after ordering behind one other group. After seeing the people behind us get their food  we asked about the eta for our food and couldn t get an answer. Just two dudes in a trailer that didn t seem to care that much. Cash only.
Bomb Tacos,41,Y all ready for this  So they re cash only even though they don t make that evident on their page. We ordered at 11 14. We asked for an update at 11 42.  It ll be 3 minutes . At 11 58 we asked for our money back. They handed it back like that was their job instead of making tacos.
Bomb Tacos,42,I am convinced the people working here have only half a brain. This is the third time I ve given them a chance but never ever again. On Uber eats when selecting my tacos they have the option of  no cilantro  I picked it because I am allergic. I even put in the notes  NO CILANTRO PLEASE  and every time they cover my tacos In cilantro. I also ordered the gorditas which were pretty awful. So dry and so bland. Such a disappointment.
Bomb Tacos,43,Tortillas were not homemade. Five mini tacos were cold. Queso was not that great and the quesadilla looked and tasted like a kid made it. Super disappointed 
Bomb Tacos,44,  great portions   well priced   excellent flavor   nuffsaid  p.s. fyi  they re parked in the back of whitehorse bar. yelp s gotta implement something to show when one business is basically part of another
Bomb Tacos,45,Tried to get tacos  but it was impossible to find the entrance from within white horse. The bouncer was rude and not helpful. Maybe making the restaurant accessible would help their rating  
Bomb Tacos,46,Being from NY  I m super picky about food. After a busy day at a conference I decided to order in and this place hit the spot. I ordered 4 different tacos and every single bite was amazing. The portions are very generous without sacrificing the quality of the food. Not sure why other reviewers say the food was  mediocre . I was completely satisfied.
Bomb Tacos,47,This place is legit   The campechana is just like the ones in Mexico City. Honestly going to go here specifically for these tacos. Radically delicious 
Bomb Tacos,48,This is my first yelp review but I had to post because this food truck does not deserve to have customers. The attendant was so rude. My date and I were more than accommodating when we had a long wait before we were helped and were told to pay cash even though there was no  cash only  sign. When we said we had no cash  the attendant sighed and held his hand out for our card. We witnessed him tell the next customers the wrong price for their meal and sass other customers. Never have I been so disrespected as a restaurant patron.
Bomb Tacos,49,Incredible late-night food. Plus  Juan is the nicest guy you ll ever meet. In my experience  the more interesting  imaginative things on their menu are definitely the way to go.
Bomb Tacos,50,Order from this restaurant on Uber Eats and 99  of the time the order is incorrect.  The majority of the time they don t read or ignore the notes in all caps NO CHEESE. The last time the menu didn t say cheese would be added to anything. I am extremely allergic to cheese    I wish could give them a big fat 0   
Bomb Tacos,51,This is dog food.  Seriously  this the most horrible dining experience. Not only was the food absolute garbage  the chef blatantly lied to me citing they serve homemade authentic tortillas which were  of course  nonexistent.    It only took two bites to wrap my head around The fact this taco was most likely a biohazard.  I then had the pleasure of being physically grabbed by a hygienically unkempt bearded management man from White Horse who took no effort to try and make right the totally inedible and absurdly overpriced garbage served to me with some type of apology.  Then I went inside of the White Horse and experienced what seemed to be a nightmare of equal horror versus the food served to me. No refunds  no apologies  and downright unethical lies about the freshness of this food that belongs in the dumpster. Do yourself a favor and never eat there. Unless of course you like to eat feces.
Bomb Tacos,52,Had the chipoltle chicken quesadillas and they were sooo delicious. Only thing that bothered me was that it seemed the guy had bad English  but they were sooo good that I was almost tempted to 5 star this place right off the bat.
Bomb Tacos,53,I was watching the Sunday football game in the back patio of bar 96 and thought I would try a fish taco. Wasn t anything special in my opinion. The tortilla was cold and it wasn t really put together well.
Bomb Tacos,54,Just when I thought Taco Joint had established the nadir of Austin Mexican Food  I grabbed two vile tacos at this abomination. As the White Horse slowly transitions to a Rainey Street crowd  it is only natural that the food would nosedive. The beans taste worse than canned Rosarita beans  the guy at the counter lied to my friend that the tortillas are homemade  the French fries with queso seemed to be from a frozen bag and drizzled with Rico s or velveeta. I would suggest that you disregard all reviews from anyone giving this four or five stars. These are the worst tacos I ve experienced in the U.S. Taco Bell is significantly better. The only positive is that they throw some things on a grill -- hardly impressive  but in this post-Torchy s universe  I guess anything beats nothing.
Bomb Tacos,55,The BEST tacos in town  hands down. The options are endless  and the veggie options are awesome. I couldn t believe such simple sounding tacos could taste so beyond what I was expecting. And they have never disappointed me so far.   Look  I don t even like the bar that they are parked inside the fence of  White Horse  but I will go there and I will expect to eat their tacos. In fact  White Horse is probably my least favorite bar on the eastside  but I find myself asking   Me   Can we go to White Horse   Him   You just want to eat tacos.   Me   Damn right I do  Don t judge me    Just do yourself a favor and venture over to Bomb Tacos. There s no fake fancy frills about it  and I love that. Just doing what they do best  as simple as it sounds  TACOS and tacos on the cheap. The way tacos should always be.
Bomb Tacos,56,Huge portions for a reasonable price. Unfortunately the food looks better than it tastes. I tried the pastor burrito and was expecting it to be great  the guy put a ton of pork in it with a bunch of other stuff. Didn t taste like anything though
Bomb Tacos,57,With a name like  Bomb Tacos  I had set my expectations high.  What I got was an overcooked meat bistek taco. The tortilla and queso fresco were good  I ll give them that.  Then again  it was late  drunk people hour at the White Horse... Not exactly the place to expect a high quality taco truck. It did it s job  it was properly seasoned  and the salsa saved me from getting angry at the Paisa who made my taco.  I call these  Tacos for Hipsters who Just Don t Know .
Bomb Tacos,58,David was serving us and he worked quickly  diligently  and kindly. He exhibited excellent customer service and we will definitely be back on our next trip to Austin.
Bomb Tacos,59,This place is amazing. Fantastic food despite the crowd. No line  just great service. And the food  my god...
Bomb Tacos,60,The BBQ chicken  breast meat  tacos is comprised of delicious ingredients packed into a  3 bargain  4 stars .  The tasty corn tortilla was full of quality chicken meat  shredded cheese and queso fresco  and topped with pico de gallo.  I also tried the beef and potato picadillo taco but it wasn t my favorite  3 stars .
Bomb Tacos,61,These guys screwed me  took my money and never gave me my order  when I asked for it they recognized  gave me my order 10 people after me and when we asked for an extra quesadilla  they laughed at me and ignored us...disappointed. good foof  but customer service sucked    
Bomb Tacos,62,With so many trailers in town I m always happy to find a really good one--this is a really good one. Got the spinach and mushroom taco and the pulled pork taco  both excellent. My friend got the burrito  chicken --it was huge and also great. Add a Live Oak beer and a really good zydeco band inside and it doesn t get much better.
Bomb Tacos,63,Dear Austin   I approve of your taco trucks  especially this one. It s parked outside the White Horse and holy. friggin. moly.  Their special Friday night  Shrimp and barbacoa taco plates  so naturally I asked for one of each kind. The barbacoa was good  but the fried shrimp was some of the best I ve ever had. They don t need even sauces because the filling is so good  but you should put all the sauces on them anyway. Wonderful. The plates came with rice and beans too and it was something like  8.  My two friends and I sat in silence until we had cleaned our plates. Not to say that we weren t a little distracted by the honky tonk  the crazy-busy bar and the couple making out directly in front of us... but we were pretty occupied with inhaling tacos.  Saludos  Annie
Bomb Tacos,64,Grabbed tacos here.  Was drinking.  Don t exactly remember how it was... sorry.
Bomb Tacos,65,The mushroom and potato tacos was deep fried potato cubes with an otherwise really good mushroom. Sauce was decent and the tortilla was flour  kind of tasteless. Overall not that great.
Bomb Tacos,66,I understand this place is a new addition to the White Horse. I can t speak as to how new because it was my first visit  but  regardless  it is a welcome one    This little taco trailer rocks  I can t say we had anything bad here  We had the portobello taco  which was amazing  Great flavor and so juicy  Our party also ordered the pork and the al pastor. Everyone raved    The green sauce was not as spicy as Selene s but it had great flavor.   The tacos were  3 each and huge. Can t wait to go to the White Horse again just to eat another portobello taco. My mouth is watering just for writing this 
Bomb Tacos,67,What could be better than an ice cold beer at the legendary White Horse  Oh  I know  How about the best flipping taco of my life  I asked the guys in the taco truck what their favorite was and they said the Pastor. So I got it. And I cried a little. The fish taco was probably the best fish taco I ve ever eaten but the Pastor was so good I wanted to marry it. And did I mention it s cheap 
Bomb Tacos,68,I ve been frequenting Bomb Tacos for a few months now and have never EVER been disappointed. Service is friendly and quick. Tacos are cheap  delicious  and always served piping hot  and the menu is pretty diverse. I ve probably had upwards of a dozen different tacos off the menu and while some are better than others  i ve never been disappointed. Pulled pork and Chicken Breast are two of my favorites. Beyond the simple deliciousness of the tacos  the two sauces they serve with them should NOT be missed. Both are flavorful  spicy as hell  and an excellent accompaniment to any Bomb Taco. I m perplexed as to why the original Bomb Tacos outside of Lustre Pearl has such crappy ratings. I ve frequented both trucks more than I can to say and have never had anything but great experiences. I recommend Bomb Tacos to all my friends 
Bomb Tacos,69,They tried to charge me  119 for JUST an order of tacos and nachos   Check your receipts 
Bomb Tacos,70,This place is ok. Not awful but just too greasy for my liking. I tried a few of their items and nothing was stand out.
Bomb Tacos,71,Going here was a frustrating experience. First off  the phone number listed for Bomb Tacos is the White Horse general number  which takes you to a long recording and then hangs up on you. So...I guess they don t take call-in orders  I drove there to order because my bandmate wanted late-night enchiladas and based on the online menu this looked like the only place that had them at the hour I was seeking them. When I got to the restaurant I noticed that their posted menu was QUITE different from the online menu. I asked about the enchiladas and the guy behind the counter said   Oh  no  sorry.  I think they may have gotten this question before. So I ordered chips and salsa  some tacos  and a quesadilla for my enchilada-craving friend  all to go. When the chips and salsa were ready I was surprised to see that the salsa was already drizzled all over the chips  which meant that they would be soggy by the time I got back to my bandmates. On the plus side  the salsa was tasty and the guy at the counter was nice. But...they ve still lost my business. Should have stuck with El Chilito 
Bomb Tacos,72,Next time I m hungry and at the White Horse  I ll move mountains to go elsewhere for food.  Yeah  the food is good but the guy who runs the truck by himself is a total jerk-off and has bitten off more than he can chew.  There are plenty of friendly food trucks in the East Austin bar area and I m going to give my business to them  going forward.  I get that it s tough to run a food truck  blah blah blah  but    A.  I think people need to acknowledge their customers when they re waiting in YOUR line to order YOUR food  even if you re too busy to take their order.   I ll be right with you  would have gone a long way  rather than no eye contact even though he walked back and forth past me to grab ingredients  call out order numbers  etc. for over 15 minutes.  I almost walked away several times.  I don t know why I didn t.  B.  When you finally DO get around to picking up your food  if there s an issue with your order  don t even bother addressing it with him.  Once he puts the food in your hands  he s done.  I ordered a quesadilla and he gave me a taco.  When I told him  this isn t a quesadilla   he firmly insisted  NO  NO  That s right  and turned his back to me and went back to work.  OK dude.  I give up.  You suck.    I know you re making lots of money  Mr. stressed-out-over-extended-crabby-pants-taco-man  so hire a helper for minimum wage and your business will run much smoother.  If your business runs smoother  I doubt you d have any negative reviews on Yelp  and VOILA - you re the next East Side King trailer  pre-Top Chef.  Are you too greedy and don t want to share tips or pay an extra hand   Do you not realize there is a problem   Please know that EVERYONE was complaining about you last night.  I hope you care about that  even though I know you re making plenty of bank conducting business as-is.  Siiiiiiiiiiigh.
Bomb Tacos,73,One of the best Taco stands in Austin.  The guy knows what he s doing and the food comes out perfect everytime..  this places knows whats up.  the nachos are out of control  but really the best thing here is the shrimp tacos.... Everything I v had was great  but those shrimp tacos are out of this world... I ve never gotten ones as good as these since being in mexico.  this place is worth the stop..  Plus they are at the White Horse.. best bar in Austin....    
Bomb Tacos,74,Dare I say  this is my favorite taco truck in Austin. There  I said it. The veggie options are out of this world.
Bomb Tacos,75,Soooo good. Got the bistec tacos and they were absolutely amazing  They reminded me of the tacos they sell back home
Bomb Tacos,76,Best tacos and it s in the back of the white horse. We had the Nachos with beef  carne Asad taco  and veggie quesadilla. My boyfriend can t stop talking about the quesadilla and how it s the best he s ever had  Good tacos  nice people 
Bomb Tacos,77,You had better be drunk and desperate to eat here.  It s the east side.  You can find better food than this.
Bomb Tacos,78,  Ok nachos especially if you love onions. The nachos were the way I like them  too many toppings so you have to eat them with a fork. No complaints about the amount of toppings however with the amount of onions.. it was pretty much all I could taste. For the price  nine bucks  I should be able to taste a lot more cheese. It was okay however I will not return.
Bomb Tacos,79,In the sea of Tex-Mex in Austin  finding authentic tacos can be treacherous. Search no further  Bomb Tacos are cheap   3 for a heavy-loaded taco   fast  and delicious. When out-of-towners ask me to take them somewhere authentic  this is the only option I know...and it doesn t hurt that it s at the White Horse  greatest bar on the east side.
Bomb Tacos,80,I think this is one of the best food trailers in Austin  plus its on the patio of the best honky tonk in town   3 tacos...all are delicious and seasoned to perfection. Gotta love that spicy green salsa too 
Bomb Tacos,81,Ordered their shrimp tacos.  The shrimp were fried.  I guess I should have expected that  since this is Texas.  I m used to grilled shrimp tacos.  I wish they used corn tortillas though.  Overall kinda bland.
Bomb Tacos,82,Bomb delicious tacos. Get the Carne Guisada and add avocado. The meat is literally caramelized  NOM
Bomb Tacos,83,The best Al Pastor IN THE CITY. I frequent white horse just for these. My Mexican boyfriend confirms.
Bomb Tacos,84,These tacos are as good as they can get   2nd trip to Austin and second trip to  The Bomb    Fish  pork and chicken were tried tonight at the White Horse and all are so full of flavor and enhanced with their green sauce.  Definitely worth a try y all 
Casa Moreno's,1,Happy 18th birthday Casa Moreno  We unexpectedly came during Casa Moreno s 18th birthday celebration  and it was such a fun time.The local band Trez Amigos was playing  local artists had small tables outside  free cupcakes were passed out  and there was a raffle to win dozens of different prizes. I m sure events like this don t happen that often  but we left here very happy and satisfied   Food-wise  breakfast tacos are HUGE and come with 12 inch tortillas  they re more like skinny burritos  . We  almost  made the mistake of ordering several per person  but thankfully we noticed how big they were. The huevos rancheros were also tasty and filling   Service was rather slow but it was busy and completely understandable during their big birthday celebration.
Casa Moreno's,2,Wow. How often do you see the reviews appear as a perfect reverse bell curve  with most at the 1 star or 5 star level   You ll pay here for chips and unremarkable salsa. Why  This ain t on the San Antonio riverwalk to be sure.  They are open for dinner only on the weekend  and they reopen after the lunch hours. I can t imagine how few places do a split shift like that  which no servers worth their salt are going to subject themselves to in 2022. So of course  we did not have the kind of server who was going to go to to bat with the kitchen  to be accommodating towards a vegetarian request for a chalupa that is apparently available only when the buffet is offered.   They did have sufficient knowledge and skills to scramble an egg and make a better than average pancake.   Just another disappointing entry in the very short list of otions on Ben White between 35 and the airport. A cultural desert. A food desert.
Casa Moreno's,3,Summary  mostly disappointing for various reasons detailed below. The tortillas were chipotle size with 25  of the filling which made for dry overpriced tacos. The one upside is their tortillas tasted handmade rather than the plastic bulk tortillas some places use. The picadillo and machacado would get them run out of San Antonio if it were served there. Others were average but overpriced. Would not go back.  Picadillo  poor excise for picadillo. Plain unseasoned ground beef with dry mealy unseasoned potatos. Topped with a little bit of pico de gallo not even cooked into the meat.  Machacado  NOT machacado  which is made with dried beef. This was just barbacoa with a tiny bit of egg mixed in it. Some of the greasiest barbacoa I ve had.  Carne guisada  not bad  not much to say. Standard carne guisada.  Los chismes  Asada with chorizo and queso. I liked the filling on this one  the asada was tender and the chorizo added a lot of flavor. Only downside was there was not enough meat. The giant tortilla dominated and made the whole thing extremely dry.   Suicide  behemoth with all the fillings. Could easily feed two people. I added sausage which the crumbly kind rather than sliced sausage which seems strange for a Mexican restaurant. Not sure I d order again  a little overkill.
Casa Moreno's,4,Ok  this place has one thing going for it at breakfast.  They serve big tacos.  Heck  they re what people in Lubbock and Amarillo would legitimately call breakfast burritos.  What they don t do is serve a good taco.  I was very unimpressed by the potato -- which was barely cooked.  And the salsa lacks any kick.  When you combine that with a relatively slow moving line and the basic lack of amenities for eating a taco while there  you quickly decide there are better options.
Casa Moreno's,5,New to the area and everything we ve tried so far before CM seemed to be more  central American  than the Tex-Mex we are accustomed to. I had the Migas plate  amp  Hubs had the buffet. We both really enjoyed the food. The flavors  amp  taste were closer to what we like. Our server Liz was great. I would give her 5 stars alone. Give this place a try 
Casa Moreno's,6,Looking for a good time with karaoke and dancing  This was it.  Spur of moment drop in for food. Loud for karaoke and Fun atmosphere.  Food was good.  I wanna come back just for the dance  and music     Didn t get a chance for an adult beverage and had to manually tally our tab. 4 meals  2 beers  1tea.  201.  I THINK NOT   Something very wrong with that lil wrist machine
Casa Moreno's,7,I was excited to give this place a second try   Im from a city that has amazing breakfast tacos so my boyfriend  Austin native  raves about this place . The tortilla is huge but hard and it is only filled about 10 . I was very disappointed as this is the second time I have not been satisfied.
Casa Moreno's,8,You know what  I liked it  It s not anything like amazing or crazy special  but the staff was so nice  the buffet is small but I live for variety and combo plates so I enjoyed that  and I would definitely go back    The guacamole plate was  6 so maybe leave that one off and stick to just the buffet 
Casa Moreno's,9,I ve been wanting to eat here for years and I finally had the opportunity last week. My husband and I hit up the lunch buffet on Friday. Everything here was super easy and fast  which I appreciated since we had errands to run. We were seated  drinks ordered and we were able to immediately get in line for the buffet. They had enchiladas  rice  beans  guisada  fajitas  papas  fideo and more all on the buffet. I tried a little of most of it and it was delicious. I was definitely full after finishing my plate. I know it s a buffet  but I wasn t able to make a second trip. Believe me if you are looking for a good hearty lunch and to fill up then this is the spot. Service was excellent and the price was awesome  I ll definitely be back and won t wait so long next time 
Casa Moreno's,10,Me and some of my friends really enjoy Thursdays at Casa Moreno s. DJ 2DQ has gotten the party started on past Thursday evenings that I ve been to. This is a great spot for get togethers with family and especially if you have teenagers because they keep the place fun.   The food is always good and so is the service but we really enjoy the lively atmosphere and nice mix of ages and people.
Casa Moreno's,11,Even after they moved  still a huge fan of this place despite price increases and what looks like a move to become more like a torchys franchise with tacos of the month and rewards. Maybe they got a high paid social media manager making them less like a Alice tx restaurant and more like what s in. Either way still love me a suicide
Casa Moreno's,12,Vibe is great  they played classics along with having classing Mike Tyson Muhammad Ali fights on. The food is good  i ordered the suicide burrito along with rice and beans and i couldn t finish it cause it was so much. Very good tho. However  the service could be better. I had to call on my waitresses multiple times to get a refill  napkins  the check. Overall 3 5
Casa Moreno's,13,I like to come here in the morning if I really want to get some fuel for my day  just grab one of their Suicide Taco  it s enough .  Kind of an odd location for a restaurant  but it s on my way to work so I stop every once in a while.  One of the ladies were pretty rude to me once... although it s never happened again  I don t really see the problem stopping by  I just grab a to go bag so I don t have to deal with anyone but the cashier.
Casa Moreno's,14,My first time going today and I was very pleased with service and cleanliness of the restaurant. The food was AMAZING  I had the breakfast burrito and did not finish it all had the rest for lunch. I am excited to take my family next weekend.
Casa Moreno's,15,Great as always.. I really have only eaten their breakfast but it is always delicious  I highly recommend the Huevos Rancheros  it s my favorite 
Casa Moreno's,16,Went to this place in the morning for some breakfast tacos. I got 1 barbacoa taco and my husband got 2 tacos 1 barbacoa and a bacon egg and beans taco. The Barbacoa was really greasy and had a lot of fat and had no salt . My husband bacon egg and bean taco was burnt like how do you burn eggs   Wanted some salsa for our tacos and we asked 1 waitress  since our waitress didn t even bother to Acknowledge her own table   she had  said ok but never brought it out . At this point is already aggravating so my husband had to go up to their podium and asked our waitress for the salsa while she was on the phone . She finally brought out a red salsa and it wasn t to bad.Actually wanted green salsa but didn t want to ask since the service was bad. Needed better service and better tacos.
Casa Moreno's,17,The tacos that I got were nasty. Point blank. I m surprised that this place would serve this to a customer. You should try the food before serving it. The pastor tasted like freezer burn. So gross. I took one bite and threw it in the garbage where it belongs.
Casa Moreno's,18,Casa Moreno s draws a crowd.  I went there in the pouring rain on a frigid day - the kind of day that makes most Austinites stay home.  Casa Moreno s was packed - and this was at 11 o clock in the morning.  I expect the place was going to be even more packed for lunch.   This is the only restaurant I have ever been to in far Southeast Austin that draws major major crowds.  The crowds know what s good and Casa Moreno s is good.         Because of the pandemic  Casa Moreno s is working on a limited menu.  They are known for their lunchtime buffet.   The lunchtime buffet looked like it would have been fantabulous but that is temporarily shut down.  What is left is pretty good though.         Key point   Usually we judge restaurants by the primary main dishes.  You probably have Mexican restaurants here in town whose main dishes you like better.  Casa Moreno s is all about the side dishes.  On the side dishes  they are world beaters.  Casa Moreno s makes the best flour tortilla in town.  There are a lot of fine fine homemade tortillas in Austin.  Nearly all of them are corn tortillas.  Flour tortillas are usually Tex-Mex cuisines answer to white bread.  Tortillas made with masa harina have power  have soul  have character.  Flour tortillas taste like nothing. You save those for serving to wimps.  Casa Moreno will change your mind about flour tortillas.  Their flour tortilla is about twice the size of a normal tortilla.  It is thick and puffy.  One Casa Moreno flour tortilla is like eating a hot loaf of freshly baked bread.  It is not technically buttery - but it might just as well be.  It is utterly comforting and utterly filling.  If you have had a Casa Moreno flour tortilla  Mommy has just made you lunch.  The world is a good place.  The other majorly good side dish is refried beans and rice.  You didn t hear me say two dishes refried beans and also rice.  They mix the two together.  Most Mexican restaurant rice is awful.  Most Mexican restaurant refried beans are ho hum.  Their rice by itself is okay. The beans by themselves are mildly superior.  The combo is the perfect side dish.  They don t give you very much - but you don t need very much.  The combo is good and even small amounts of it leave you happy and satisfied.  My main dish was chicken enchiladas in a suiza sauce.  The main dishes are pleasant but just okay.  That was the case here.  BUT .... and this matters ...  Take the jalapeno that comes with the enchiladas seriously.  Seriously like a treat  not seriously like a threat.  The dish only works when you eat it with the enchilada.  The garnish is not optional. It is mandatory.  Because of this they give you a great big muddafugga slice of jalapeno.  And if you look carefully off in the corner they give you another great big muddafugga slice of jalapeno.  The enchiladas may be bland by themselves but with the jalapeno the world gets interesting again.  That s why they give you two great big slices.  They want you to have enough to get through your entire entree.         Overall  this is a first rate establishment.  It might not be the one Mexican restaurant I would take an out of town guest to.  But if I am anywhere near Far Southeast Austin  I would go out of my way to eat here.  These guys have a lot of interesting ideas about how to serve food.  And remember    If you don t like your main dish.  You can always fill up on your tortilla.
Casa Moreno's,19,Went two weeks ago during lunch. Definitely need to go early to get parking. Lucky we found one in the front. Your choice of buffet or off the menu. The buffet was very good  but you will be in line. Buffet menu consisted of cheese enchiladas  fideo  beans  refried borracho   mini chalupas  chicken fajitas  carne guisada  papas fritas  ..... It was very delicious with huge tortillas with the buffet. You will need to wait again in a longer line as more patrons arrived so fill up your plate the first time. lol The food was very delicious. Will be going back in the near future. Wait staff was very prompt and the buffet server was sweet and let you get as much as you plate could be filled. Was not stingy with the servings.
Casa Moreno's,20,Stopped here on the way home from work the other morning. I really wanted a breakfast taco and had intentions of stopping somewhere else but the line was way long. I had never been here but drive by all the time. Wow  who knew. This place is pretty cool on the inside. I have been wanting to check it out  but the hours are different than when I want to go. Hard to figure out completely. The breakfast taco I got was a beef picadillo. It was yummy  Price was a little more than my other place I stop  but not bad. Will be stopping by to check out their taco tuesday special.
Casa Moreno's,21,This use to be one of our favorite places for Carne Guisada. I think they are so busy now the quality just isn t the same. I tried calling to place my order and the line wouldn t get answered and would be followed up with an automated message. I ordered when we got there and when we got home we were EXTREMELY disappointed. The tacos were all so dry  I choked on the tortilla and beef tip.  This is now our 3rd failed attempt to picking breakfast up in the last few months.
Casa Moreno's,22,Husband and I came here for dinner for the first time on a Thursday. Food was very bland and arrived at our table lukewarm at best. There was a DJ who started to set up and play music while we were eating . We ended up listening to about 10 minutes of music then asked for our ticket to pay. Our ticket seemed high for what we ordered. Turns out our server charged us an 18  tip twice  one per person  for subpar food and mediocre service and called it an event fee. First and last time here. Not worth it.
Casa Moreno's,23,Casa Moreno s has some of my favorite breakfast tacos  I ll give them that  and that s about it. What turned me off from ever going back was the lunch experience my co-workers and I had a week ago. There were six of us  but two got the lunch buffet  meaning other than bringing a drink  they didn t need to be waited on. The other four of us all had simple orders from the lunch menu. I got the sour cream enchiladas and I ordered some extra jalape os slices. The food was alright  my coworker wanted hot sauce for her flautas but apparently they re the only Tex-mex restaurant with no hot sauce in the building. My meal was  9.45 and drink was I believe  2  when it was time to pay the waitress told me my total was over  16. She said parties 6 or more were charged gratuity  25  to be exact  and this information is no where on the menu. And again  two of our people ate at the buffet. Oh and my little sauce cup of jalape os... 1.50. If you like being nickel and dimed  by all means  eat here  but they won t be getting my business anymore.
Casa Moreno's,24,This place has potential but unfortunately there s a lot to work on. The good  they have different events and is family friendly. The not so good is it is difficult to have a small gathering. If you want more than 6 people to a table they ll charge you a  100 FEE  they say deposit but you don t get this deposit back and this fee covers them putting tables together . It basically ensures you get better service than anyone else. My family had to sit on 3 different tables which were all separated but yet they still charged us 15-20  gratuity.  Some individuals on the same table were charged different amounts  Upon my arrival  which was after work  I waited 30 minutes and finally decided to try to order a drink and food at the bar. They sent me back to the table and I finally got a waitress. Once the food came I had no silverware  I definitely wasn t going to wait so I went and grabbed some myself. My nephew showed up and had a very similar experience. So ultimately  their service is terrible even nonexistent. They definitely didn t deserve the tip they gave themselves.
Casa Moreno's,25,The experience was a total disaster. First  they did not bring out two of our plates because they completely forgot about them. We were not checked on and kept having to waive random waiters down to get drinks. Then  we found a rubber band in our salsa   Honestly  don t even bother with this place. We came here trying to give it the benefit of the doubt but totally regret it.
Casa Moreno's,26,Never had a bad experience here intill today.. Paid for my food and my then got my notification from the bank that I was charged more than was on my receipt.  Apparently what they dnt you is if u pay with a card and don t leave a tip on the card their  system  will automatically add a tip. If my case it was a  9.00 add on . So on top of my cash tip they got an additional 9.00. So I paid  19.00 for self service on the lunch buffet.. I did get to speak with someone and hope that in the future they make customers aware of the add on charge before hand...
Casa Moreno's,27,Terrible service  our server checked on us once or twice and we just had to hope someone would check on us. The food took forever to come out and when it did it was cold. The sour cream enchiladas had no taste and the chicken looked questionable. We ended up sending a meal back and not ordering anything. Definitely will not be coming back.
Casa Moreno's,28,Terrible place. When you see others reviews about the terrible service here they are not kidding  We sat ignored by several servers for almost 15 minutes. We got up and left. Will not go back. I suggest going to Javi s TexMex which is only 3 minutes away. Hop back on Ben White and once you pass Riverside light turn in to the right. They have great food and drinks and we have always had friendly attentive staff.
Casa Moreno's,29,Food and drinks very limited basic enchiladas..tacos no variety same for drinks Mex Martini served in small glass NO SHAKER for same price as Trudys or Baby A s MM also if you use CC you will be charged a fee REGARDLESS and drinks served during hh in small plastic cups for full price the only thing this place is known for is there a breakfast suicide Taco other than that there is no real Worth to come here for anything other than breakfast.
Casa Moreno's,30,Noooooooo    It can t be    They no longer have the Chile relleno taco. Please bring it back    My heart is broken. I blame you COVID   
Casa Moreno's,31,This was very mediocre Mexican food. Not practicing Covid social distancing as the tables are very close together. Food was bland  the salsa was spicy  but that was the only good thing. Waitstaff paid little attention to us. Will not be going back.
Casa Moreno's,32,I was very upset about my order. First of all my exact order was 3 bean and cheese tacos... One carne Guisada with Cheese   and One beef  bean  and cheese taco. My carne guisada had Zero cheese in it. Michelle one of the managers answering the phone argued with me and said she saw the cook add cheese. Take it had had 4 other tacos with cheese   Lol She said I probably took too long to pick it up and it evaporated   What    I called in my order while sitting in the parking lot    A few minutes later I walked in to pick it up.  She displays so much unprofessionalism for that title.  When I first walked in she stood there arguing with another blonde young girl in front of me    I stood there patiently while she rambled on. Who does this  I work for the City of Austin and when our supervisor has an issue it is taken to the back office not carried on in front of clients. Who does she think she is to argue with me about my order.  First time here but never coming back   She could have carried herself differently. Hopefully the owner is reading this. I mean things happen by mistake and I can understand that. Usually people just order the carne guisada by itself. Simple mistake. Just correct it and move forward don t get confrontational with me about it. She probably saw the cook adding cheese to my other 4 tacos    She definitely needs people training skills.  No salsa either.
Casa Moreno's,33,Huge delicious breakfast tacos  which are actually more like burritos  the suicide is where it s at 
Casa Moreno's,34,Casa Moreno s is some next level good stuff  I only came her by accident. I was trying to eat at another nearby gem and they were closed and I was running short on time for lunch so I went to this place .. the only option close other than McDonald s or Jack in the Box.   I was expecting some below average Tex-Mex but when I walked in I could tell from the smell in the air that something very different was happening here. I noticed a buffet in the corner and lots of people going at it and decided that would work great with my extremely tight time scheduled.  When I got to the buffet and noticed the Handmade Tortilla s  Carne Guisada and Fideo my heart jumped with joy  I instantly got the feeling I was eating at someone s Grandma s house. The food was far above buffet quality and I had a 15 minute love affair with the Guisada and Fideo.  The people who wrote low scoring reviews for this place really needs to get  down off their high horse. The food is clearly made with love and care and is the kind of stuff I would like to eat every single day.   I will be going back  I ll be telling all of my co-workers about this place and I will be bringing people from out of town here. Do yourself a favor and eat this lunch buffet. Its under 10 dollars and some of the best food in the area 
Casa Moreno's,35,I ve always been skeptical of Casa Morenos - most specifically the kitchen. I ve been there a total of 4 times for a breakfast taco. I went there this morning and found this little label in my taco after biting it once    . If the potatoes are cooked fresh etc  which I m not sure since they were a little mushy ... I don t know how an am pm label would have been mixed in there.
Casa Moreno's,36,Today was my first time here and is my last time for sure  First  upon entering the place and walking up to the host stand they asked if we were eating in. What    Duh  We re not just standing here waiting for a picture.  Then the hostess looks at her watch and then says... we close at 2 00.  It was 1 15 btw. Already trying to get us to not stay 45 minutes before close.  Re the food  my Fajita plate was subpar with barely a seasoning and they only gave me one tortilla for a plate of fajitas. I asked for some more tortillas and they brought me one. No container of several like most every other restaurant.. One   My friends enchilada plate was so so according to her.  Then the kicker came when I got the check. They charged me  .75 for that one tortilla.  Service was terrible. They don t give you all utensils to eat. And to cap it off they charge 3.20  fee for using your card to pay for the meal.  Never again  
Casa Moreno's,37,I really wanted to like this place as I ve heard so many people rave about it but  it didn t do it for me. We waited about an hour for our food to come out. Being a pregnant woman hungry is not safe for anyone . We were excited to try the menudo but were greatly dissatisfied. It was awful. It tasted like a stew and it wasn t red  red like good menudo usually is. I had the 2 egg plate with potato s and beans and it lacked salt and tasted bland. I didn t get any tortillas with it either. If we do back again  I will be trying the tacos instead of a plate . Maybe their tacos are better. I felt they could ve done a better job of moving the tables further because we were pretty close to other customers . Still prefer Casa Garcia s
Casa Moreno's,38,Ordered extra crispy bacon They gave me raw looking bacon had to take it all out I told the 2 time for crispy bacon
Casa Moreno's,39,Grossest 24  I spent on food ever.   Beans were cold  hamburger meat over cooked  corn tortillas were not pre soaked prior to making enchiladas. This place came highly recommended and I dont understand how. Service is terrible so I cannot understand why anyone would return.
Casa Moreno's,40,Even before COVID I ate here all the time. Only reason it s a 3 star is because I noticed now  when me and my family try to call ahead of time the phone always goes to  too busy . Now I understand people are doing takeout more because of COVID  but this has been happening since before the pandemic. I called multiple times while waiting outside and when I walked in all the employees were in the back chilling and eating. Today  I was sitting in the waiting area and it was only me and a light dining room. So I decided to call and immediately the phone when to   too busy  and I asked what was the number just to make sure it was the same number I called and it was. Food is still great  but service seems sketchy.
Casa Moreno's,41,They regular. I probably had the worst horchata ever from there. I went for lunch. I had the chicken fajitas and they were ok. They only gave me one tortilla with the fajitas which was different to me. The beans were not the best of the best nor was the rice but it was close to closing so I advise don t go close to closing and they close at 2. However their breakfast tacos are pretty good. I will only go for that
Casa Moreno's,42,Let me start by saying that I have been going to this place for years and the customer service has gotten worst. If you re wanting to call for a take out  since there s no online way to do so  good luck. If you re lucky  they ll answer and if not then you might as well find another place. They have to realize people do take outs for a reason  people are busy these days. No one has a time to sit around for 15-20 while the food is ready  defeats the whole purpose. Also understand that your business only exists if you have customers  I m sure you re aware about your customer service so why not make attempts to fix it  Do you not care about your customer complaints or is it just not worth it  I hope you actually read this and work on your customer service  as a small business owner I always make sure to go above and beyond.
Casa Moreno's,43,I love this place. Fantastic Barbacoa. As some people mention the morning take-out wait can be crazy...but that now should change as they have moved into the large restaurant space around the corner which will soon have a bar  etc  I did some recon yesterday . Great food and local no frills feel.
Casa Moreno's,44,Casa says it all for Casa Moreno ...home made taste and great service.  The menudo is a must try  perfectly seasoned.  Also had a barbacoa taco  not dry like some places but still not overly moist. Delicioso.  Can t wait to come enjoy the buffet. They re open longer hrs as well.
Casa Moreno's,45,This place has awesome breakfast tacos for an unbeatable price. They are ginormous  AND they also taste fantastic. Here s what I had from there  Carne guisada  excellent meaty flavor without being too oily Bacon egg potato cheese  a little too much egg but otherwise fantastic Picadillo  excellent  reminiscent of burritos I ve had in El Paso. Favorite. Bean and cheese  I think the beans have bacon fat in them  they are amazing. Second favorite Chile relleno Taco  great idea for a taco but the beans were a weird addition. But still great  Every single taco from here was the size of a burrito from somewhere else. This place only has 3 stars on yelp for some stupid non-food-related reason which is extremely annoying. It deserves 5 stars and has better tacos than 99  of the tacos in Austin. Also I can get it delivered to my house with Uber eats.   Get tacos here  you won t regret it   
Casa Moreno's,46,Very delicious and kind waiters  You get more bang for your buck  Definitely will return 
Casa Moreno's,47,I really like the tacos here. My coworker likes them even more... but he s also 6 foot 7 inches tall  so that might explain his obsession with them - they are Tony-sized as he would put it.  In other words  they are like extra large burritos as far as size goes.... so you definitely get your money s worth here. My coworker swears by they re carne guisada. He loves it and always orders it.  Anyway  I like that I only need one taco to fill me up. They also taste quite delicious. Mmm...  I wish I could come here for frequently  but I start work when they open  so it s a little trickier  but I go whenever I can. Keep doing what you do best  Casa Moreno. You guys rock.
Casa Moreno's,48,Total disappointment  Very slow service  flavorless salsa. We ordered a couple of burritos  they were more like an oversized tacos lacked of flavor. The Migas were just tortilla chips with salsa on it   they got mine and my daughter s order wrong. It took for ever to get our insipid food  the pancakes tasted like McDonald s pancakes. I got there hungry and I left with our appetite.
Casa Moreno's,49,Great taste in Menudo   Not too great on the attentive service. I asked for water - never got it. Then - I m becoming more skeptical of receipts that don t itemize the prices of what you purchase.  16.50 for a Menudo and Coffee  That s a bit pricy. Won t be going back. Too bad...the food is great 
Casa Moreno's,50,Best breakfast tacos ever    Restaurant is small but they really make you feel like home  Suicide taco is a must 
Casa Moreno's,51,Best thing about Casa Moreno s were the beans and flour tortillas.  We had the taco plate  Carne guisada  and a large nacho plate with ground beef added -  very average and nachos were soggy.  Service was subpar at best.  Wait staff was indifferent and were sitting around.
Casa Moreno's,52,Great food with a nice lunch buffet option. Definitely great horchata. Stop by if you have time to sit down and enjoy lunch.
Casa Moreno's,53,A hole in the wall place   Best migas tacos ever     Very affordable   It s family owned and you can taste the love and care that they take to make the food.  The owners are super nice as well. It s a good place for kids.  My picky eater kids liked it as well.
Casa Moreno's,54,The breakfast food is out standing and would choose this place over any. The buffet is ok for what you get but nothing like the breakfast. What upsets me is they can t seem to ever answer the phone. Me and my co workers order or try to all the time and end up going in person and listen to the phone ring non stop and no one answers it. I would love to move the stars up to 5 if they can fix this problem.
Casa Moreno's,55,This is the place to eat... They have great carne guisada...Oh  i must mention they have a lunchtime buffet that does not cut back on the quality of the food. They have great staff  my waitress today Rose was excellent . This is truly a South Austin jew  i recommend this restaurant to everyone
Casa Moreno's,56,Small tex-mex lunch buffet is cheap and mostly delicious. The carne guisada is the best thing here  but we liked most of it. I did not like the enchiladas  which were made from some kind of greasy fake cheese. Nasty  Everything else was tasty though. It s crowded and busy  so the food is always fresh. Even as it got close to 2 00 pm  closing time   they kept refreshing all the most popular dishes.
Casa Moreno's,57,Big ass tacos I believe you get what you pay for never disappointed. You have to try the  suicide taco 
Casa Moreno's,58,Found this little hole in the wall where the Mexican food is great. It does truly taste like the food my Abuela  grandma  makes. They have really good breakfast with homemade tortillas the size of the plate. They also have a plentiful daily buffet that offers carne guisda  cheese enchildas  rice  refried beans  charro beans  fideo  chicken mole  chalupas  and giant size homemade flour tortillas for only  7.95. Amazing food at amazing prices. If you re in the area you need to try it. This Mexican food is like back home in Alice  Texas. I can t say enough good things about it. It is so wonderful i want to cry. Finally found a good Mexican restaurant in Austin.
Casa Moreno's,59,I legit had the best taco of my life here. The Picadillo breakfast taco  beef  pico  potatoes  was AMAZING. The seasoning was just perfect and the pico was just right. I also had the Migas breakfast taco which was also delicious. The prices were very affordable...  6.75 for two generously sized tacos. The wait staff were all very friendly and cheerful. I highly recommend this hole-in-the-wall  family-owned  unassuming place. It s not in a  trendy  part of Austin  but is grand 
Casa Moreno's,60,The service it s alright but the food it s really not good if you want to waste your money then this is the best restaurant I order some migas and some barbacoa the barbacoa was soaked on grease I couldn t even eat it and the migas plate tasted like if I was just eating nachos literally the food had no flavor
Casa Moreno's,61,Definitely an overlooked place within Austin. They are a great taco spot but that s where it ends. Service is decent  most of the menu is better than the average Mexican restaurant in Austin but the tacos are where they shine. Breakfast tacos are their specialty and I couldn t recommend more
Casa Moreno's,62,Don t listen to the haters  they don t know what they re talking about. The lunch buffet here is cheap  and even though its a small selection  they are all Tex Mex comfort foods. Not every restaurant in Austin has to be some high-falutin  20 dollar-a-plate blah-blah-fusion place. This is food from you grandmas kitchen. Think of the food like a church dinner level. Its good  there s plenty of it  and they ll bring you a bottle of choulula  except when they re out.  Usual selection is Enchiladas  rice  beans  refried or Ranchero   carne guisda  tostadas  chicken mole  large hand made flour tortillas  and of course salsa y chips. There are one or two other dishes that change out depending on what they re serving that day  but i can t remember what they were. Best part is  all of this  all you can eat   7.50  Nice folks there too.  Anyone else complaining about their  watery  salsa has never eaten mexican taquiera  throw it the blender  salsa. It s salsa. What the hell are you looking for  Chunky salsa with no juice  Thats called Pico. Tamale House 3 has the same salsa. You know why  Its salsa. Throw all the stuff in a blender. You what you get when you do that  SALSA.
Casa Moreno's,63,Casa Moreno s is the best place to get BIG breakfast tacos and they re cheap  I ve tried almost everything  I really love the Teo s  Migas  and the Picadillo is the best I ve ever tried. Really great place for quick  cheap  and filling food.
Casa Moreno's,64,A short menu of breakfast plates and generously portioned tacos with a ten minute turnaround in a slow lobby. Wait staff was attentive and knowledgeable. Very good sweet tea. My Suicide breakfast taco was piping hot and made well. Next visit  the lunch buffet 
Casa Moreno's,65,I love the Moreno family and their exthept wish  Meet the restaurant is 5      stars. their new location on river site is also good location  They have the same exact foods awsome food I am to go person.
Casa Moreno's,66,The girls that work here are so sweet. The food is amazing and good prices. Oh did I mention that their tortillas are homemade  So yummy. The tacos are huge and so freakin  good. Love it
Casa Moreno's,67,This is a South Austin classic. The tortillas are homemade and the food is delicious. Go eat at Casa Morenos 
Casa Moreno's,68,Poor customer service. I ll admit the food tastes good. It does. I don t usually write reviews but this interaction was extremely disappointing.  On Tuesdays  my colleagues order breakfast tacos. Every week. I don t always get a taco because I don t enjoy paying for a taco that is 1 2 filled. My colleagues get 3 items- get twice the filling  meaning they get a whole taco  Not just half  for .50-.75 cents less.  I ordered a Nopalitos breakfast taco 2.25  add egg  .95   This is the 3rd time I have been disappointed  first time inquiring about filling. I asked how full a Nopalitos taco was without egg because this one had maybe 6 strands of cactus. The person I spoke to said a spoonful usually filled the taco and that they make the tacos fresh. Neither of those things answered my question.  He asked what I wanted him to do  because they can t do anything unless I bring it in. The taco took like 3 bites to finish- it was that small  it was gone by that point.  I think I would have been happy if they offered a taco.
Casa Moreno's,69,I ve been going to Casa Moreno s for a couple of years now. Surprised this is their first review. Only place in town I know of where you can get Mexican food lunch buffet. Breakfast has usual fare. The staff is always friendly. Love their hot sauce 
Casa Moreno's,70,We r from Fort Worth..Wow  This place deserves more then a 5 Star  The food was awesome n our waitress was so nice n quick.  I would definitely recommend this to everyone  We will be back 
Casa Moreno's,71,Okay  so I have been coming to this place for a few years and I have been forcing myself to give them another try but after today s experience I am certain I will never be back. Casa Moreno s is a different sort of place. I liken the establishment to something in between someone s house and a church reception. When you walk in you may smell an intense bathroom smell  this is real. All of the employees are either children or elderly.   The food leaves a lot to desire. Most of the items on the small buffet are warm though the meat tastes old and microwaved.   I will never eat here again. How can this place stay in business  Service is something that is obviously not very important to this establishment. Often  when I have arrived here I am ignored for a series of several minutes before I am acknowledged and seated. Every single time I have come here  no one has brought me a drink or acknowledged me after I have been seated until I am ready to leave  this means no one has asked if I wanted something to drink or if I needed anything until I am getting up to go pay the check. This place is truthfully gross. I see servers bringing additions to the buffet in old dirty plastic buckets and shoveling it into the buffet trays. I have no idea how this establishment has remained open this long.
Casa Moreno's,72,Do you ever wonder how a place hidden in an industrial area on the south side stays open   LCRA workers   Crowds of them rush in to the place every morning  I imagine  to get their  Suicide Burrito  fix. I started reading the tips and reviews AFTER I had placed my order.  Shoot  I could barely finish one taco.  Props for having papa ranchera  and for the cheap prices.    WTF Moment  Sticky floors  WTF Moment  2  Runny  watery salsa.
Casa Moreno's,73,Excellent local establishment to enjoy a fresh cooked to order breakfast.  The Saturday special is an great value  includes a beverage of choice.  Friendly efficient service.  Our group of nine is all satisfied    Treat yourself.
Casa Moreno's,74,Two words   Suicide Burrito  Cost    3   Nuf said.
Casa Moreno's,75,Pros  Cost  quick  good  homemade  tortillas  Cons  Bland food  sloppy  thrown together  taste and appearance  I made the mistake of ordering two  suicide  tacos  not only was it too much food to finish  my mouth didn t want to continue experiencing it either. I actually scraped out the beans potato egg mush and enjoyed the tortilla more than its  contents.  I would only order from here again if I was starving and had no options other than fast food.
Casa Moreno's,76,I been going there since day one  10 years ago  when they first opened.  The food is good  the services is great and the breakfast is to die for. And if you can t decide what you want for lunch  go for the buffet   You can never go wrong.
Casa Moreno's,77,Congratulations  you have a very ugly Mexican food buffet  except for the beef on gravy ... The chicken fajita looks like gallina vieja and fideo sopa have nothing but carbohydrates in there  good news is that if bum the price of the buffet a few  dollars you can get fresh food and not so cheap stuff like fideo sopa and papas sopes wanna and enchiladas wanna and serve real guisados like mole carne puerko con napalis and menudo .... The place ir clean old but clean place
Casa Moreno's,78,You want soft fluffy huge homemade tortillas and some slamming Mexican food  This is your place   You won t regret it   Oh and don t forget about the lunch buffet   It s a kick
Casa Moreno's,79,Want cheap mexican food this is the place to come. They have a great buffet to select from and the price is great if you are on budget.
Casa Moreno's,80,Very cheap food  big portions too but the food is bland  My breakfast taco had egg shells in it. I gave it a try for lunch and my burger was not cooked all the way through 
Casa Moreno's,81,When your boss walks up to your desk and asks if you want to go to lunch  you say  Yes.  You  don t blink  as the would-be Vice President Sarah  Mooseburger  Palin might say. It s good work PR for yourself  and it s a free meal  That being said  when my boss asks me to go to lunch  it s usually to this dump down the street from our office. I want to like this place-- it s family-owned and the wait staff is sweet  stars number one and two . However  at lunchtime  their claim to fame is a lunch buffet  which isn t any better than Pancho s Mexican Buffet-style  bland weirdness. Also  once when I ordered breakfast tacos  beans and cheese   I got back to my desk with them to discover they weren t what I ordered. I decided to eat them anyway  beans and...ground beef  ew.   and my stomach hated me until the next day.  El Meson is right down the street and runs circles around this place.  Maybe next time the boss asks if I want to go to lunch  I ll take the reins and offer to pay-- and go somewhere else.
Casa Moreno's,82,This morning I had what Casa Moreno s calls a  suicide taco   and I can definitely understand how it got it s name. I think by the end of the day i ll need to schedule a colonoscopy and have heart splints inserted.  Was it flavorful  Not so much  Was it filling  It s been an hour and I can still barely move if that answers your question  The suicide taco is basically a 12 inch flour tortilla filled with egg  cheese  potatoe  bacon  and chorizo for a total weight of a pound when completed.  Aside from the lack of intense flavor or originality like Vics or Torchys  Casa Moreno s does dish up the best value in town.  3 for a pound of food at 8 30am isnt bad at all. Now if they could just find a better salsa and spice up there ingrediants a bit...
Casa Moreno's,83,This was the first time I tried and chose Buffet too bad I didn t see a menu to try their selections. Some people say that they miss  all you can eat  Panchos that was in Austin back before 1994 and a small stint in Round Rock and Oak Hill around 2004.    This restaurant doesn t serve the quantity dedicated to buffet of that establishment but if it did Casa Morenos would run circles around Panchos.   The closest Pancho s from here  west San Antonio  is to taste what the various nasty looking strip malls I avoid stopping at when Iam there.
Casa Moreno's,84,This place is old school.  I am talking gooey cheese enchiladas topped with Chili gravy.  Don  find that too many place any more.  They have a lunch buffet for about  6.  Enchiladas  Carne Guisada  beans  rice  soup  and usually a couple of things that change.  You may try it and think that I am crazy.  That may be true but Casa Moreno makes food like a place I used to frequent 25 years ago before I left the area.  I never thought I would find those tastes again and yet I have.
Casa Moreno's,85,I am giving them a 2 as it was my fault for not opening the bag before I left. Co worker suggested this place as we had never been. I placed an order during lunch for pick as I wanted to get back to work. I got the grilled chicken salad. It was small  did not have cheese or dressing  there was only 3 pieces of bell peppers and one piece of onion I asked for rice and beans to be added and they forgot. The chicken was dry and way over cooked. Next time I am driving the extra 10 min to Cabo bob  s to get a decent salad. My co worker got the chicken enchiladas he said they were meh.
Casa Moreno's,86,After nearly 8 years of being at the top of my go to comfort food  I can honestly say I am walking away. On rare occasions before I have had some minor mishaps with one particular item on the menu  a barbacoba  shredded beef  taco. In Austin it has been really hard to find both a great homemade flour tortilla and yummy barbacoba. In the past when they put more  sebo   grease  than meat  I ve told the owner it s best just to say they don t have any barbacoba. And to give them credit they have apologized and tried to make things right. Don t get me wrong I understand sometimes to make the meat moist you need the sebo but don t make the whole taco of sebo.  Today though was the last straw  I can t believe I was dubbed again  it was the grossest taco of pure  sebo  not meat anywhere. So even though I love the fact that they make my egg white and bean taco  and that their carne guisada is yummy more than 90  of the time  I m sad to say my search for my go to place will start again.  This is the place I recommend to family and friends  the first place I would think of when people wanted homemade tortillas but after those bits of sebo today when I was expecting a meaty barbacoba taco and feeling my stomach turn I don t really have a choice.
Casa Moreno's,87,Stopped and got some tacos the other morning I thought they where great  Home made corn and flour tortillas great hot Sauce. Can t wait to try more food here  Also I talked to a lady I think she s the owner she was very nice and a pleasure to talk to.
Casa Moreno's,88,Sadly this place has gone WAY downhill.  I went here a little over a month ago with some coworkers and we left feeling unsatisfied.  The food was bland and had no flavor and the service was terrible.  It seems like every time you go to this place the owners have someone different working there and is always seems to be grandchildren or some form of family members.  Makes you feel like you re eating in someone s house the way they act  and not in a good way. There were young adults just hanging out at a few tables and then it was obvious that they were somehow related to the owners and at one point one of them got up to work the cash register but everyone seemed like they didn t even notice the customers  they were in their own world and we couldn t get refills or help.  I thought I d give the place another chance  I mean where else can you find a Mexican buffet around here  right   Well I REALLY should have turned around when I walked in an aroma hit me in the face that smelled like I had walked into a dirty night club restroom.  I thought  well the restroom hall is right there  Still gross and we should have left now that I experienced the food I realize this.  The chicken fajitas were old  cold  rubbery and had that nasty over-microwaved meat taste.  The enchiladas were bland and the edges of the tortilla were so hard you couldn t cut through hem with a fork let along chew with your teeth.  There was one mini chalupa on the buffet and all it s toppings were sadly scattered throughout the pan.  The fidello was nothing but liquid....I could keep going and going but bottom line  I have sadly given up on this place and decided that it is not worth it anymore.  Another thing I noticed  this place used to be packed at the time that I went  today it was just us and two other people.  I think other people are noticing their decline.
Casa Moreno's,89,Excited for a co-worker to bring me a giant breakfast taco this morning from Moreno s. The homemade flour tortilla was huge  fluffy and delicious  Salsa was pleasantly spicy and flavorful. I did not eat much of the inside of the taco because co-worker got bacon and I am sans meat for the time being  but it was packed. A great deal for anyone with a big appetite on a small budget. I look forward to going here on my own and ordering for myself so I can get the full experience.
Casa Moreno's,90,I hate to say it  but this place doesn t live up to my expectations. The service is great. The lady at the cashier is always a sweetheart...I think she s the owner   But the food...the food is just not  teh awesome . It s good for a cheap  filling meal. I have been in a few times with a friend who loves it. I just don t find the breakfast tacos all that good. If I want cheap breakfast tacos  I ll go to that other place whose name escapes me now. sigh. It sucks to get old and have your brain go on holiday without you   So it s edible but nothing to get excited about. I gave it an extra star for the nice servers.
Casa Moreno's,91,Food is blah and it compliments the awful service. DON T GO HERE there are better places to eat where customer service is held high.
Casa Moreno's,92,Decent lunch buffet. Just very low on food  and some refills took a bit. Quality was ok. Chicken mole felt bland to me  but somebody else may love it that way. Cost   8 - a good deal. Restaurant was full but not overcrowded. Wait staff friendly but not terribly fast. Good choice for a regular lunch.
Casa Moreno's,93,Family owned  wonderful staff of nice people and the food is soo good  Breakfast specials or a suicide taco for breakfast is a win or stay for the 11am buffet super good. Love tues. its mole  day   
Casa Moreno's,94,Some of the best breakfast tacos I have ever eaten    The tortillas are delicious and the size of the tacos will leave you full and satisfied.  I ordered the barbacoa taco and wasn t too impressed by it.  The taste was good but not a good amount of meat and kind of greasy.   I recommend the bacon egg and cheese tacos.
Casa Moreno's,95,The lunch buffet is only 7 . Which is a great price. However the food doesn t have a lot favor but it s not bad and nor great at the same time. The customer service needs to better. They put name tags of the waitress on the table  I never seen this before but she still didn t attend to the table. I ll give this place another shot in a couple weeks.
Casa Moreno's,96,No thanks to the buffet and we will mark it off our list. The enchiladas were so hard they couldn t be cut with a knife. Meat for carne guisa was very fatty and in a water sauce. Chips weren t refilled. Options are super limited. I mean  no queso or tacos fixings.
Casa Moreno's,97,It took 40  minutes to get my food and the waiter never came to check in and just let us know that it was going to be a little while. There were several tables open so I was not anticipating that long of a wait.  But the best part was when I received my food it was not even cooked they had to take it back for an even longer time.  If they would have been apologetic or just kept me informed it would have been okay they did everything they could to avoid the situation. It was not even good after I finally got to eat it because it was soggy and cold 
Casa Moreno's,98,I m not sure what Lindsay C.  the previous reviewer  was expecting from a mexican restaurant that s open only for breakfast and lunch  in a commercial strip  on a commercial road  where the closest standard lunch option is McD s  but I got exactly what I was looking for at Casa Moreno s.  Driving by to work  I d always seen the Lunch Buffet sign  and of course my curiosity was piqued. I d never really seen a mexican lunch buffet pulled off effectively  but in this neighborhood an eatery isn t going to stay open long if they aren t serving an edible meal -- and there is always some traffic there at lunchtime.  The occasion arose where my boss was out for the day  so I planned on taking an out-of-office lunch.  I went by myself in case the food actually was terrible or the service was painfully slow  as not to inflict these trials on another.  I was pleasantly greeted when I came in and there were several still having lunch at about 12 45.  I was asked if I wanted a menu  or if I was having buffet.  I took a look at the buffet first and all appeared appetizing  so I let the waitress know I wanted a sweet tea and grabbed a buffet plate.  The cooking was what I would label traditional mexican style.  That means that there s going to be some fat on the meat  the beans aren t going to be vegan  and there s going to be onions seasoning most everything.  The buffet food seemed to me to be exactly what you would get if you ordered it off the menu  i.e. the beans weren t crusty  the rice wasn t dry  everything was very flavorful and hot.  I really enjoyed the carne guisada over some rice tucked in  what appeared to be  a homemade flour tortilla.  From the buffet  the rice was yummy  amp  fluffy  and the chicken fajitas were nicely spiced  too.  I placed some chicken meat  no  not strictly white pristine breast meat  on my mini chalupa  tostada if you re white-bread  and ate up.  I do have one bit of thumbs down  as the sauce brought with the chips was quite thin.  I asked for some pico de gallo  which was promptly brought and obviously fresh  stirred it in and had a nice salsa.  The chips are super fresh  but thankfully not greasy  as some cooked on-site chips are presented elsewhere.  The service was no-nonsense  but attentive with a pleasant smile.  The ladies let you do your own thing  but are there if you need a little extra attention.  There were several city employees lunching  since there are city buildings in the area  and multiple truck drivers stopped in who went directly to the buffet to pile up a hot plate.  I m sure they re thankful to have an option of an all-they-care-to-eat hot traditional meal with a refreshing glass of tea for just a little more than they d spend at the drive-thru.  Lunch served 11-2.  p.s. I haven t experience El Mason down the street  but I m a bit wary that they rarely have any obvious traffic.
Casa Moreno's,99,It s a friendly place.  There s usually good music playing  and their lunch buffet is pretty solid on MWF  Tuesdays and Thursdays the centerpiece is a chicken  amp  vegetable stew that just isn t that filling  but the rest of the week there s some good variety of fajitas .  The Mexican rice and borracho beans are consistently excellent  and they have some of the best tortillas around.  Some of it is a little bland  and sometimes on busy days the buffet is a little overextended and stuff seems a little undercooked.  So I can see why someone might have a bad experience there  but for me it s worth a regular visit.  They also have a good cheeseburger  amp  fries if you re not up for Mexican food but somehow ended up in there anyway.
Casa Moreno's,100,myself and some co-workers have been ordering tacos form here about once every week. we called in our order this morning  about 20 tacos  and sent a guy out to pick them up. when he got there he was turned away because they don t take separate orders any longer. that is a over  100 worth of business that they have lost  and we will not be ordering from them from here on out. if you want to place a separate order  go somewhere else. this place will turn you away.
Casa Moreno's,101,We stopped in  here for breakfast. The breakfast plates are tasty and offer plenty of food for even a big appetite.  The service was quick and courteous. This is a nice find.
Casa Moreno's,102,This place is about his rundown of a hole in the wall that you will ever find    6.50 lunch buffet but looks like smallest buffet in the world  we ordered off the main menu  I was a bit shocked and I received my fajitas and they were made of thigh meat that looked like it was dried out the day before microwaved  we had to request beverage refills as none were offered we had to get up and grab her own the silverware as our table was not set we sat down and to top it off while rushing to go to the bathroom and poop the horrible food out I was a bit taken aback by the fact that there was no toilet paper. Lol  all in all there are several Mexican choices in this area including a food truck I must say Casa Marina is likely the worst choice in the area please don t waste your time or money going into this dive  not trying to be rude but my god horrible service  horrible food  horrible dirty environment  horrible experience and I do not give 1 stars out lately but this place probably didn t even earn one star. Lol save your money go to the taco truck down the street it s probably a little bit more sanitized
Casa Moreno's,103,I went years ago and didn t like it then. I don t know how my friends convinced me to go today. But I did. Once again. Horrible service. They have a buffet going on at a certain time of the day. We arrived during that time. It took 10 minutes for me to get my tea. My friends arrived before me. I opted out of the buffet that everyone seemed to be getting. I myself am not fan of ANY buffets. I feel if I m going out to eat my food should be cooked to order for ME     The salsa was soooo bland.  I only ordered one breakfast taco. The tortilla was so thick and hard. My friend ordered a suicide taco. Which seemed to miss the bacon. Once we brought it up to the waitress she went back to tell the cook. Comes back and says the cook said it was in there. We fork through the taco and a whopping two tiny pieces of bacon were there hidden. We laughed. Not a good laugh. So the waitress went back and brought my friend a little bowl with tiny pieces of bacon to add to his taco. I PERSONALLY WILL NEVER GO BACK   Good luck to all that do
Casa Moreno's,104,As I walked in  there was a foul odor....It smelt like it was old and moldy.  I figured the building was just old so I ordered 2 chicken fajita tacos on corn tortillas.  I will NEVER go back....no flavor to the chicken what so ever  it was bland and the tortillas smelt like some kind of cleaner.  I think they should find a cleaner place and hire better cooks  maybe then it will be better.  The cooks need to taste their food before serving.
Casa Moreno's,105,The only good thing I can say about this place is the decent size portions. Breakfast tacos are huge. Finally went in to dine for lunch. Customer services was okay. The food  not so great. Really bland. Probably won t go back.
Casa Moreno's,106,This is the palce to get one of the best tacos in town for 3.00 you can t beet this place.
Casa Moreno's,107,If you want a damn good taco for a great price  this is the place. I read the other reviews and feel some people might be more picky than I. I eat breakfast tacos everyday for the most part and this place serves big tacos that fill you up.  The service was great and the owner  Angie  greeted us at the door. She is super nice and I will be going back for more suicide tacos. I added chorizo to mine which made it even better.
Casa Moreno's,108,Their food is great. However  any food on their buffet is not available to purchase for take out. Never heard of this before. Also  you are not allowed to sub refried beans for charro on their plates. Really  They need to learn how to please their customers.
Casa Moreno's,109,Their potato  egg  and cheese breakfast tacos were HUGE for the very reasonable price.  I can usually eat two breakfast tacos and was stuffed after one of theirs.  The taste was ok  a little skimpy on the cheese  but definitely a great value for the money.
Casa Moreno's,110,Their breakfast taco s are just ok.  Flavor is very bland and usually cold.  The place is close to my work so it is easy to stop in and get breakfast.  They just recently raised the price again on there breakfast taco.  The price is not worth it  especially when the food is so bland.  I also had there buffet for lunch and the experience was even worse.  Again  bland food and it  taste like the cheapest of ingredients were used.  More importantly some of the cooked items are cold  Hello Food Inspector .  I will most likely have to find a new place for Mexican food fix.  Just not worth it anymore.
Casa Moreno's,111,My experience here was horrible  I took my food to go. I went for breakfast and ordered a breakfast burrito  it had egg shells in it which I was willing to look past but then I bit into something hard and it was a hard black piece of plastic  could have broken my filling   like maybe a piece of a cooking utensil. I had enough by then so I called the restaurant only to be hung up on  accidentally  on several occasions. I usually like  hole in the wall   Mexican restaurants but I DON T recommend casa moreno s
Casa Moreno's,112,I m going to go for the obvious as everyone else has pointed out- suicide burrito. The flavor isn t 5 star or anything worth getting excited for  but for the size and price you can t complain a whole lot. I tend to have an alarmingly large appetite  but one of these  prefer mine without the beans  can shut my stomach up well into lunchtime. The past 2 times I ve been here  I have been slightly disappointed though- I absolutely love their salsa  and though I ask for extra each time and it is written down  it is still forgotten. The time before last I even checked my bag before I left and asked if I could have one more- I waited for 10 minutes while she ran to grab one for me but she never came back. If it was busy I would be more then understanding  but there was one other person in the entire restaurant besides me. Service in the morning is ehhhh  would like to give their lunch buffet a try some day. I recommend this place over El Meson down the street...but I am still on the hunt for a truly fantastic hole in the wall joint.
Casa Moreno's,113,Pretty bland tacos  but they are cheap and filling. The suicide taco is my regular. Can t beat it for the price.
Casa Moreno's,114,Love this place. Had a  suicide  taco and let me tell ya it sure was damn good. It reminds me of the hole in the wall restraints in San Antonio and that suicide taco is like three quarters of a pound and its only like 2.75. Check this place out its right by cat fish parlor off of ben white then exit ed burleson rd and it will be on your left
Taqueria Jefes,1,Los Mejores Tacos de Austin   This are without a doubt the BEST tacos i have had in Austin so ever  the ladies that run the place are very nice and make delicious food. This tacos are so good im going to go get some right now just for thinking about them.. Carnitas y tripas son mis favoritos....
Taqueria Jefes,2,This is by far one of the tastiest taco place I ve been in Austin. Quesadilla is also very good. There is one thing I didn t like much and that is the burrito add-ons.. there are none. A burrito has only  choice of meat  beans. No sour cream  lettuce  rice or fries.   So quality of the food is amazing but maybe more ingredients should be added for a better food experience. In a way I feel like what I didn t like is because of expectations... and when you have expectations you will be disappointed    all the places around have rice  cheese  guacamole etc in their burrito  maybe if this was my first burrito ever I would ve not been disappointed about it cause man it was tasty     Try it out and review it  I m looking forward to seeing more opinions about it.  Ps my previous review is a mistake  that was for a different taqueria. Sorry for that.
Taqueria Jefes,3,Absolutely integral component of South Austin.  Margie keeps the tacos coming and the smiles are abundant.  This is the best late night taco truck in ALL of Austin     Is it Westlake foodie friendly  At 1 am   ...damn straight.
Taqueria Jefes,4,Awesome place with awesome prices  Highly recommend their hotdog  has bacon and a bunch of toppings  and their order of street tacos 
Taqueria Jefes,5,This place is terrible   I should have went to my guys at  Taqueria La Esperanza  on S. Congress. I mean this Jefes Taqueria is way below the bar when it comes to Austin food truck taco standards.   I ordered 4 Fajita Tacos and 1 Quesadilla to be split between a friend and I. The tacos were very small. Think street taco sizes. They charged me  26 for that. I mean what a rip off  right  The gentleman at the window told me it comes with cilantro and onions and asked if that was okay. I asked him if they had lettuce  tomatoes  amp  cheese instead and he said okay. All the while the lady making my food was giving me these weird looks.   Anyways  the guy that took my order ended up charging me extra over a  1 more per item  about  5  and the lady didn t even put cheese on the fajitas.  He didn t even tell me he was charging me extra  just went ahead and did it . The quesadilla in the pic on their menu shows it having sour cream  guac  lettuce  amp  pico. Except when I got it it only had just a few bits of chicken and mainly cheese and the tortilla. That s it  Not to mention nothing tasted very good. Everything was too salty and dry. Also  everything was very bland when it came to the seasonings.   I asked for extra salsa and the guy told me he would hook me up. Probably cuz I gave them a decent cash tip in their plastic tip jar. He gives me 2 small bags a little bigger than the size of my thumb with one green  amp  one red salsa. That s it  Bags that were like thin  flimsy sandwich bags mind you. They were tied in an awkward tight knot so I couldn t even use them without risking having to pop them and spill them everywhere. Do those small plastic ramikens really cost that much my dude   Pretty sure you could get them from costco for a great deal and end up pleasing your customers so they can be happy and come back for more bro    Well  at least now I know not to get tempted and stop here ever again  Lesson learned. It s back to my favorite spot Taqueria La Esperanza on S. Congress where the tacos are twice the size  taste a hundred times better and they won t be stingy on the accessories  amp  condiments 
Taqueria Jefes,6,Great service  Fantastic burritos  amp  tacos. Decently priced too which is hard to find. The only thing that can be a pain is parking around the car wash if it s busy. You can park next door and walk if it s busy and I suggest it because I ve been blocked in before and couldn t get out.
Taqueria Jefes,7,Staff was really nice  amazing burritos and tacos and love that it s open late night. Definitely authentic and delicious. Thanks for being here 
Taqueria Jefes,8,Good tacos all around for the price. Salsa comes in a baggy. Just note it is cash only
Taqueria Jefes,9,I just bought in the neighborhood across the street and saw the folks lining up at night and had to swing by and check out the food. I had the chicken tacos and a quesadilla on my first trip. Tacos were simple but good and the quesadilla was excellent. Plenty of cheese and meat. I m a sauce salsa snob and the green and red sauce here is on point. Service is friendly and fast. Bring cash. I ll be back regularly.
Taqueria Jefes,10,Favorite taco truck in Austin. The gringas are amazing. Staff always has a great recommendation for trying something new. Great late night spot
Taqueria Jefes,11,This taco truck is part of the north Austin chain of Jefes  but manages to have higher quality tacos than the others. Perhaps it s because one of the owners actually mans this roach coach. Or maybe because it s a stone s throw from a Tejano club.   Regardless  it s a solid choice for late night weekend tacos around the Ben White area. Somehow I missed this truck for the year it has been open. Clearly  I need to brush up on my taco stalking skills.
Taqueria Jefes,12,This place never fails to deliver on great food  From burritos to nachos to tacos y mas  Closed Monday and Tuesday  everyday is 7pm to 3am  but Sunday  closes at noon. Only downfall is that it s cash only  but after the first time I ve been pulling cash out just to get my fix 
Taqueria Jefes,13,Excellent service and delicious tacos  The green sauce is amazing. Just remember to bring your cash 
Taqueria Jefes,14,Just wanted to let you know that you have the best tacos in town. I ve been coming to y all for years and you guys are always so friendly
Taqueria Jefes,15,This is one of the best kept secrets for locals. Authentic mexican food cooked in a trailer by a legitimate mexican grandma  Only open evening and late but the quality of food is absolutely amazing.  Make sure to get the pickled carrots and cabbage and green sauce with EVERYTHING  Reasonably priced and they even treat this gringo like I m one of their own. Authentic pastor  suadero  chicharones. My go to spot on way home from a good night out.  Only knock on them and it s minor is that they only accept cash  why its 4 stars not 5  but are trusting enough to take your order and let you run to grab cash as your order is being redy. This is uncommon for a busy food truck
Taqueria Jefes,16,Absolutely solid place to go for a late night meal.  I ve never been disappointed here with anything I get  and I ve gotten everything on the menu.  Wish they were open 24 7 cause I d probably eat here every day.
Taqueria Jefes,17,Delicious  inexpensive  amp  fast. The ingredients were fresh  amp  the women working were very nice 
Taqueria Jefes,18,After a night out  the hubby and I wanted some tacos. We ve passed by this place plenty of times on our way home and figured we would try it out. By far  the best al pastor tacos I ve had hands down. The tortillas were also amazing. If you want something a bit different  I d say try the hot dogs.. They were crazy good too. Be sure to take cash as they do not take cards 
Taqueria Jefes,19,Bistec  Carnitas  al Pastor and all their delicious Mexican friends come out after dark in front of a detail shop.  Try this place out on your way home and you won t be disappointed. We had a few tacos and a Gringa but will be back for the tortas and gorditas.
Taco Shack,1,Simple great tasting breakfast tacos. Almost always get sausage and egg or potato and egg. Have had the migas taco and it was good too.
Taco Shack,2,With Torchy s down the street... Need to step up your game  ORLANDO    Always loyal to TS but today all my tacos were so cold  
Taco Shack,3,I m a regular here  but gotta say service has really plummeted in the last year. Pretty consistently bad--my order is almost always incorrect  and the folks behind the counter are no longer the jovial bunch I once knew. Bad attitudes all around and no sense of urgency. Morale seems pretty low at the establishment. Love me some Taco Shack  and the tacos are tasty   but no longer frequenting this place.
Taco Shack,4,Half my to go order was missing and the manager hung up on me when I called to inform them of this.
Taco Shack,5,Not the first time I ve been to this location and my order was wrong. Stupid me for not checking it before I left. Paid for 2  4 item tacos and got 2  3 item tacos -no bacon   
Taco Shack,6,A good  inexpensive  reliable  take-out only  place for basic breakfast tacos and standard traditional Tex-Mex for lunch. The service is friendly and brisk  and it doesn t hurt that the kitchen is open for all to see and always looks very clean. I like the catfish tacos and the cheese enchilada plate.  The barbacoa beef tacos are also quite good.
Taco Shack,7,At their request I did reach out to them directly  first by phone  voicemail  and then via their contact page. No reply. Tacodeli is awesome 
Taco Shack,8,I called and placed a order it was not ready at the time I asked for and I was late. The guy that answered the phone was rude and when I got there he was at the desk and was rude still. If I could give 0 stars I would.
Taco Shack,9, 11.63 for two tacos and a drink. I ve never paid that for a breakfast taco and won t start now. No thank you.
Taco Shack,10,Love Taco Shack  but not enough to risk COVID19.  Cashiers  who are most exposed to the most people  wear their masks so they just barely cover their mouths. asked each time  for their own safety if not for safety of customers  to please cover nose and mouth with the mask. All I got was snarky looks.  Management should step up and ensure that employees and customers are protected as much as practical.   Love the tacos  but not willing to die for one.
Taco Shack,11,DON T WASTE YOUR MONEY OR RISK GETTING FOOD POISONING      Tacos were served at room temperature  and were inedible. The amount of grease was absurd. There are many great tacos places in Austin...don t waste your time  money  or health here.  -  Taco Shack - There are enough negative reviews that it s clear this location needs a fundamental overhaul of kitchen operations. Apologies and forwarding guests to a generic contact form seems to be a waste of time. No action was taken previously  why would I expect leaving my contact information in a generic form to be better  When your reviews are this bad  consistently  below is the response a franchise should make      We are closing down our store and are dedicating an entire day to train our team on food safety  preparation and presentation. On Saturday January XX we invite you to join us and our executive chef first name  last name at our Spicewood location as s he unveils our revamped menu that is sure to surprise and delight. If you join us  and you do not absolutely love your TacoShack experience  your tacos are on us 
Taco Shack,12,Taco Shack Spicewood Springs Austin tx.  The worst customer service I have ever had. The whole staff was not friendly.  Down right made me and my coworker uncomfortable.  They need to go visit the one on Lamar with Freddie.  He knows how to treat customers.  Get a better attitude and treat your customers better.
Taco Shack,13,I hit this place 3-4 times a week  for over a year  and their tacos have always been good. I call in on my drive in and it s waiting for me when I get there. Today I called 33 times and never got through. I asked who was answering the phones and the cashier said they had a large order and a line out the door and were told not to answer the phones this morning. If you could put this info on your answering machine message  I could save a lot of time and just take my business elsewhere like I plan to for the next month...
Taco Shack,14,Austin has a lot of taco options. Trust me  Taco Shack shouldn t be your first option  especially when the best thing I had there was the iced tea.  I ve lived in the neighborhood for over 30 years and have been to Taco Shack less than five times.  I thought maybe it was because the seating insider was limited  with less than six stools at a counter. After this morning  I remember why.  It s the food  prices  and service that make me not want to come back.  The food.  I ordered two Lone Star tacos  their term for a plain beef fajita taco   breakfast potatoes  and an iced tea. The fajita meat was meh at best.  The meat at chains like Taco Cabana  Rosa s  and even Taco Bell  at least their steak tacos  has more seasoning and pizzazz. The salsa was pedestrian at best and also lacked heat.  People  this is Texas.  I expect my salsa to remind me of that fact.  The breakfast potatoes were nowhere near cooked enough.  Underdone potatoes  whether deep fried or skillet fried  are not appetizing to say the least. The iced tea was truly the star of the meal with decent slices of lemon available.  I d give it a 2 star review except for two other things.  The service that was about as friendly as visiting an IRS office staffed by Post Office employees and the price.  For a large tea  two flavorless tacos  and a side of undercooked potatoes  I paid 12 dollars and change.  I could ve paid significantly less for significantly better food from a chain -- or one of the many amazing local taco options here in town.  I just don t get how this place has become an institution for providing flavorless food at high prices with disinterested service.  Here s the TL DR version.  Paying good money for bad tacos is wrong.
Taco Shack,15,We ve been going to Taco Shack since it opened. We ve seen it through multiple management and staff changes but they always maintained a consistent level of friendly service and good food...until now. They completely turned over there food prep team and it has severely impacted every aspect of the product they serve. We used to go multiple times a week for breakfast tacos and they have not got one single order right for the past 4 weeks.  Add to the inconsistency of getting the order right  the servings are chintzy  quality has suffered  and condiments are often missing. We ve even called to offer constructive feedback  always with a positive tone  because this is a beloved restaurant and we want them to succeed. But after so many failed attempts - we give up and will no longer be a regular customer. Makes me sad.
Taco Shack,16,Two thumbs up.  The Shack taco is a must have.  It s so big  I only need one.  Good service and lots of outdoor seating.
Taco Shack,17,All I wanted was tacos. Ordered three  got two. I was wondering why it was only seven dollars for three.   Yep  they started selling these three fifty tacos about a year ago. One reason shy I barley stop by any more. Fleecing the suburbs with average tacos for three bucks.  If only Kens Tacos was in our area.   But I digress  two tacos when three ordered. And  mine was not even warm.  You can only half ass a taco so much  but they nailed that part.
Taco Shack,18,Can t believe all customers are waiting for our individual orders while they fill a giant order.  They used to care about the waking too 
Taco Shack,19,We have totally given up on this Taco Shack Shame on us we keep going back because they re close and we think the next time will be better   Breakfast taco full of egg shells for the last time  Not going back   
Taco Shack,20,I just had their Chorizo and Egg shack taco and EWWWWWW  wth  it was awful    The eggs weren t cooked and the Chorizo  it didn t cook right and it tasted  JUST WRONG     Not sure what kind of chorizo sausage that was but it looked like grounded cat food and it tasted very very strange   I had to rush to nearby Starbucks to get rid of that disgusting taste    Don t eat here  the one on West Parmer Ln tasted way way better  
Taco Shack,21,I love  LOVE  the carne guisada taco on flour with avocado and cheese added. The classic breakfast tacos  such as potatoe egg and cheese are tried and true. The staff is nice and the wait is super short when they re slow and never too long when they re slammed. There isn t really seating inside - they have a bar you can eat at if you don t mind people hovering over you waiting for to-go orders. Outside seating is nice but limited. They have a pretty neat and massive outdoor patio umbrella. There s also a little fountain you can sit on the edge of  but it s kind of old and lacks in visual appeal. So if you re grabbing a taco to-go and want the best carne guisada north of the Rio Grande Valley  this is your place 
Taco Shack,22,We had a very bad experience here a week ago.  The cashier was seriously rude.  But I wrote a comment on the Taco Shack website.  Hesitantly  this morning we went back.  There was a different person at the cash register  a very friendly young woman  who had been there last week and recognized me today.   Amazing in itself  given we were all wearing masks.    She volunteered an apology for what had happened last week.  She said that my comment had been read and taken seriously.  And she said that I wouldn t have to deal with the rude woman again.
Taco Shack,23,Have not been here in about a year was a weekly customer I had ordered  2 egg tacos  amp  one migas.  amp   said please no hot peppers.             Waited on other side for tacos  amp   cook said its all mixed in jalape o cannot be taken out  so I said just an egg taco instead to replace taco.             Got in my car  amp   only 2 tacos were in bag took a bite of one hardly even warm  other taco the same so in the trash they went.          I watched the cooks  amp  lg container of cooked eggs being scooped into tacos   cheese was not even melted.  It is not just your restaurant I think since the pandemic many placed are skipping quality.         Not your place but well known taco place up the road had flys inside  another the potatoes are not even cooked   amp  another had so much dirt under register.   Your place is clean         Should not be hard to get hot eggs  amp  requesting well done bacon   amp  being told we can look through pile   amp  it was not cooked well done. Why the bacon cannot be placed on grill for a couple of minutes more.       Our Family had 3 successful restaurants  amp  we bend over backwards to make a customer happy.  Maybe because your place was not that busy   amp  they made more eggs then needed
Taco Shack,24,Had to be up north for the day  so I was looking for some breakfast tacos and hadn t been to a Taco Shack in a long time. It was pretty bad. Ordered a bacon  egg  amp  cheese for the toddler. The eggs were runny. A BEC taco shouldn t drip. I was trying to decide between the atx and the barbacoa. I asked if the barbacoa was lean and the guy said   it s just ok  I d go with the atx . So I did. The atx is brisket  which had big chunks of fat and veins  and runny eggs. After pulling off the fat  the brisket that was left was dry and not anything special. Flour tortillas were just average and the eggs  besides being runny  weren t seasoned at all. Definitely won t be back. Or maybe I ll come back in a few more years after I forget they aren t that great.
Taco Shack,25,2 out of the 4 cooks were not wearing their masks properly  they were around their chins  not safe  
Taco Shack,26,I ve come here for years because I live nearby.  I know the owner from his days keeping up the fields at Northwest Little League.  These days we re remodeling  so I always get a Shack Pack for the construction crew.  One of the workers at Taco Shack was rude to me this morning.  I always ask for green sauce and I was shocked and embarrassed when he created a scene.  Apparently it is a bother to him to turn around and put two green sauce containers in my sack of tacos.  I won t be coming back.    UPDATE  I m getting tacos at the trailer in the parking lot of the convenience store at Steck and Mesa just a few blocks away.  They are cheaper  taste like real Latino tacos  are prepared just as fast and have no egg shells in them.  I can t believe I ate those tasteless tacos at Taco Shack all those years.
Taco Shack,27,Today for lunch we headed to the taco shack  had a chicken tortilla soup which had a bunch of mixed veggies and and excessive amount of cheese. Don t get me wrong I love cheese just not the entire soup bowl having cheese. It was quite thick and the chicken tasted like that fake chicken. I wouldn t give this the worst rating but certainly not anything more than a 3 star. It was mediocore at best. I would possibly give this place a second chance.
Taco Shack,28,Rude service  bad tacos.  Every time I go I m disappointed and wish I chose somewhere else. Will never go back. Don t waste your time or money here.
Taco Shack,29,Great breakfast tacos  some of my favorite in Austin. Also really good coffee
Taco Shack,30,I just went here and ordered 3 ground beef tacos. They were out of taco meat. How can the taco shack be out of taco meat    SMH
Taco Shack,31,Owner contacted me and asked me to write to him and he d rectify the situation. I did. About 3 or more months ago.  Nothing. No reply. No anything. Adios Shack.  It was good white it lasted.  Maybe I ll come back when the place is managed better. Like it once was.
Taco Shack,32,5 stars for a normal breakfast  can t comment on anything else.   Ok  so I m an instant instant fan of places that serve thick  crispy bacon. My go-to breakfast isn t tacos so I didn t have this restaurant on my radar... but I ended up eating a catered breakfast that had a variety of tacos from here and was intrigued by their thick  crispy bacon. I feel let down when I eat flabby ones.  So far I ve only gone to this location once and I have no complaints. The lady running the cash register was nice and smiley  which I very much enjoy at 7 am  and the burrito I got  Burnet Road burrito  came out quick. Bacon still crunchy. I probably wouldn t ever come here for a non-breakfast taco  since nothing really appeals to me  but if I m craving a breakfast taco and I m in the area I d come back. I m content.
Taco Shack,33,I was excited as taco shack is in walking distances from my condo.  The barbacoa was greasy.   Dipping off the tortilla.   The beans didn t really have much flavor.  I can t eat eggs  so my breakfast choices are limited.  I would rather drive somewhere that have more options.    Not a bad choice for cheap tacos...just not my cup of tea.
Taco Shack,34,My husband and I stopped in on a Sunday morning.  I guess they only serve breakfast tacos on the weekend so we ordered some shack tacos and a Mia s Migas taco.    The tacos were decent but could use some additional spices.  The salsa they provide does help but there was just a little something missing.  Service was friendly and it was a much shorter wait than Torchy s.  I d be interested to see what the lunch tacos are like.
Taco Shack,35,I m fond of saying that the sign of a place s quality isn t when everything is going well  it s when things go wrong where businesses really shine or suck. I came in on a busy Friday morning having placed a sizable takeout order. Unfortunately my order wasn t ready when I had requested. I waited for about 10 minutes and when they brought me my order  not only did they apologize  they also threw in free extra tacos. I didn t make a fuss or show signs of displeasure so it was literally the staff here recognizing that they had a service fault and they automatically took care of the situation.  I genuinely appreciate when businesses do that. Thanks y all for being awesome.
Taco Shack,36,Great simple breakfast items.  Fairly quick and they have great prices.   I go for the Burnet Rd burrito and beans and avocado 
Taco Shack,37,Checked this place out the other day with two other people  around 10 40am. I ordered the nachos and they said they had to double-check whether the beef was ready since they normally only serve lunch after 11am. It was ready so I put my order in for the nachos and requested no jalapenos.    They took a really long time  by the time I got my order the other two people I was with had finished eating their meals completely. I can appreciate that they may have had to warm up the oven or something but that still really sucked.   In short the nachos just weren t very good  minimal flavor and they did give me jalapenos which i had to pick out..plus I got some attitude from the woman who served them to me.  In summary the food was very  meh  and I was quite disappointed with the whole experience.   Would not go back especially when there are so many other good options for tacos in the area 
Taco Shack,38,Love this place. The breakfast tacos are always AMAZING  service is crazy fast  and the coffee is surprisingly good for a taco joint... really. Don t come if you want to lose weight though.   
Taco Shack,39,Fast and cheap. Their breakfast tacos are delicious with lots of items to choose from. Made after ordered  doesn t compare to other places selling premade ones under heat lamps for same price point. They really fill the tacos  so definitely not the petite torchy size. Their lunch is good too. The dollar something crispy taco is filled to the brim  and actually a good amount of food for the price.   One thing that brought rating down is quality of tortilla. I do eat my tacos there now  no problem as it doesn t take that long to eat a taco or two  but when taking somewhere else  the crispy taco shells always break and or get soggy. The flour tortillas get soggy as well  so because of the thinner less quality tortillas they changed to  this never happened before  and always happens past few years   I do frequent bit less. If having enchiladas  no worries. Also  their tacos are filled out  yay   but their queso is really small for the price  waaah . Still a good one to keep in the mix  esp on a weekend morning    For the most part  everyone there has been friendly and helpful and fast. All this taco writing is making me hungry  
Taco Shack,40,I really love the breakfast tacos here  They are yummy    I only have two hang ups about this location... 1.  They don t  wear gloves when making the tacos and their hands go in and out of the food. I had a little bean thumb print on my potato and egg taco.   2.  Some cashiers here seem to really hate being there  they rarely smile even when you are being pleasant with them. It s a little off putting.  I wish that those two concerns would be addressed because I really do think the food is great 
Taco Shack,41,After returning from a trip to Hawaii I was Jonesing for some good Tex-Mex and stopped in to the Taco Shack.  I know I know  I should have rushed home to see my two dogs and spring my cat from the local vet where I boarded him.  Why board a cat you ask   In short  he cant be trusted. When left to his own devises he terrorizes and attacks my dogs and god only knows what he would do to the pet sitter.  Back to the Shack.  I ordered 2 Cheese Enchiladas  Rice and Beans  extra Onions and fresh Jalapenos please. Food came out hot  tasty and oh so delicious. There is a small dine in area and a good size outside dinning area complete with shade umbrellas and palm trees.  The Shack has several locations all of which are consistently good  convenient and affordable.
Taco Shack,42,Overall  3.5 stars but bumping it up to 4 for this specific location for serving breakfast til 1pm. YES   3 stars for most of the items on their lunch menu. Portions are a bit small for what you re paying compared to other places.   4 stars for most breakfast items.   4 stars for that one item on the menu that I come back for  the Burnet Burrito. Love the big gigantic breakfast burrito- full of all my favorite things  eggs  potatoes  2 slices of thick bacon  and shredded cheddar cheese.   Unlike others  I actually like their red salsa. It has just the right amount of kick. I always ask for extra  they only give you 2 tiny cups    . Yes  you HAVE to ask for the extra  annoying  right     This location has a cute patio with a few tables  amp  a fountain. Good option for breakfast on a nice day 
Taco Shack,43,Meh. I decided to get a burrito for lunch from somewhere other than Chipotle  which is right next to where I work   I was very disappointed with the shack burrito. The burrito was bland and lacked any spice  it also wasn t exactly hot. The two tiny cups of salsa they gave with the burrito had zero flavor as well. I gave two stars instead of 1 because the service was quick.
Taco Shack,44,One of the worst dining experiences I ve ever had. The food I got fell apart and wasn t wrapped properly. Flavor was totally lacking. My girlfriends food tasted strange and old. Didnt even look day old fresh. But all of that wouldn t merit my giving a review. Normally I d just brush off a bad experience but what got me is that my food was made with BARE hands. Neither of the ladies wore gloves and they stuck their hands in the cheese  the lettuce  and other ingredients. This isnt your mama s kitchen  ladies. Its a restaurant. Its on American soil. There are sanitation laws. I would report them for violating safety standards but I hear they re going out of business anyway so it s not even worth the effort.
Taco Shack,45,Taco Shack is to mornings like hangovers are to... uh... mornings   Every day it s rise and shine to go get one tasty carne guisada burrito with a little extra egg.  The staff here is super friendly.  Chris at the register greets me with a smile and some chit chat.  The other ladies working the back know me and usually have my order ready before I even pay.  I love this place  the people and the food.  I can t imagine why anyone would go anywhere else for a burrito.  Try it out if you haven t.  But be warned   It s taco crack   One taste and you ll be back again and again and again.  One thing worth mentioning  while high school is in session  watch out for the crowds about mid-morning.  The place packs in what seems like the whole school around 9AM.
Taco Shack,46,I love the food they serve at the other taco shacks but the cashiers here are very rude and slow.  If you don t mind being served by people who look like they want to be there go for it.
Taco Shack,47,Great for to quickly and cheaply quench a taco craving  Great they have vegetarian beans and good salsa    Nice staff  
Taco Shack,48,Amazing crunchy tacos  Fast food done with care and made amazing  They are crunch and greasy. It s a nice treat to have when breaking at work.  I like their salsa too.
Taco Shack,49,Lunch special enchiladas plate was no so great. They threw all the food together on top of each other. Enchiladas were not rolled the way enchiladas are supposed to be. They just threw pieces of meat on top and made it a beef enchiladas plate. Salsa has a sweet taste to it.
Taco Shack,50,I see all the mediocre and I know you re not a true Austinite  because you retards compare it to torchy s  Torchy s is good it s fine it s local  but so is Taco Shack and in all honesty torchy s breakfast tacos are crap compared to the shack. You go to Taco Shack for breakfast tacos. Also  Taco Shack is way more into supporting the local community. So quit your whining transplants or move home.
Taco Shack,51,We use Taco Shack for a monthly staff support breakfast and love it   We give our order to Yoli and she takes care of it.  It s fast  yummy  and the service is great.
Taco Shack,52,Never coming here after 1 visit   Out of chips. Order came out wrong. Told me there was silverware inside. There wasn t. Pointed out my order was wrong. They said they were out of black beans. Didn t put guac on I ordered. Didn t wring up my drink. Sheesh. I can understand a few things wrong. But literally everything   Nope. Not coming back.
Taco Shack,53,My wife and I just waited outside of the Spicewood Springs Taco Shack for about 8 minutes waiting on someone to unlock the doors. We got there at 7 20am and the sign shows they open at 7am  but the doors were locked  we rattled both sets . We waved to a woman inside who appeared to go to the back to tell a manager who took his time coming out. The man was wearing black and just stood there talking to the ladies inside while looking at us. No one ever said anything to us  communicated in any other way or opened the doors. We finally gave up and left. Not only was this location locked up when it was supposed to be open  but they did a great job making it clear they didn t want any business.
Taco Shack,54,They will now put  crispy bacon  on son s breakfast taco  Triumph Caf  is gone  the salsa is fresh  and I can call an order in and drive about half a mile to pick it up.  But they don t have toothpixxxx 
Taco Shack,55,Egg shells in my breakfast tacos on numerous occasions.  I tried to give them a break the first time.  But the second time it was absolutely disgusting how many shells were in there.  I will never go back.  Not worth it.
Taco Shack,56,I showed up at the Taco Shack on Spicewood Springs this past Sunday at 7 10am to find locked doors when their website claims they open at 7am on Sunday s. After standing there and knocking on the door for five minutes  only to be ignored by the staff  someone finally turned around and held up ten fingers. WTF    I went to Tacodeli 
Taco Shack,57,Loved it  Placed a to go order  was ready as soon as I walked in  greeted with a smile   Couldn t beat the service  Even with Torchy s right next door  I d come back again and again just because they provide great food with excellent service   Had the Burnet Road Burrito oh wow   Delicious  
Taco Shack,58,I ordered take-out and they gave me someone else s order  which of course was all boxed up so didn t notice until I got home.  They were not at all crowded  so this was just inexcusable incompetence.  I hope the person who got my order enjoyed it.
Taco Shack,59,Decent enough tacos  should be way cheaper for what you re getting. These tacos aren t elaborate or gourmet and the price should reflect that.
Taco Shack,60,This is the place      I have a heck of an addiction about the breakfast tacos here. Every Friday    Pretty boring taco by some people s desires  but give me that bean  potato  and cheese  a little extra salt and some salsa...YUM    And my kids also share the same addiction. It is our Friday pre-school ritual.   We always call ahead by about 5-10 minutes and they are ready to be paid for and go. The staff gets the job done. No extra frills. Just great tacos  Minimal stool bar seating  several outdoor tables under umbrellas.  Is it Friday yet   
Taco Shack,61,An average taco joint  good for a quick meal. I d probably put it at the same category as Chipotle.  The tacos are Americanized  as opposed to Mexican street taco style  and of good size  so you re getting good value for your money.  Their prices are cheap  a breakfast burrito costs only  6.  We went there for breakfast and I found the options ok  perhaps a little uninspiring.  I suppose I shouldn t expect too much for a fast food type of joint.  Anyways  this is a good option for a quick meal  but probably not more than that.
Taco Shack,62,Most taco places in town are mediocre and get three stars  like this one. There are a handful of fours  and precious few fives. If you re looking for The Best  keep looking. If you need a quick or close breakfast or lunch and happen to be near a Taco Shack  you re in good shape.   I mainly find myself here for breakfast. I was religious about my Saturday morning Taco Shack tacos in college  but that was before the five star haven took over the taco scene in town. I like their potato  egg and cheese  as well as their bacon  egg and cheese. Their almost veggie taco can also really hit the spot. Their crispy ground beef tacos make for a simple but tasty lunch. So while everything I ve had off the menu is fine  it s just nothing special  and their tortillas aren t made fresh  that I can tell  anyway .  I ll admit I m not the biggest fan of their salsa or their hours--closed Sundays--but it does the job most of the time  not that I go there all that often anymore.
Taco Shack,63,Sweet Jesus  what the heck makes this place so good   I m not sure why I have this insane allegiance to Taco Shack.  Maybe it s the name  maybe it s because every time I ve gone  the weather has been awesome and the patio was the perfect place to sit.  Maybe they just have the perfect combination of syrup and carbonated water in their fountain drinks.  Whatever the reason  I m a die hard fan.  The breakfast tacos are primo  but my favorite is the crispy taco plate  the meat is juicy  the lettuce is crispy  and the cheese melds everything together to create the perfect handheld meal.  Let s just suffice it to say that Taco Shack is an Austin institution  and you haven t truly lived unless you ve experienced the Shack Taco.  Plus  the place is called Taco Shack...how awesome is that  
Taco Shack,64,I was headed to a doctor s appointment at ARC Far West when suddenly I realized I was a   early  and b   hungry. What a lovely surprise to find the Taco Shack nestled away on Spicewood.   I got a Shack Pack to share  three potato and egg breakfast tacos and three bacon and egg breakfast tacos. I loved the hot sauce  soft tortillas  and crispy fried potatoes. Eggs good  bacon good  what more do you want    I generally agree with the reviewer who called these tacos  gringo-style  and  safe   but there is no doubt that they are fresh and made to order and pretty dang good.
Taco Shack,65,I LOVE Taco Shack   The Burnet Road Burrito is fantastic   Their house salsa is also really good.  Being able to dine in their nice outdoor seating is very peaceful  even during the summer.
Taco Shack,66,This will be short and sweet since there s not a lot to tell about Taco Shack. Their breakfast tacos rule. I agree that Tacodeli is da bomb  but Taco Shack is located only about 5 minutes from our house.  It definitely gets crowded  especially on Fri and Sat mornings  but the service is always fast  friendly and efficient. The Shack Taco and Burnet Road Burrito are really good  but my favorite is still potato  egg and cheese with some pico de gallo. Their breakfast potatoes are my favorite in anybody s tacos.  Only thing that makes me give 4 instead of 5 stars is that they are closed on Sundays. I know it s their choice and they re being good to their employees   but that doesn t mean I have to like it.  Minus 1 star   Take that   Very minor beef though. I love Taco Shack
Taco Shack,67,I do my best not to get swept up in fads  so I ve tried to be even handed about my morning taco options  given that I work in a taco triangle of sorts. There is Taco Cabana  which will never win any awards  but is easy on the wallet. There is Torchy s  which drips a hipster vibe and overcharges for everything. And then there s Taco Shack  whose history suggests it has a Cheers-esque quality. I ve tried all three many  many times and at the end of the taco  I throw my support behind the Shack.  Some people are a little upset that owners have changed hands and now  no one knows their name -- but me  I m okay with that. I haven t been going long enough  or consistently enough  for people to know my name... and honestly  I prefer food preparers  not  know my name. I only want that sort of relationship with my neighborhood barkeep. I was determined for quite a while to like Torchy s over Taco Shack  because hey  they re cool and everyone raves and my Secret Santa even got me a  10 gift card for there... so of course they re awesome  right   Maybe Torchy s saves all its awesome sauce for their trendy little trailer  because what you get at the Spicewood Springs location is unseasoned eggs  unspicy chiles and chorizo that tastes like overcooked turkey sausage.  But every time I stop at the Shack  service is efficient  the prices are unchanged and I don t experience sticker shock when I order two to go and an orange juice. Their shack taco is consistently filled to the brim with goodies -- potatoes cooked crisply  fluffy eggs  gooey cheese and spicy  but not overly so  chorizo that makes a party in your mouth. On top of that  their salsa is subtly hot and spreads a slow burn over your entire mouth. It s still tingly as I type this. I d rather they have one salsa option and do it dead on than offer a handful of options and all of them are bland and half-assed.   The sole reason I entertained other breakfast tacos as long as I did was because  at the Shack  there s no drive-thru. You must pull up  park  get out  order and wait. And for a person like me who starts the day 15 minutes late  that s an annoyance. But  at best  it s slight. I swallow it whole because I know soon I ll have tastiness in my tummy.  I ll admit up front  however  that I ve never been for lunch or dinner. I feel no need  as I like my tacos the way I like my men - stout  spicy and first thing in the morning.
Taco Shack,68,the Enchilada plate special was great  it comes with 2 Cheese Enchiladas Rice and Beans with a Drink and tortillas all for 6.99 it was great and a great deal. the staff was nice  and the also have coke zero 
Taco Shack,69,This is our go-to breakfast taco joint.  Tacos are always hot and fresh.  Salsa is good  if not anything super special.  When I m really hungry  I get the Burnet Road Burrito  packed with eggs  bacon  cheese and potatoes  loaded up with hot sauce.  DO NOT go to this place for lunch.  I ve been twice and it was horrible.  I tried the fajita chicken tacos and the ground beef tacos.  Both were flavorless.  Stick to breakfast here and you ll be happy.  Go to Taco Deli for lunch.
Taco Shack,70,With all of the choices Austin offers  I d never made it by a Taco Shack location until the other day  and now I know I haven t been missing out on anything. Kinda felt like stepping back in time to my youth  like  back when Taco Bell seemed exotic.  If you like your Tex Mex super-duper old school gringo style  this place might satisfy. For me it held all of the exciting memories of a middle school cafeteria meal. Edible  safe  but oppressive to every grownup sensibility in my goofy head.
Taco Shack,71,I went to Taco Shack for lunch the other day. It was not an experience I would care to repeat.   We ordered two burritos  one carne guisada and the other fajita chicken. At about  5 each they are a good price for lunch. But they were both very disappointing. The meat was dry and flavorless.  The taste of the flour tortillas and shredded iceberg lettuce dominated the burrito  even after I tried adding plenty of  hot  sauce.  Even worse than Chipotle.   Stick to the breakfast tacos.
Taco Shack,72,The hangover healing qualities of a breakfast taco are highly misunderstood and should be explored further.  How can having a couple of breakfast tacos after a night out celebrating a friend s birthday lead to instant recovery   This mystery lies right up there with crop-circles and how did George W. ever get elected  ...but alas  it will likely never be fully solved.  That s ok  as long as Taco Shack keep serving up their  Shack Taco  and their spicy   El Ni o Taco   then I ll keep on having that late night-cap at the bar.     My quick recipe to get you back on your feet starts with their  Shack Taco.    It s a tortilla filled with a heapin  helpin  of chorizo  potatoes  egg  n cheese.  Follow it quickly with one of their  El Ni o Tacos   which is filled with chorizo  beans  egg and jalape os   Wash it down with a cold chocolate milk.  Hangoooover   We don  need no stinkin  hangover 
Taco Shack,73, UPDATED  07 15 2010  They re now open on Sunday due to having some competition in the area.  Overpriced for the quantity and quality  AND NOT OPEN ON SUNDAY MORNING       
Taco Shack,74,I love Taco Shack  they have what I want. A steak  egg  cheese  and salsa with a starbucks Vanilla latte in the morning mmmmm... That and this is one of the few places I ve seen that makes tortas BIG plus. Don t care about anything else but the food   
Taco Shack,75,When you tell someone that one Taco Shack is better than another one  you typically get an eye roll and them thinking you are out of your mind. Prove it you say  Done.  The lady who started the chain was at this location this morning. Maybe she isn t always there but damn those tacos were good. Crispy bacon and eggs a little runny   just the way I like it. I didn t think I really liked Taco Shack but I d say it rivals Taco Deli  which is saying a LOT.   I haven t had their queso yet though  that will be the final test.
Taco Shack,76,Who am I kidding  This place has become a Saturday tradition....  Awesome tacos  awesome patio  never too crowded...  I just wish they were open Sunday
Taco Shack,77,I like the breakfast tacos..but i m Englisgh so my knowledge of tacos is limited.. the tortilla soup is pretty good also... they did get my order wrong however  the guy seemed more interested in my accent.   But enjoyable.
Taco Shack,78,I go for two things  the Burnet Road Burrito and the salsa. My favorite breakfast in Austin. Period.   You take someone from out of town here and the salsa is what they remember. Take 4-6 containers of salsa  add them to the crispy bacon  potatoes  and eggs in the burrito and you ve got a perfect breakfast.   The breakfast tacos themselves are decent  made much better by the afore mentioned salsa  but on their own are nothing special. For anything outside of the confines of the basic breakfast staples  e.g. lunch  fajita tacos  etc  you re best to head else where.
Taco Shack,79,About the most bland crappiest food I ve ever had don t go there unless you like old people. It had no flavor at all.
Taco Shack,80,Breakfast Tacos gone Bad.  Since moving back to Austin a few years back  I noticed Taco Shacks everywhere.  I thought they must be great...I finally tried one and my first thought was WTF.  My second thought was  REALLY WTF     Their tacos are really a 1 2 step above Taco Cabana.  What is all the hoopla about   I work in the area and Triumph cafe is across the street and their breakfast tacos are at least 10x s better...bigger and better.  I hate giving crappy reviews  but really I don t understand.
Taco Shack,81,I will update once I try their lunch.   I stopped by yesterday morning for some tacos on the way to work. Just a quick hop in and hop out. The young lady at the counter seemed nervous but she did really well.  I ended up getting 2 bean and cheese and 2 bacon and egg. They were delicious   The eggs were fluffy and fresh  The beans had a great flavor. I will definitely stop by and get some again.
Taco Shack,82,I ve enjoyed the Taco Shack Burenet Road Burrito for over a decade. To me they are an Austin institution. Always good and consistent. I ve eaten at three different locations. Lamp Light Village and Round Rock. All good and sometimes I just need a burrito 
Taco Shack,83,I actually didn t go here. I had a co worker make a food run literally just like a few minutes ago. He said   I m going to make a food run.  Well I feel like I wasted all  6.47 of my little wallet change for two poorly prepared tacos. The meat was soggy and worst of all SALTY  And I HATE salt. Not only does it burn my lips but too much makes me puke. And one bite into the taco my stomach cringed. And the taco had absolutely no flavor. I could ve done better. Your looking for cheap tacos then your better off at Taco Bell or a taco bus. Seriously  Hate that I wasted my money. I still have my other taco right now. I ll give it to a homeless man. He would appreciate it a lot better than I can right now. I m not saying don t eat here because I haven t tried everything but that taco really discouraged me from trying anything else and I can guaranteed you if I was dining in. I would have definitely gave the tacos back. I d probably have to be drunk to like these tacos.
Taco Shack,84,I was excited when a new taco place moved in within walking biking distance from my house because I love a good breakfast taco after a Saturday morning run.   If you want a cheap  2-ingredient taco for less than two dollars  then this is the place. If you want a migas taco  STANDARD at most taco places  I might add  or request an egg white taco  then prepare for blank looks or  we can t do that.  Seriously. You ve got eggs back there - just crack and separate. How hard can that be   The person who I was prepared to hand over money to because I was patronizing this place said  we can t do that.  Twice.   I also tried to ask one of the umpteen Spanish-speaking workers you can see working in the kitchen if they had a different type of salsa or what were their salsa options   Que   was her response. I tried to remember how to ask  do you have another salsa  in Spanish  but I knew if I asked that  I d just get more of the same. As I sucked it up and walked out with a frown on my face  the only guy speaking English who  can t do that  actually ran up to me by the door to find out what it was I wanted. I thought that proactiveness to avoid losing another customer is the only reason this location is getting more than one star.  UPDATE  I ve accepted the fact that I will most likely only ever order the bacon egg cheese taco. For this  I love them. And they are cheap 
Taco Shack,85,Our office usually gets tacos from Taco Shack on Fridays  I typically get the El Nino or a bean and cheese taco. The El Nino is okay  same with the bean and cheese. These are just typical everyday tacos  nothing really special about them. The location is good but the suite Taco Shack is in is kind of cramped  they do have outdoor seating. There are better tacos out there  this is just a very convenient location for me.
Taco Shack,86,Horrible service  broken a c  bad management  and mediocre tacos. I ll never go here again. There are better places for sure
Taco Shack,87,I love the tagline for The Taco Shack   Home of the Shack Taco.  Really  Ok  so beyond the quirky branding this place really is average. Walking into this location you get a sense that it used to be something else.   The outdoor eating area is great  with a fountain and large umbrellas  a great spot for lunch. Indoor there are three or four swivel stools like an old diner next to a prepping station.  Now  onto the food. I had the cheese enchilada plate  Yoli s Irresistible Enchilada Dinner   which came with rice  refried beans  and two flour tortillas. The enchiladas were made with cheddar  not Velveeta  which is a plus  but they could have used another minute or so in the oven  or under a headlamp . The cheese on the inside wasn t fully melted. By the time I was finished with my lunch the cheese had completely solidified leaving just a mound in my aluminum to-go dish.   The beans were very runny  I prefer mine a bit more sticky. The rice was cooked just right and was decent. The salsa was good  but nothing to write home about. I was pleased that they gave me two small containers of salsa and two more of pico de gallo.   The total was around  7  not out of this world  but not cheap either.
Taco Shack,88,I can now walk here or to Torchy s. I eat a lot more tacos. Taco Shack is pretty basic. The tacos are good  if not quite as exotic as some places. The service is friendly and quick. Good value. If I have a complaint  it s that the tortillas are sometimes not hot off the grill.
Taco Shack,89,I go to this Taco Shack a lot in the morning  because I go to Anderson  right up the road   and it s on my way to school. I always get two sausage and egg tacos  and they re...ok. Sometimes the egg is runny  or there really isn t a good ratio of egg to sausage  I mean  who wants JUST egg and like on small crumble of sausage    and the service is pretty awful in the  morning. I can t even count how many times I ve had to repeat my order  or wait FOREVER. It might just be me  but according to some of these other reviews...it might not be. However  they re pretty cheap  so it evens out.   So  all in all  it s ok. Just ok.
Taco Shack,90,Tacos are good but falls short compared to other similar taco places. Consistently gets orders wrong and employees are not quick to resolve issues.
Taco Shack,91,Taco Shack s breakfast tacos are among the elite in Austin. Theres nothing like a big sexy Bevo Burrito  Their create your own taco s are very good size for the price. I don t know what the hate is about this place.
Taco Shack,92,An oldie but goodie. I haven t been here in 7 years  but it s just as good as when we used to start our week out every Monday morning. A wide variety of unique tacos  the El Ni o is wonderful for those who like beans - but the fajita steak  amp  eggs and the carne asada tacos are a true treat you won t be able to get anywhere else.
Taco Shack,93,An absolute staple for breakfast tacos.  Any time I can make it there makes a good morning. Service is always great. We call in group orders quite often.  During the school year avoid 8 30-ish till about 9am as it s full of high schoolers headed to class and the line can get quite long even with the service as fast as it is.  The owners are local and are great community supporters who provide a lot to local schools as well.
Taco Shack,94,I have been going to Taco Shack for almost 15 years now and will tell you that my last few experiences have been less than satisfactory.  Don t get me wrong  I LOVE the way Taco Shack tastes... My opinion is it is one of the better breakfast tacos in Austin. BUT 4 out of the last 5 times I have gone to this location  I have had EGG SHELLS in my taco. There is not much worse than biting in to a taco and having eggshells crunch in between your teeth. I feel like I have given it numerous tries  but the problem continues to not be fixed. Be wary of your breakfast tacos from this location  because there may be eggshells with your order.
Taco Shack,95,Good God I had the worst food here today.  Have the people that run this place ever had Mexican food  or have they only seen pictures   The Carne Guisada had no flavor and the rice was crunchy. I ve had their breakfast tacos before and their salsa tastes like cocktail sauce. I usually wouldn t take the time to write a review but the people who rave about this place are probably the same ones who keep Poke e Joe s BBQ in business and we must starve them out.
Taco Shack,96,Best breakfast tacos in town  I eat here every morning even though I live across town. Super fast service as well and the salsa is freaking amazing 
Taco Shack,97,I usually get breakfast tacos here because my son loves them. They are OK  no flavor unless you add the salsa. If you are counting carbs  you can get a breakfast bowl  which is basically a taco sans bowl  you re choice of ingredients.
Taco Shack,98,Good old school Tex Mex.  Cheese enchiladas are really good.  Only problems are that the hours it s open should be longer and only breakfast is served on Sunday.  Why not serve everything all day on Sunday 
Taco Shack,99,Best breakfast tacos in Northwest hills.  Staff is really friendly.  if you re a regular you might be greeted by your first name.    I always assumed that all breakfast tacos start with eggs and that you add additional items.  I ve walked away a few times with a potato and sausage taco when my intent was to get egg  potato and sausage.  To avoid that problem I write a list on a piece of paper the ingredients  which always includes eggs  and read it word for word.  The outdoor patio is nice but watch out for the birds.  They also have a 4 stools at a bar inside where you can watch the TV.  Not many people take advantage of that so there is pretty much always a seat.  If you re taking your taco s to go you might want to check your bag to make sure go got what you ordered.  I ve found a mistake  but hey we re all human.  Still a frequent customer.
Taco Shack,100,The breakfast tacos here are amazing. Been coming here for over 10 years  The only downside is the breakfast ends at 1 and the prices have gone up over the years. Other than that  best breakfast tacos in town.
Taco Shack,101,Me   Breakfast Tacos  Her  Sure.  Where  Me   Taco Shack   It s right here on Spicewoooo...oops   We passed it. Her   Hey  what about Torchy s  Me   Let s give it a try.  Taco Shack kinda sucks  anyway.....  Wethinks   If you like your breakfast tacos with blah tortillas  runny eggs and burnt bacon  this is your place.
Taco Shack,102,Mediocre burritos  which is really a travesty because how can you go wrong on burritos  They used really weird  lumpy  squishy blobs of chicken and it was just really gross. I haven t had their breakfast tacos  but hopefully they re better than their burritos. If you re in this area for lunch  China Cafe or Triumph Cafe are better bets.
Taco Shack,103,Summary  needs a  variety pack  for breakfast tacos  options are all Tex  no Mex  price so-so  bacon  amp  egg taco solid quality  potato  amp  egg not  size of tacos fine  tortillas medicore  speed and packaging of bulk order good.  I d intended to pick up breakfast tacos for the office at Molca s Cafe on Mesa. where they are delicious  Mexican  interesting  Nopalitos  amp  egg    and on tortillas made RIGHT THEN  but they weren t answering the phone. What can I say -- it was early  and I d fixed this plan in my head of placing a pickup order to Molca s by phone  since that d worked so beautifully the day before. After they didn t answer  I m not sure why I didn t just go there  as I certainly  just went  to Taco Shack  and Molca s is even on the way. I don t know how the phone call became the crux of the process. You get strange things fixed in your head in the mornings  and somehow the whole plan got tossed.  Anyway  I found myself at Taco Shack nearby. Checking out the menu  the selection was less interesting yet more expensive than Molca s  but I d promised a co-worker tacos. To the cashier I said  the office special   gesturing vaguely and explaining I wanted 16 assorted breakfast tacos -- surely they get this request all the time  Where I expected him to pick right up on my theme  he instead hesitated and demurred  not encouraging me to order 4-of-this  4-of-that  2-of-these  6-of those. I was disappointed to have hit a snag so quickly  but I went with his suggestion of a pedestrian pack of bacon  amp  egg and potato  amp  egg  an order that they are accustomed to  though I d have to accept 18  as the packs came only in sixes. My reasoning in going with it was that if they hesitate to take a longer  varied order  it must be for good reason  they re probably not prepared to handle such orders as quickly or as correctly  or perhaps without much sighing and muttering -- who knows  But I stayed in his comfort zone and accepted his counter-offer of three of their 6-taco packs.   These packs are of their most boring tacos  mind you  egg  amp  potato and egg  amp  bacon. What  no Jimmy Dean  Why not just load one up with mashed potatoes  This is according to my preferences  of course  obviously there s a huge market for absolutely mundane breakfast tacos. I can accept other people liking boring food  and this purchase was for other people  so 18 oatmeal tacos it was.   Taco Shack  please offer larger packs with greater variety. I ve never been to a donut shop where I just can t say  two dozen assorted  and be confident in their judgment and execution. You re in basically the same business. Said donut wranglers ask at most one clarifying question   cake   You ll need a labeling solution beyond a sharpie on the foil to handle this well  print up some stickers. You definitely need something more to serve this  office  customer  because the lady after me said the same thing   tacos for the office  you know   expecting you to catch on and smoothly pack up a variety of tacos  in bulk.   So  onto the tacos themselves. Since I willfully and knowingly ordered something dull  I ll speak only about the quality of the ingredients and their preparation. The strip of bacon in my taco was large  not overcooked  and not too salty. I d be proud to serve that strip of bacon. The scrambled egg was on the soft side  but not runny  also totally acceptable and  like the bacon  quantity was fine. The tortilla was a bland sweatshop tortilla  without character or taste  strictly a vessel. The potato  amp  egg fell short of the bacon  amp  egg  the potatoes were soft and oily. Maybe cooking oil not hot enough  Without salsa  there was little to taste. A co-worker praised the tacos  saying that he  liked a nice mound of egg . Without deprecating his tastes  he was pleased.  Taco Shack  really good salsa can make up for a lot. The red stuff provided was inoffensive  but do you have a verde or habanero option I wasn t told about  maybe  That would have helped a lot  If these options aren t offered  I can t recommend adding them highly enough.  The 18 tacos were assembled within about 5 minutes and neatly piled in an aluminum pan with two containers of salsa  napkins and some spoons. It was a nice  sturdy package  and helped keep them warm.   I m rating Taco Shack A-Ok  because it s not to my tastes or cheap enough to make up for that  but I m the one that ordered it  someone else liked it fine  and they did some significant things right.
Taco Shack,104,I am going to give up on hoping that Taco Shack can fulfill my breakfast taco cravings.   I have tried a few times and each time I am left disappointed.   The lack of flavor and seasoning in both the taco and salsa is a reoccurring theme when I order my trusty egg and potato breakfast tacos.  Sure  there are plenty of eggs  which were watery  and potato s in the flour tortilla  but that doesn t cut it.   The salsa tastes like tomato sauce with a little bit of kick.   Even after adding salt pepper and the entire container of salsa  I was still unable to enjoy my breakfast taco.
Taco Shack,105,Is it just me  or are their tacos soggy and bland   There are definitely better options  especially for breakfast tacos.
Taco Shack,106,My sunday doesn t start until I ve had my  Burnet Road  breakfast taco from Taco Shack. They are so quick and their tacos are awesome 
Taco Shack,107,Can t tell you anything about their lunch offerings  but their breakfast tacos are hands down my  and my family s  favorites in Austin.  The eggs are never too dry or runny  the bacon is thick and crispy but not burnt  and the potatoes are just right.  Then there is the salsa  mmmmmmm.  I envy their salsa skills.  I normally will use a green salsa on eggs  but their red is the perfect complement to my bacon  egg  and cheese taco.
Taco Shack,108,I stop at this Taco Shack occasionally in the morning on my way to work. I get a bacon and egg taco and an OJ pretty much every time. I like the bacon  when it isn t overcooked and too crispy  and the eggs are usually fluffy and tasty. But the real reason I choose Taco Shack over Torchy s  which is also right on my way to work  is because they have bottled OJ that is easy to take to-go.  Taco Shack isn t anything special  but it is convenient  the salsa is great  and the prices are dirt cheap  a taco and OJ for less than 4 bucks . The biggest problem is that the Shack is inconsistent in all aspects. The service is sometimes fast and friendly  and  sometimes it is slow and cold-shouldered. The food also has some consistency issues. Sometimes my taco is filled to the brim with Bacon and Egg  other times I have a smattering of eggs and a burnt piece of bacon.  They hit more than they miss  but the misses stand out because when they miss  they miss by a mile. If the food and service were more consistent  I would easily give the Shack 4 stars  but the tacos just aren t as good as some others I have had. They are MILES and MILES better than Rudy s b-fast tacos though so that s a plus. I feel like I am rambling a bit  so I will wrap this up.   Pros  Location is super convenient  Two-Ingredient tacos are real cheap  Salsa is really good   Bottled OJ is easy to take to-go  Cons  It s usually packed to the brim with high school students in the AM  Service can be iffy at times  Can be inconsistent with food
Taco Shack,109,I only go here for breakfast tacos or breakfast burritos. I think they re pretty tasty. I get the burnet road burrito with beans in it and its very good. It could use a little bit more cheese in it  but overall everything is tasty.  Their eggs aren t ever runny. The bacon is cooked their so its thick and crispy   I hate places that give me pre-cooked bacon . The potatoes are nice  crunchy and slightly  seasoned. The salsa has just the right kick to it it makes the tacos burrito better.  The only other of their locations I ve been to is the one right by Burnet and Medical Parkway  and I think both are really well run and produce some pretty tasty food.
Taco Shack,110,VERY LONG LINE for the drive-thru that took four score and seven years for a blasted taco.
Taco Shack,111,Here s how I like my tacos  corn tortilla  a lighter  well-spiced combination of ingredients  maybe some chicken with peppers and onions  pork and pineapple  or eggs and avocado...   topped off with some perky  not too spicy  mind you  salsa. If you disagree with my taste  that s cool. But if you like your tacos like I like my tacos  be forewarned  this is not the place for you. I tried to order their nice-looking lunch plate on a weekend and was informed that they don t do lunch tacos on weekends  only breakfast tacos  ...really  why  seriously   so I had to make a stressful snap decision between several flour tortillas filled with some variation of beef and potatoes. I ended up with two heavy  greasy tacos  with salsa that I thought was ketchup at first  not the best start to my Saturday. Think I ll head over to Torchy s for some REAL breakfast tacos.
Taco Shack,112,The place for breakfast tacos if you re on the way to work. Not as good as Taco Xpress but much more convenient on the north side of Austin. Great breakfast fillings in an adequate flour tortilla - if they made the tortillas fresh on site like Taco Cabana they d be darn near perfect. Their non-breakfast offerings are just so-so.
Taco Shack,113,Taco Shack may be my favorite breakfast taco in Austin. Good potatoes  great hot sauce.  This location  however  is wildly inconsistent. 8 times out of 10 it s great. Those other times ... watch out  Taco sizes vary widely. Sometimes the tacos are well made  sometimes thrown together  I get grumpy about tacos which are all a lump of ingredients at one side.  Sometimes the bacon is crisped up nicely  other times its a slab of disgusting fat.  Their coffee is much better than you expect. They must be using a pretty good bean.  The crispy taco plate for lunch is one of my guilty pleasures.
Taco Shack,114,First time at the Shack  not particularly impressed. Got a chicken burrito. It was ok. Not bad  not great  not even sure I d call it  good . it was just kinda there. Nothing to distinguish it.  Heard the service here was friendly  but did not find that to be the case. The place was empty  I walk in and mention it s my first time there. The woman at the counter just stares at me. Says nothing. Oooooookay  I guess I ll try to figure out what s good. I look at the menu  figure I ll play it safe and get a burrito. She takes my order  gives me my change  never smiles once  never thanks me for the order. A few minutes later a guy hands me my food  no smile  no thanks  nothing.  Only reason I went here is they re walking distance from my office. Wish I d just gotten in the car and went to Torchy s. Doubt I ll be back.
Taco Shack,115,My wife and I stopped by for a quick and tasty lunch. She had tacos and I had cheese enchiladas. Although you dine outside  the patio had the appearance of being clean and attended with fresh flowers and big umbrellas to fend off the Texas sun.
Taco Shack,116,I went here once and thought that someone took a dump in a tortilla and wrapped it in tin foil.  Not very appetizing  especially when considering Torchy s is down the street.
Taco Shack,117,I always stop here on my way to work. I can get in and out of there in like 6 minutes  It s awesome  Bacon is always nice and crispy  but sometimes the eggs can be kind of runny  not every time  but sometimes  I see them peeling their own potatoes when I go in sometimes  I like to see that kind of stuff 
Taco Shack,118,Good place to get a breakfast taco.  Nothing fancy just good.
Taco Shack,119,I tried them for the 3rd time today  close to my job .  Not impressed.  It gets worse every time I go in.  The salsa tastes like Pace too.
Taco Shack,120,Oh Taco Shack you capricious mistress. Taco Shack is good for two basic  things  good breafast tacos  and ok lunch foods. I never knew why most of the locations close after lunch and do not reopen till next morning. Why is that  Because they know they d dip into the red ink if they tried to compete with other restaurants for dinner. Put simply  Taco Shack  which I wholly admire for it s homegrown roots and undying support of local Austin schools and businesses  is all about emphemera and speed. Is there anything wrong about such humble practicality  No -- unless you re a snob. It s all about showing up hungover on a Tuesday for a Shack Taco taco  downing it and a medium dr. Pepper  and getting out of there. It s about having 25 minutes for a bullshit lunch  swooping in  gulping down a plate of enchiladas  and peacing out. To get specific  aside from the two dishes I mentioned and the Bevo Breakfast Burrito everything else is pretty generic  but not all bad  today the shell of my taco salad was good...that s something  the guac  Not so much . But that s the whole point -- it s about quick eats. Not gourment dishes. You win some you lose some  accepted casualties here and there. If the food was totally fantastic people would feel guilty swooping in and not taking ample amounts of time to enjoy it.  Despite all this  this Taco Shack today played a lot of The Cars. And Devo. They love 80s New Wave. That s a plus in my book.
Taco Shack,121,went there for the first time this morning  and had the breakfast orlando plate  which was a large amount of juicy scrambled eggs  covered in cheese and all sorts of other things of some description  with sides of fresh avocado  refried beans and a couple of tortillas.  it wasn t beautiful. but it was tasty.   the eggs were soft and juicy and the avocado was really delicious. the tortillas were soft and steamy. the refried beans were completely smooth  and not that great  but i m not much in a bean mood in the morning anyway.  the coffee was good  actually. was quite surprised about that.  overall  tasty  squidgy  cheesy eggs  a guilty pleasure.   - 
Taco Shack,122,It was ok. I probably won t go back. food was ok nothing great.
Taco Shack,123,Went in this morning because I am getting tired of waiting 35 minutes in Torchy s death-defying drive-thru.  What an absolute disappointment.    The dummy working the counter rang up two tacos after I had ordered three.  He then failed to give me a cup for my iced tea.  Finally he gave me  4 change instead of the  14 I was owed.  Tortillas are not made fresh  all other taco items are held in a steam table within plain sight of the customers.  No attempt made to hide the dismal  pre-prepared fixin s.  Boo 
Taco Shack,124,Terrible. Poor quality. Nothing tastes fresh. Migas plate was extremely underwhelming and very over priced. Oh and there was grease in the bottom  How does that even happen..gross. Never  ever again.
Taco Shack,125,I ve been twice to this location and each time has been a total disappointment.  The food is borderline inedible.  I tried the fajita beef and fajita chicken.  This must be the lowest grade of meat possible.
Taco Shack,126,Love this place.. It s hard to find a place that has Barbacoa Tacos    The potato and egg tacos are awesome   I try to go when I get a chance.
Taco Shack,127,I east here at least once a week for breakfast tacos.  The tacos are custom made while you wait  so they are hot an fresh.  The SHACK TACO is the best and hits the spot everytime.  My son likes the bacon egg potato or the steak and egg.  I ve also had the taco lunch special a few times  the crispy tacos are very good.
Taco Shack,128,Torchy s Tacos on Spicewood Springs has a great location.  Parking is severely limited--we had to park across the  street and had no pedestrian walkway on a very busy street.  The food we ordered came out cold  and the portions were very small  hungry folks should order extra food.  It s a small place with limited seating.  The outside covered pation had comfortable seating in good weather. We will never return because so many better Mexican restaurants are in the area.
Taco Shack,129,I always have great service and awesome food when I go here. The employees are usually very nice and engaging and they make some darn good tacos. I d definitely recommend them.
Taco Shack,130,I get the potato  egg  and cheese taco with either a coffee  which is decent  or a chocolate milk  which is unfortunately not organic and is filled with hydrogenated corn syrup .  The tacos are greasy and taste great.
Taco Shack,131,Perhaps if Austin didn t have such great taco places this would have gotten a better score. There s nothing really wrong with the tacos but they re more Taco Bell style than across the border or something fun and funky. With a Torchy s a mere two blocks away I just wouldn t bother with Taco Shack.
Taco Shack,132,It s not Taco Shack in general that s the problem  the one on 620 is amazing. But THIS one...they DON T SERVE LUNCH ON WEEKENDS. Think about it. You re starving for a burrito or some nachos and it s past noon--shouldn t be too hard  right  Nope  this place will only give you breakfast stuff. All weekend. Most Taco Shacks serve the full menu all the time but for some reason this one can t be bothered--and EVERY SINGLE TIME I have gone in there asking for nachos  my favorite food  they have very rudely told me that they aren t serving lunch yet or at all that day. And somebody else gets my business  every time. I d recommend going to literally any other place.
Taco Shack,133,Good tacos and friendly staff. They make your tacos fresh to order and the hot sauce is yummy. All locations are consistent too.
Taco Shack,134,This Taco Shack used to be better  but  when they switched management a few years back  they lost a degree of personality. They used to call everyone by name  now it s just numbers. The cheese they use tastes a bit strange  and it s not as melted as I would like it. It seems as though they are going for speed rather than ensuring that all tacos are well prepared. The bacon was also fairly uncooked  and I had to remove most of it from my taco..what a waste of money. If you re looking for a good Taco Shack  head on over to Medical Parkway because this one doesn t make the cut.
Taco Shack,135,So  truckin  on Spicewood Springs to work this morning and decided to stop and  re-visit  this particular Taco Shack.  Again  super disappointed  My order   potato  beans and cheese  and  beans and bacon tacos.... the coffee was really good.  The beans were runny  tasteless and a  schmear  on my tortilla.  Potatoes were white  greasy and underdone. Bacon was tasty..... I was a Taco Shack customer when they first opened on the little triangle at Burnet and Medical Parkway.......great tacos.  I eventually went away as a customer when they were not as consistent with the quality and the ingredients in the tortillas were very scarce. I thought I recognized the owner at the register  although he was not very friendly.  When I looked at my receipt I see that I was waited on by   Server  1   so who knows.   I work by Taco Shack  live in East Austin by Porfirios on Holly Street  so I guess if I want morning tacos Porfirios is my best bet.  They serve a taco that is consistenly tasty  full of ingredients and friendly service.
Taco Shack,136,i love their potatoe egg  and cheese tacos. i LOOOOOOOOOVEEEEEEE THIER SALSA                                              
El Pollo Regio,1,Oh  Pollo Regio  where do I start   I tend not to order steaks at restaurants. The reason is simple  anyone can make steak taste good. Taking expensive  high quality ingredients and making them taste good isn t that impressive. I ve always had much more respect for the humble street food. The windows and carts that take the more humble cuts and put in the work to make them taste like fine cuisine. It s curious to me that I have to pay  50 to have someone cook a steak that tastes exactly like what I can make at home and yet for  9 I can get a pound of carne asada that s likely tastier than anything I ve ever cooked.  Pollo Regio is a humble place. There is no dining room  just a window with a line of hungry people outside of it. Behind that window  there is magic. They take glamorous meats and turn them into something incredible.  I know that there are many people in this world who love chicken and hate red meat but I m still convinced they re lying to themselves. 90  of the chicken in this world is dry and bland and bordering on inedible. Sure  chicken is great breaded and fried or covered in sweet sauces  or both   but chicken on it s own  Usually it s a chore to eat. Something you convince yourself that you like because you know beef is going to give you cancer or impotence or hernias or whatever the study-of-the-day was on the morning news today. I think a lot of chicken ends up on salad to remind you that things could be worse  your chicken could instead be lettuce.  And yet  the chicken at Pollo Regio is none of those things. It is delicious  well-seasoned  and every bite is a treat. Usually  through some kind of magic  they manage to keep even the breast moist. A miracle   9 gets you a half chicken and  13 gets you a whole. Both come with rice and beans but we usually skip those and opt for extra green sauce and an extra onion because we  try to  do the low carb thing. The beans are great  however. Even if you re all about the carbs  I STRONGLY suggest that you skip a tortilla at least once and instead build yourself a taco using as onion layer as your  tortilla . It s life-changing..  What of the 2nd item on Pollo Regio s 2-item menu  The Carne Asada is a feat of culinary science. We ve weighed it before and you re generally getting nearly a pound of cooked beef for  9  plus the sides. The beef is certainly not ribeye but the beauty is that they take low-end beef cuts and turn them into a dish that is a perfect mix of crispy  tender  and delicious.  Regio technically has about a dozen things on the menu but they re all just reconfigurations of these 2 core proteins. I go with my girlfriend and we get a half chicken and a carne asada plate and we always have enough leftovers for at least 1 of us to get an extra meal. 3 meals for  18 is an amazing price to pay for food this delicious.
El Pollo Regio,2,I love this place. Been coming here for years getting the whole chicken  making tacos with the super soft corn tortilla s and drowning them in green sauce. Mmmm. My husband got the carne asada taco tonight for the first time and those are definitely added into the rotation.
El Pollo Regio,3,This is our our go-to easy  cheap  fast dinner option. Having unexpected company  Just go grab a chicken and all the fixins for legit  delicious tacos that are as cheap as they are tasty. The chicken is an A  but the beans are an A  . Maybe the best pinto beans in Austin  For best results  get extra beans. Otherwise you ll just be fighting over them and life s too short for that. Highly recommend 
El Pollo Regio,4,My husband and I have a special nod while driving through Austin. No words needed. We stop off a Pollo Regio and always get 2 Taco Carne Asada Tacos with extra corn tortilla and extra green stuff. My husband speaks spanish--so he orders  and I go next door to grab us 2 forty s of cerveza.  WE go under the penny backer bridge and enjoy a romantic  orgasmic meal in our car.  The corn tortillas. A must. The green sauce. oh my god. The beef. I just lust over it. My mouth quivers upon seeing it. The pico. I love it. The grilled jalepeno. PUT IT IN MY FACE.  We don t talk throughout our meal and immediately make out afterwards.  I love you PR 
El Pollo Regio,5,LOVE IT   Cannot rave enough about it. Been here countless times. I do warn that the English is limited but the food is soooo good. And it looks like they are expanding. Green sauce is awesome. We usually get a while chicken. And I LOVE THE BEANS 
El Pollo Regio,6,Mmm riquisimo the creamy green salsa it s really good  i ate pollo regio como dos veces por semana  but cada vez it s more expensive  so now como una sola vez.
El Pollo Regio,7,Holy Yard Bird BATMAN   This was beyond delicious it was darn tootin  SPANKY    There are in no way enough fabulous adjectives to describe it     The building and area a bit scary. The English spoken at the window is limited. The food however is NOT. The food is astronomical and gastronomically delicious   Only suggestion is more beans and less juice. Rice great    Green sauce delicious.  Limes and onions yummy dummy DOOOO toooo   LOVE IT AND WILL BE BACK      See you soon   
El Pollo Regio,8,So good  A couple of friends showed me this place  oh my gosh  the chicken is amazing and the stuffed potatos will leave you with a potato baby in your stomach. Painful but worth every bite 
El Pollo Regio,9,i highly recommend pollo regio - both the chicken and the carne asada. if you ve been here and love the chicken  try the carne asada  it s like delicious meat popcorn. the rice and beans are good  too   so glad to have found this place  thank you yelp.
El Pollo Regio,10,Chicken was good. Only problem was I paid and ordered a full chicken. But  I only had one half of the bird. Is this is a new trend  The place was dirty and the employees ignore you being there at the window. Joking and cavorting among themselves while the customers awaiting at window. I am sure their social needs are more important than their job tasks. I paid  15.90. Did l paid enough for a full bird  Or am I supposed to go back an other day to pick up the rest of my order 
El Pollo Regio,11,Their chicken has literally fucked my world up it s so good  one of the consistently best things i have eaten after 24 years of eating in Austin. Get the whole chicken  extra rice and beans and green sauce.
El Pollo Regio,12,This place totally escaped my radar for a long time  I refer to this place as the  the whole in the wall chicken joint  if memory serves me correctly you order through a small window in the side of a kind of shady shopping center. Its all cash but the chicken is amazing  Super succulent and juicy  Right amount of spices. They give you a heaping of tortillas and grilled onions. Load up on the green sauce  the  agua-mole  its fantastic  I need to get back here and devour some bird.
El Pollo Regio,13,This chicken is so good  I have heard my co-worker talk about it before and she brought me some today and MAN it was so good  I will certainly get more of this and it is really affordable  you get alot of food 
El Pollo Regio,14,Best Dam whole chicken you cam find  Be sure to bite into the onion that comes with it     You won t be living if you don t.....
El Pollo Regio,15,larry david would have no scruples choosing this chicken over the palestinian chicken. reminds me of tandori chicken in a way...but spicier and smokier. drool
Lolita La Tampiquea,1,This is the best taco food truck I have had in a while. The owner is real nice  food tastes natural  and the hot sauce is delicious. I highly recommend this place.
Lolita La Tampiquea,2,It s now called Capitol Taco  but very good  Same location. Gtrat fried avocado tacos  Also vegie burgers as well. Drinks next door from convenience store. Tables available.
Lolita La Tampiquea,3,Hidden gem  Quick  tasty  and reasonably priced. Some of the tacos can come out a little dry  but the flavor is unmatched  particularly when paired with the spicier salsa offering. When I went it was an orange colored salsa and absolutely delicious. Will definitely be back  Of the tacos I had I recommend the migas and carnitas the most.
Lolita La Tampiquea,4,Pretty good food. Portions were large. Definitely can share or save for later. Salsa was great as well they use some chipotle which I ve never had and not a fan of but was pretty good.
Lolita La Tampiquea,5,This is my go to for quick Mexican food. The ladies that run this taco truck are lovely. I ve just tried the tacos and they are good. Also you can call ahead and then pick up so you don t have to sit it your car.
Lolita La Tampiquea,6,Yumm these were so good  I had the potato egg and cheese and it was so good  The red salsa is my favorite 
Lolita La Tampiquea,7,We LOVE Lolita s  The baby and I hit the taco truck multiple times a week after dropping off the big kids at school. The eggs are seasoned well and not runny. The green sauce is sooo spicy good  My husband likes the steak and cilantro tacos. And the big kids really like the bacon  cheese  amp  bean  refried black beans with plenty of flavor without being spicy . Not expensive  always friendly and ALWAYS yummy  And right down the street 
Lolita La Tampiquea,8,The food truck with hand sanitizer is behind the Exxon on the corner   you have to walk a little uphill that has a beautiful  shady oak tree and two sturdy picnic tables and singing birds.  The workers speak very good English and explain the dishes happily.  I ordered the pambazos  and for the first time.  It s like an enchilada  but the dough is different -- more like a toasted hoagie bread.  They had special meat today and I chose the chunky and moist chicken fajita.  The mild sauce is very flavorful.  The wait is a little longer  because they cook fresh.  It is somewhat large and presented beautifully in a clam.  For  8 I wouldn t rush back for a sandwich  however it would be a wonderful treat.  Enjoy  
Lolita La Tampiquea,9,Don t ever eat here the food is terrible They don t have beef fajitas and the kind of meat they have is steak and it s real tough.
Lolita La Tampiquea,10,I m not normally in this area  but the one day I was I needed gas and pulled into this Exxon station. As soon as I got out of my car I could smell some amazing food. I immediately knew I was going to get tacos from Lolita s. I went with the tacos al pastor and the cashier recommended I try the homemade corn tortillas and I m so glad she did  I ll definitely be stopping by this truck anytime I m even close to the Cuernavaca area of Westlake Hills.
Lolita La Tampiquea,11,Yum yum - always worth driving down Cuernavaca. The ladies in the food trailer are super nice. Order via phone amd you ll get the good stuff even faster. One of the best breakfast tacos in the West.
Lolita La Tampiquea,12,Not to disrespect anyone who has tried having food service on Cuernevavca  but thank God we finally have a taco stand. I stopped to see what was happening and had the al pastor burrito for  6. Without having seen the  3 tacos  I can t imagine they would have this much meat in them as well as a generous portion of beans and rice. The al pastor was on point. She uses black beans and the rice in it was good too. Green sauce was a little hot  but for once a red sauce outshines the green.  It s rich and thick. Reminds me of Torchy s sauce  although way better. The guy in front of me bought a torta. It looked huge. I may have to try that next time. She said she has tamales on Saturdays.  1 for your typical corn husk masa style and occasionally she ll have a more Central American plantain tamale for  3. I didn t post a picture of the breakfast taco menu  but they do that too. Curious if she ll have migas sometimes.  Very much worth the stop.
Lolita La Tampiquea,13,Excellent tacos. They make their salsa fresh and it is AMAZING  Everything I ve had here is delicious.
Lolita La Tampiquea,14,Great breakfast tacos and enchiladas   Friendly family run place. It s all homemade in house. The sauces are also made there    Everything is made to order.... So portion and salt level and heat level can vary. But if you just ask for how you want it  they will gladly make it just like you like    I haven t ventured far from my regular food  but I m excited to try the Tortas. They look so good.  They are fast and put love into the food   I never wait more than a few minutes. You can call in orders. Although I never see people wait more than about 5 minutes  even for bigger orders.  These ladies are amazing I m so glad this place is close to me
Lolita La Tampiquea,15,These guys are the best  It took me a year of living in the neighbourhood to try it  definitely guilty of judging the book by its cover  but I m glad that I now know how flipping delicious these cuernevaca truck stand tacos are  - family run  super friendly  pretty cheap. . Things are made to order so much they can tweak the spice levels to get them perfect for you. They make the salsa here too. They always have two kinds - a mild and a spicy - And it s always worth getting both    Mostly open week day lunchtimes - I ve not seen any activity in the evenings  definitely worth sampling if you need lunch in Lake Hills - it s in a bit of a weird spot behind the Exxon gas station - but they have shady picnic tables to eat at  and the gas station next door to grab cold drinks from.   I love a good food truck almost as much as I love good Mexican food. Win Win 
Lolita La Tampiquea,16,I hits this food truck every week cuz it s on my pool route... They have some great tacos and their hot sauce is just right 
Lolita La Tampiquea,17,No idea where these couple of low reviews are coming from... I ve had tacos all over Texas and these are some of the best. Super nice family  too.
Lolita La Tampiquea,18,So far I haven t been disappointed regarding the food. The have great service and are easy going when treating the costumer. Best food truck around here.
Lolita La Tampiquea,19,Not really exceptional as other reviews would have you believe. I tried the enchiladas and could have done better elsewhere. Making an out of the way trip is not worth the effort in my opinion. Maybe if the location was convenient  I d try something else.
Lolita La Tampiquea,20,The food is great and the service is good too. I love the sopes. They re huge  The carnitas taco are even better  They have shady picnic tables to eat at. They arent open for dinner so that s bummer but they re open for lunch. They are usually closed by 2pm.
Lolita La Tampiquea,21,Probably my favorite taco place. Meat is flavorful and the hot sauces add just the right amount of kick.
Lolita La Tampiquea,22,No to tasty  really heavy on the food grease. Also Instead of something that should of took 10 min took over 35 min  just a really bad first impression.
Lolita La Tampiquea,23,Terrific neighborhood taqueria with killer tacos  of course   tortas  enchiladas  house made salsas. Affordable and authentic. Breakfast tacos all day 
Salsa Limn,1,Had a really great time. A group of my 8 friends sat comfortably outside on their patio. Their el captain tacos were amazing and their drinks too. The manager checked on us and was super nice. I ordered a drink that was no longer available and he checked with me and made me an awesome drink. We all really enjoyed this restaurant. Definitely coming back.
Salsa Limn,2,They re alright.   A bit pricey   6 for a vegan taco  and they add cabbage and onions every time without asking.   Good atmosphere  plants  music.
Salsa Limn,3,Wow. If you like  Mexican  food completely DEVOID of flavor  then Salsa Limon is the place for you.  We haven t been going out a lot other than our local downtown spots since it s been nice to be cooking back at home after being gone for so long  but came here on Friday night. HUGE MISTAKE. The food is terrible  and this new restaurant will go the way of the doomed popsicle place before it and be closed soon enough.  Their preferred ingredient here is AGUA. The queso and salsa were watery and bland and the  margaritas  tasted like someone squirted some lime in some water and splashed tequila on top  the  frozen  one was like a slushy that had been sitting out all day  also  both drinks were served AFTER the food arrived . The guac was nothin  but mashed avocado and the  salsita salad   which is advertised as having  mixed greens  arrived with only iceberg and--you guessed it--the most watery and flavorless dressing imaginable. We got it with barbacoa  and this places manages the miraculous feat of of making something as special as barbacoa taste boring and lifeless. The El Capitan taco was the only thing that showed signs of life and seemed to have seasoning on it. Our daughter s quesadilla was standard and her beans tasted like they came straight out of a can.   The benches are significantly lower than the height of the table  so eating is awkward. Service is friendly-ish at the register  but stops at that. Honestly  we cannot even believe that this place has lasted this long. Are they just hoping for the El Patio patrons unwilling to wait to meander over  We d highly recommend just going up the block to Torchy s instead.
Salsa Limn,4,I didn t realize there s a new taco place near the campus. It s basically a taco place with bar  very modern interior and plenty of space  But their taco is really really tasty  I especially like the tortilla a bit toasted with a bit crispy texture  The cheese was so so satisfying  And please don t forget about their sauce  it s really spicy but I m the boss with the sauce 
Salsa Limn,5,New to Austin  coming from Fort Worth. Great spot on North Campus for quick tacos  great margaritas  plus a covered patio   tacos. brunch. palomas. margaritas. breakfast all day.    chips  amp  dips trio  11     breakfast taco w chorizo  4     chilaquiles  9     taco  4.25     el capitan taco  4.75     agua de rancho  7     frozen margarita  8     agua fresca  41 - horchata    austin exclusives    lupita  vegan   4     paloma fizz  9    Overall  I would come back. Everyone was very nice  the food was decent but wasn t blown away by the carne asada I got in a couple of tacos. Chilaquiles was incredible  get the chicken with it 
Salsa Limn,6,Super delicious  Wanted a breakfast taco at noon and boy was it amazing. Would definitely come back 
Salsa Limn,7,Only went in for a margarita and service and both were terrible. Ordering is confusing and you get treated poorly when you finally figure it out and the kiosks don t work. There s a sign that says  smile you re on camera  but the employees need a sign that says  smile you re in customer service .  Won t come back to try the food and do not recommend.
Salsa Limn,8,This spot just recently opened up on West Campus and I personally think it has a lot of potential. I would recommend skipping the tacos and get the Campe n Burrito instead. It was a hefty portion  but super flavorful and I didn t think I was going to enjoy it as much as a did  But if you do get a taco  get the El Capitan and order it with your choice of meat. They also have margaritas by the PITCHER  which they make a little on the strong side  so drink with caution.   Oh as a plus  they also have a parking lot  Which is rare for traveling anywhere near West Campus.
Salsa Limn,9,the granjero tacos were amazing   Fresh goodness spilling out if homemade corn tortillas. Frozen mango margarita was delightful.  Wonderful neighborhood taco joint 
Salsa Limn,10,Decided to try something new on ubereats and this place was very disappointing.  I even added extra Asada to my burrito and there was still barely any asada in the burrito.  The same with the asada quesadilla.  The quality of meat was definitely not good.  Chipotle s way better.  Highly do not recommend.
Salsa Limn,11,Came here opening day and my experience was flawless. I got the burrito with carne asada. The tortilla was toasted which gave it a nice texture. The meat was perfectly seasoned and not too oily at all. The rice was just right. I paired it with a variety of salsas. The habanero has a kick  and couldn t stop putting it on the burrito. I washed it all down with a frozen marg with a grand marnier floater. These frozen margs will be perfect for the summer as they have the consistency of a slushy or icee. Can t be wait to try the other options on the menu.
Salsa Limn,12,The atmosphere is super nice with an eclectic modern vibe.   I got the Barbados which was super tasty and a good amount of complexity in the flavor profile.   The chicken in the chicken taco was seasoned well but the taco as a whole was underwhelming. It might have tasted better with more add ons but that would ve been  6 for a small taco.   Overall I was unimpressed with how small the tacos were for the price and how the flavor profiles weren t astounding or complex
Salsa Limn,13,I really liked Salsa Limon. The space is well designed  the tacos are excellent  with a lot of vegan and vegetarian options  the staff are friendly  and the prices are good. Their happy hour is EXCELLENT - Monday-Friday  4-6pm  no weird hours    5 rocks margaritas which are house-made  and super cheap beers  I think like  4    . Honestly  no notes. I got the mushroom taco and the carnitas taco and that was more than enough for dinner. The salsas are hot and made fresh. I don t know if this location is just cursed because I also liked the popsicle shop that was here before and nobody went there  but Salsa Limon is worth checking out 
Salsa Limn,14,Came in looking for good chilaquiles near campus. Ordered horchata  chilaquiles with mushroom filling  and the barbacoa and chicken tacos. Horchata is good but has a tiny bit of cinnamon sediment  but it adds to the flavor. Chilaquiles are absolutely delicious  especially with a bit of red salsa added on top. My partner had the barbacoa and chicken tacos  which he liked quite a bit  They had 4 types of salsa  all solid and the spicy ones definitely packed a punch. They did forget the egg on my chilaquiles at first so they gave us free guac and chips  Horchata also had free refills  Their happy hour special looks great as well. My only  slight  complaint is the price  but the quality of ingredients justifies it for me. Will be recommending Salsa Limon to my friends 
Salsa Limn,15,This little place was a pleasant surprise  Drinks were pretty good  tacos were yummy and the overall vibe was pleasant  My only tiny gripe was portion size but that s a personal preference  I enjoyed my sangria and left in a good mood. I would recommend this place if you re on Guadalupe looking for good Mexican food 
Salsa Limn,16,My family gave this place a chance. The menu was definitely hit or miss. The barbacoa quesadilla was a HIT  It seemed a bit pricey at  10.50  but the portion size  including side of rice and refried beans  is enough for two people to share. Skip the carne asada tacos that were  5 each. Queso was unremarkable...tasted like melted Velveeta  and could have used a bigger portion of chips . If you re looking for value  skip this place.
Salsa Limn,17,I paid  12 for a bean burrito. Told the cashier I had never been there before and she recommended a couple of things  including the El Campeon burrito. I m a huge barbacoa and burritos so I was excited to hear that option. I kid you not  had two bites of meat inside of it. It was 70  bean  15  rice  10  creama  3  avocado  2  meat. Tortilla was fresh and flavors were decent but aside from that I am very disappointed. Maybe their tacos are what s keeping them in business but wouldn t gamble coming back to this place.
Salsa Limn,18,I ve been to Salsa Limon twice now  and I have I to say it s my new favorite taco joint in Austin  Their chicken tacos are DELICIOUS  So tender and juicy. Their tortillas are fresh and fantastic. I would also highly recommend the Paloma fizz  and the Jamaica agua Fresca- so refreshing and not overly sweet. Overall you can tell a lot of thought went into the menu  and decor of the place. I will be spending a lot of time and    at this place 
Salsa Limn,19,Came here for breakfast to see if we could salvage a terrible breakfast at 24 7 diner. It turned out to be a  best of the worst contest.  We ordered the chilaquiles and migas. Get this  they get tortilla chips and ladle sauce over the top  sprinkle their toppings and call them  chilaquiles  Fail. The migas are an embarrassment. They should just call them  tortilla strips with scrambled eggs. Over cooked eggs  that is. I was excited to visit this place after reading about them online. The sign up front says  Help wanted  it needs to read  Help Needed  Also  someone in the kitchen wearing airpods  just like the last place we visited. It s a gross look.
Salsa Limn,20,legit. They have chile piquin salsa   Very few places in Austin can say they have this on their tacos. Fresh tortillas too 
Salsa Limn,21,Just like the one in Dallas  this place was amazing and lived up to the hype  We enjoyed our tacos and I think I had the best chicken quesadilla I ve ever had in my life. The margaritas were solid  not my favorite in town  but pretty good . The staff and ordering process was a bit unorganized but may just be new growing pains. The patio is super cute and shaded. We ll be back to satisfy our taco craving 
Salsa Limn,22,This place is mediocre at best  The drinks were subpar and the food was wayyyyyy tooo cheesy  overpriced for what your getting  Totally disappointing  The seating was very small  tables were small and the whole ambience was totally juvenile 
Salsa Limn,23,Umm WOW  My boyfriend and I went to this place twice over the weekend after trying it for the first time because it was so delicious. I got the chicken tacos and he got the El Capitan tacos with chicken. The crispy cheese on the el capitan was insane  I tried a bite  and the chicken was marinated to perfection and not chewy at all  my biggest fear is chewy chicken...bleh  . Okay and the refried beans were some of the best I ve ever had. The michelada was great and atmosphere was very relaxed and enjoyable  could have had better music though . PLUS  The second time we went we had to wait a little longer for our food and they gave us free queso and chips and were so attentive. Another highlight was the salsa bar. They have 4 housemade salsas that are made daily that you can self serve  my favorite is the hottest one  so amazing . Overall this might be one of my new go-tos in Austin. Highligh highly recommend 
Salsa Limn,24,My friend and I have been waiting for this spot to open near campus since a lot of places have been opening and closing due to COVID. We finally stopped in on a Friday afternoon for breakfast lunch. There are ordering kiosks to the left of the entrance inside that I wish I had noticed before ordering at the counter. The employees still seem a little lost and I tried ordering a breakfast burrito with bacon with a Bloody Maria sub vodka. With tip it ended up being  25 and I ended up with a regular burrito that had beans  rice and bacon. The burrito was still good but I was just disappointed when I was expecting breakfast. I didn t say anything because my food had already take awhile and I didn t want my friend to have to wait. She ordered chilaquiles and said it was good but spicier than she expected and before she could eat much of it her plate kind of looked like mush. The salsa was decent but it s a very small portion as pictured and it s not complimentary. The bloody Marias were really good and don t have that tomato juice texture that most bloody Marys have. The parking is very sparse so you may have to street park and walk if they are busy and I wouldn t come here with a big group. The patio looked nice but it was a little hot to sit outside. I would come back to try breakfast but I ll have to prepare for the price.
Salsa Limn,25,The tacos were super good   For me and my boyfriends first time we really enjoyed it and everything was delicious. I love the cheese added to the tortilla  Chips  amp  queso was also pretty good. Horchata was great  Only thing was it was a bit expensive our total for 2 people came out to  53. Which i find a bit much for just 2.
Salsa Limn,26,Upscale Chilachilas in Austin  The taste is exactly like the one I had in Mexico. Added chicken and it was great. It was accompanied by a La Baby - potato  cheese  refried beans  crema  avocado  sandwiched between corn tortillas - very filling and vegetarian for  5. There was also a house margarita - another winner  simple and not too sweet.
Salsa Limn,27,I will definitely go back very tasty.. Went for lunch but have to go back to for a drink and tacos.. Breakfast tacos all day is a plus.
Salsa Limn,28,Ordered the strawberry frozen marg  chicken taco  and barbacoa taco. It was a bit pricey at  20 for everything but overall everything was very tasty. They also have a salsa bar with very spicy habanero sauce which I I enjoyed but am still suffering from 10 mins later. So enjoy with caution
Salsa Limn,29,I try to visit Austin at least once a year  and I am always on the lookout for new  fun restaurants to explore. This place is in a great location  close to downtown and other pretty  walkable neighborhoods. The servers were enthusiastic and friendly  and helped me decide what to order. The wait time wasn t long at all and the seating was eclectic and comfortable. Very  Austin  vibe. The frozen margaritas were refreshing and delicious. I stayed classic with a burrito  but next time I ll be sure to check out the El Capitan  or the all day breakfast. Standout was also the guacamole  with the perfect balance of creamy and chunky  and full of lime flavor. I can t wait to head to this spot again next time I visit 
Salsa Limn,30,I was so excited for this opening. I drove past it every day and watched as the building got remodeled for the opening. I finally had the opportunity to try it yesterday and was really disappointed. I got the Capitan with asada  la baby with chorizo  and a barbacoa taco. I also had queso  which was probably the best thing on the menu  although the chips were too salty which is the opposite of most places  All the tacos were just bland. Not horrible  just not much flavor. I think my expectations were just too high. The corn tortillas were great but the flour tortillas were thin and just like the raw ones you get at the HEB refrigerated section. Very thin. I may try a return visit for breakfast tacos but honestly  I m not sure I want to go out of my way to try them. Very disappointed.
Salsa Limn,31,I go here far too often. The great food  and incredibly attentive staff keep me coming back.
Salsa Limn,32,Such a fun atmosphere  The cashier gave a great recommendation of the potato quesadilla as a vegetarian option  it was super tasty  especially dipped in the green sauce  overall  the service and food were both outstanding and I will definitely be visiting again soon 
Salsa Limn,33,I don t know if the cook knows how to make a taco. They were mediocre tacos but they took an hour with 4 customers in the restaurant. Plus it s 5 bucks a taco. Save your self time and money by going and getting tacos from a local truck. It ll be done in 5 minutes and half the price. Would not recommend to friends. Do not pass go. Do not collect 200 dollars 0 10 would not recommend
Salsa Limn,34,Capitan Asada  Barbar  are my go-to s  fresh  great margs and great atmosphere  must try.
Salsa Limn,35,This place is the real deal  food-wise and in all other ways. Austin has a bunch of taco places but none of them are as authentic as this one. The decor is so thought out  every detail makes being in there just feel nice. The service is excellent  and I especially love supporting a brown-owned  queer-owned Mexican restaurant  especially in Austin when so many Mexican places are owned by white people. The food is incredible  I especially love the La Baby  the chilaquiles  margaritas  and the micheladas. The patio makes it a pretty place to hang with friends on a nice day.
Salsa Limn,36,Bad  gross food  slow service  ordering confusing and they kept taking our numbers despite bringing out one dish at a time. Chef put some sort of sauerkraut on my quesadilla. For people who hate Mexican food  I would recommend Torchy s or anywhere else.
Salsa Limn,37,Chilaquiles and the tacos were awesome   Great food  drinks and vibes. Can t wait to go back.
Salsa Limn,38,Went to the grand opening last week and I m excited to come back and try their breakfast tacos  The food and the service were both fantastic. Our table got an assortment of tacos and salsas  along with a pitcher of margaritas. The Jalapeno and the Piquin salsas were both fantastic  the Jalapeno being the shining star  IMHO . It was a perfect balance of bright citrus with a kick on the backside. I enjoyed getting to meet the owner and hearing his story and food inspiration growing up in Oaxaca.
Salsa Limn,39,my first Salsa Lim n experience was awesome  i got the breakfast burrito w cheese and avocado   a pitcher of margs for some friends and everything was very fresh. the margs were sweet and not too strong. glad this spot opened up and looking forward to returning soon
El Pollo Rico,1,Unpretentious drive-through charcoal chicken in South Austin.  We always get the whole chicken meal  comes with fresh tortillas  grilled onions  brand  and rice. The price is far more reasonable than fancy hipster Mexican chicken places north of the river  and the taste is just as good.   They also do burgers and fries  but the chicken is what draws loyal fans.  I can t believe some bitter yelpers are complaining about poor customer service. This ain t no five star restaurant  it s a cheap and greasy neighborhood take out spot.
El Pollo Rico,2,Pretty greazy.  The only person able to speak English here was a very young entitled guy that obviously couldn t care less about taking care of customers.  The chips were awful  way way way too thick.  Drink was very diluted. Chicken was over priced.  Go to Sam s or Costco for a whole rotisserie chicken for under  5  every day.  Green sauce has a good flavor but it is super spicy hot.  Burns your tongue.  They don t have any salsa that isn t super hot.  Their borracho beans are good with cilantro but they shouldn t add pork.   They ve really gone up to unreasonable prices.  Come on man  
El Pollo Rico,3,Good food but the past two times their kitchen was closed an hour before the restaurant was. Change your hours if you stop making food at certain time.   We re still open but not making any food...Then Close. Pretty Simple Solution.   Just drove to another location to see if it was company wide. Nope just Oltorf.
El Pollo Rico,4,All of the sodas dont have many of the drink all it was is gas it felt like it was mostly water in my drink if this was the only restaurant in town I wouldn t go I would rather eat at home
El Pollo Rico,5,HORRIBLE SERVICE. THEY MADE ME WAIT FOR OVER 30 MINS FOR RAW CHICKEN  Then had the audacity to not want to refund my money. With proper receipts and matching cards   Will never eat here ever again. And ill rage a campaign of truth on this shit fuck chicken shit fuck ass place. Dont eat here.
El Pollo Rico,6,Great place for authentic  like your dad  amp  t os outside bbqing  meat. Super delicious  amp  satisfying.  amp  the drive through makes it an easy go-to when you don t feel like cooking.
El Pollo Rico,7,I always get the Rico Bowl - everything was off. Starting with my order being taken  then the person working the window... it goes on... you get the idea. The rice was  I ll just... say  strange   to be nice. I m not going to bash them  but definitely go to the one on Stassney  NIGHT AND DAY     
El Pollo Rico,8,Delicious 1 2 chicken meal. didn t disappoint  everything was yummy. rice was a little bland  but the bean sauce fixed that up nice. Very satisfied thanks to the cook. the chicken was perfect  note that Jamica was on menu but not available    definitely will be back
El Pollo Rico,9,Wow  I m pretty floored by this place. I ordered ONE  16 and two small sodas and the woman rang up 2  16 and two small sodas. My card got changed and I asked her why it was so much. She said two soups and I told her I only ordered one. They hadn t even made the soups yet and she told me she couldn t refund my card. That can t be true. I tried to protest but I was in a rush. If the manager or owner is reading this please respond with your policy to employee error.
El Pollo Rico,10,They close at 9 46  not 11pm as listed on Saturdays. The cook was nice enough to come out the back door after I was at the speaker for 3 minutes in total silence and tell me  we close it  and walk back in. Well....
El Pollo Rico,11,Here s a hint. When you order  put on your handbrake and turn off the car. This is not in anyway fast food.   I bought the MexMix... Chicken and what they consider fajita meat I guess.  I received a glorified wing and some sort of a breast thing. The wing was tasty  yet the breast thingy was so dry. The fajita meat was just a lil off  but my dog loved it. Not impressed for  11 and change.    I will say that the borracho beans are great  but I don t know any Hispanic that could eat the rice.   Just my opinion.
El Pollo Rico,12,We were craving a late breakfast and The places we wanted to try were closed so we pulled I here because of the full parking lot.  We ordered a whole chicken meal  grilled chicken with rice and bean. This is awesome grilled chicken  very tasty and very ethnic. And the staff are so friendly today.  Y all come and enjoy.
El Pollo Rico,13,I ve heard great things about this place and finally wanted to give it a try while in Austin.  I ordered the carne asada with charro beans and plantains.  The steak was very tender and flavorful.  They definitely give you plenty of tortillas too but they are not homemade.  The wife ordered chicken tostadas and she loved them.  The chicken had a ton of flavor.  You definitely get your money s worth as the food portions are not small.  The green sauce is phenomenal and I could eat it by the spoonful 
El Pollo Rico,14,As some of you may or may not know  the hamburger special at most Mexican restaurants is damn tasty.  There are several reasons for this   1.  They are usually hand made and not frozen patties  I m pretty sure the one at Pollo Rico falls into this category since the patty was not totally uniform--it had character .    b. They will usually be hot and fresh  since they are not often ordered  I had to pull forward and wait for my burger and fries today.  The fries were screaming hot  the burger was fresh off the grill .  iii.  They will taste more like a homemade hamburger  see item 1. .  All of these statements were true of the hamburger special at Pollo Rico.  The burger was so big  it is still sitting here half eaten and they gave me so many fries  half of them are sitting here as well  they may find themselves in a homemade breakfast taco tomorrow... .  They also gave me a HUGE pickled jalapeno  see photo .  I was a little to scared to use it  but it was an interesting condiment to include.  Oh  it was also a surprise cheeseburger  which was a pleasant surprise  since the menu clearly just said  hamburger special .    I am trying to try all the new menu items  though of course  the whole chicken special with the rice  beans  and big ole onion is the bomb.  I want to try the carne asada baked potato next time.  Also  this Pollo Rico has in-house seating  most of the locations are drive through only.      I will forever miss Al John s  the drive-thru and eat-in pizza place that used to be here  but if someone new had to move it  at least it was Pollo Rico.
El Pollo Rico,15,The food is delicious.   Great tacos    However they are always out of everything.  Twice now I ve gone and they were out of queso.   They said it s homemade    so it will take at least 10 minutes before it s ready.   So not sure how that works.  Like do you have to call ahead to order it     Today I went and they were out  so instead I ordered a taco and they said they were out of chicken as well.   So confused why they re open if they don t have anything on the menu.
El Pollo Rico,16,Probably the best beef fajita taco I have eaten at these Pollo...Regio  Rico....El Rey de Pollo restaurants.
El Pollo Rico,17,Eh. I ve never been to this location  as I usually go to the stassney location  but this one is very near my job so I went on my lunch break. Ordered 3 barbacoa  two pastor and one chicken - the pastor was decent and very flavorful but the barbacoa was so fatty that I gagged after biting into it. Huge strips of pure fat and fatty pieces - they took up like have the tacos. I also get their breakfast tacos sometimes and it s the same story - while the bacon and egg is tasty  the bacon pieces they use are sometimes all fat  to the point where I can t eat it without picking those pieces out because I will be sick. I wish the staff would take more care to trim the meats they use - a small amount of fat is okay but no one wants to bite into a huge slimy mouthful of fat. I ll stick to the stassney location - from what I can tell  it s far superior to this one.
El Pollo Rico,18,I get the family meal which is good for half a week or so. The family meal includes a whole chicken with an onion  tortillas  charro beans and rice along with red and green salsas. But the best thing is the creamy green sauce. You can make a chicken taco with onion and green sauce. I do recommend eating their chicken that way. If you do order the family meal  make sure you order extra beans and rice. The beans and rice which is included in the meal is not enough. This location has a drive thru although it does need a little technology update. The inside of the restaurant is bit of a dive but there is a salsa bar inside. Lo and behold  a big gallon of the green sauce.
El Pollo Rico,19,Went again cause it s close. Get home and no salsa called and they said if there s a jalapeno inside you dont get salsa . How the hell do I know which ones yall put a jalapeno in . So I should ask does a jalapeno come in it   Ridiculous . Salsa should come with everything . This place thinks it s salsa is gold   Other places have to go cups next to salsa and don t care what you take . Your better off going to any Mexican restaurant
El Pollo Rico,20,Rico bowlio.  The ladies are super friendly here and the service is always top notch.  One of the best fast food places i ve ever been too.
El Pollo Rico,21,I have had El Pollo Rico recommended to me many times before  but never really been up for it. Something about the  asada al carbon  on the sign... a Spanish title is par for the Mexican course  but the Spanish subtitle always kind of intimidated me  because it s like they re not even trying to communicate with non-hispanohablantes. But my friend and I were trying to work out a place to meet  and I said  any place that has good tacos around there    And here we are.  I ordered  13  the  taquitos  and since they re using accurate Spanish they really are just diminutive tacos  in a set of 5. The al pastor was magnificent. Well-seasoned  on fresh tortillas and there were 5 of them for  6. That s about the same as Taco Cabana s  street tacos  except they re made with higher-quality ingredients and an order gives you 5 instead of 3.  I also was very happy to discover  the sauce . I speak of the creamy spicy green jalape o sauce that I had never encountered before I was in Austin  but a few restaurants have. EPR s was not as creamy as Tacodeli s but the flavor was there  and any restaurant with  the sauce  is doing something thunderingly right in my book.  So far  so good... nice restaurant  good al pastor  tasty sauce. But when I was treated to my lunch companion s leftovers... daaaang. The chicken is very good. I consider myself an excellent griller of chicken at home. I always marinate  always use charcoal  and take pride in my crack-level-addictive chicken... and this chicken was astoundingly  tremendously better than my char-grilled chicken on the best day.  Great place for food. Not one to forget.
El Pollo Rico,22,Just straight up good grilled chicken. Enough said. Get a few pieces though because they re on the smaller side. The tacos are pretty decent as well. Give  em a try.
El Pollo Rico,23,Awesome place for a great meal with a great deal  The carne asada combo is delicious. My co-workers bought the chicken combo plates and they said it was really delicious  I will definitely come here for lunch another day on my out to lunch day from work. The best part is you can smell the good food when you drive by to it. Each meal comes with beans  rice  corn or flour tortillas. You get a lot food for one meal.  Don t be afraid of the place because the outside appearance if you judge a book by it s will only keep you away. If you don t judge you will find a treasure of great meals for a great price  The beans awesome too    I didn t get to eat the rice because I was full. But even the rice looked delicious.
El Pollo Rico,24,Great grilled chicken. The half chicken meal is already packaged up  you don t wait for them to grill a chicken   so it takes about 30 seconds to get served. Good for a short lunch.  They have other food  but it s not great. The sign says chicken 3 times  and has a picture of a chicken  so that s not a surprise.
El Pollo Rico,25,3 taco plate pollo y carne asada with refried beans and rice  added cheese and avocado to each taco for .25 cents each. Melon Agua fresca. They refused to sub charro beans for refried beans  ended up getting a less expensive meal just to avoid charros.  I liked the refried beans and the rice but its my fault for not clearly getting the answer to what is on the taco besides the meat   My carne asada taco was so full of tiny bits of chopped union that fused with the cheese it was unsalvageable   The chicken taco didn t have all the onions but it wasn t that great. 3 stars for the refried beans and rice but the tacos won t make me rush back.
El Pollo Rico,26,Decided to check out El Pollo Rico on a recent Austin trip because El Taquito was slammed with people... I should have just roughed out the crowd. When I pulled up they were out of a lot of things so I opted for their cinco taquitos. When I paid my  7  the attendant practically threw the plate in my window   gotta love that service  . The beef was dry and I noticed that compared with other photos that they were sheisty in the meat department. The green salsa was too hot to consume but I know of a lot of people who would love this. I ll try to make it back at an earlier time when there is more of a selection.
El Pollo Rico,27,I paid 9 bucks for a half chicken with rice n beans. And the chicken was super dry and very boney.  There was hardly any meat on it. Big rip off       I know sometimes they can be good or so I ve heard  i just dont know if thats currently the case anymore.  My experience was pretty tasteless.
El Pollo Rico,28,I ve tried almost every item on the menu and my top picks are the Chicken flautas  Torta combo  with beef   Papa asada  also with beef   Pollo asado plate  and the Carne asada plate. In that order. And all of these come with the salsa verse  green sauce . Which is amazing.  As far as the service goes  sure they could be speedier  but as for the reviews I ve read about the staff being tools  I ve never gotten mean-muggin  looks or unfriendly service. Oftentimes  I even get complimented on how cute my dog is. So I don t know what those people are talking about.  My suggestion  Try it for yourself. If you get shitty service then  yelp about it. Surely you won t be disappointed with the food  I never have been 
El Pollo Rico,29,I wanted some Mexican food to take home so I stopped at the drive thru and ordered the grilled chicken  amp  beef combo dinner.  Price was good - just over  10 including tax.   Everything was good. Green sauce is very spicy - red is mild.   You get a lot of food - chicken breast quarter  some strips of grilled fajita meat  rice  charro beans  corn tortillas  grilled onion  red  amp  green salsa  amp  1 2 lime.   The beef was slightly overcooked - but that s par for 95  of the Mexican restaurants out there.   I have not ever had better grilled chicken. It s marinated  amp  seasoned just right.   Their rice  amp  beans are also very good. Prices are fair for most meals. However  I think  15  for a whole chicken dinner is excessive. You can buy a whole rotisserie chicken from the grocery store for under  6.   Even though it comes with the sides - that s pretty high because the chicken pieces are not that big.   Great choice if you want a quick dinner to take home. I ve never dined inside so I can t speak for their sit down service.
El Pollo Rico,30,From out of town and doing laundry across the street  I was just going to a burger joint next door.  I saw the sign that said Charcoal Grilled Chicken.  What a treat  Great flavor perfectly grilled in a spicy but not hot marinade.  Did the half chicken combo  rice was good  but beans were great.  Came with limes  whole grilled onion  tortillas and both red and green sauces for about  10.  Try it if you can  you ll want more.  Going to try the Barbacoa next time.
El Pollo Rico,31,DO NOT go to this pollo Rico location  the people who work there are worthless.  It would honestly save you time to drive to the Stassney location.  On top of that I was given a menu with coupons And was accused of taking one of the coupons off of the counter to use  which isn t allowed   Seems like a bait and switch tactic and they were so rude I left.
El Pollo Rico,32,Got the half chicken meal and it was awesome I gotta say  Huge portion  and great authentic grilled-flavor to the chicken. Comes with a side of rice and beans  both were good. Would have preferred some mashed taters...  But this place is essentially a Mexican restaurant that seemingly specializes in grilled chicken. It s pretty close to my place and I ve wanted to try it for a little while now  definitely quality for your buck. Think I m a regular now.
El Pollo Rico,33,caldo de pollo terrible salty and greasy although the service is good  grill chicken very good.
El Pollo Rico,34,I love this place. They do an excellent job at grilling chicken. Today Im having the rico bowl which is full of tasty beef  ricea  beans corn and pico. Im here twice a week eatting up all this yummy food.
El Pollo Rico,35,I m not a chicken lover.  In fact  I flatly refused to eat chicken until I was in my late 20 s.  I have grown to tolerate it over time  but not love it.  So when Mister told me he was going to bring home a chicken dinner one night  I was less then enthusiastic  but he was excited so I went along with it.    Oh.  My.  God.  I LOVE this chicken.  Get the whole chicken combo  that s what we get .  It s amazing.  MORE than enough for two people  although we really need to get extra tortillas .  I have had it about five times now  and it s awesome every single time.  That s all I have had from here and probably all I ever will have because I love it too much to try anything else.    
El Pollo Rico,36,The mex mix is the bomb diggity.  Overall this place is always a solid choice. The chicken is great. Flavorful and chargrilled to perfection. The whole chicken meal is easily the best deal. The amount of food you get is fantastic  comes with rice  beans  tortillas and an whole roasted onion .   I haven t ventured too deep into the menu because the chicken by itself and the mex mix  carne asada and chicken combo  are soooo good  I haven t felt the need to stray from them   As a bonus  the HEB receipts from the the riverside location have a coupon on the back for a whole chicken meal for just  11.69.
El Pollo Rico,37,Please be careful yesturday i buy a chicken bowl 2 hour later after i eat it i star felling with head pain the hight fiver all the night i thing someone have a virus or the food was contaminate. This is the first time happen to me. I will never come back.
El Pollo Rico,38,El POLLO DELICIOSO        This place is amazing. The chicken will bring you in and the price will bring you back.   The whole charcoal grilled chicken with all of the sides  tortillas  beans  rice  a grilled onion  and limes for 16 bucks is an absolute steal. I have tried to buy all of these items at the store and I come out more expensive. The great thing about it is that you can get it from a drive thru. My girlfriend and I can each get 2 meals from the whole meal. If you don t have that many mouths to feed don t fret they also have a 1 2 chicken option.   If you like chicken and haven t tried this place give it a go  I guarantee you will not be disappointed.   I have also had one of the tortas when I was on lunch from work and they are also spot on but to be honest you would be doing yourself a disservice to not order the chicken.
El Pollo Rico,39,Save yourself sometime  amp  go to El Taquito On Riverside  First I go order  amp  ask for the 1A 2 piece chicken  I wanted two legs the lady taking my order said she can only give me a leg  amp  thigh.. okay I know what I m paying so why can t I have 2 legs either way I m paying more than I should so what s it matter   Get to the window I ordered a shake she then proceeds to tell me my meal comes with a fountain drink okay  well I want a shake I don t care if I pay extra  She made my whole order complicated  Now let s get to the food  It freaking sucks  The locations up north where the white people have better food   You d figure oltorf where Mexicans are they would have the good food  No  The chicken was burnt  the tortillas taste like HEB store bought BLEH  amp  The beans had more juice  amp  Veggies than it had beans  The rice was hard  amp  had no flavor   The only thing decent about my meal was the green sauce  Save your time just not worth it 
El Pollo Rico,40,Pollo Asado  roughly translates as Awesome Chicken   Don t even screw around and buy anything other than a whole chicken. It s what you want. It s what you need.  Pros  - Drive Thru - Green Sauce - Roasted Onion - Did I mention the green sauce  - Not super cheap  but not expensive for a 2-person meal  Cons  - What  Are you crazy 
El Pollo Rico,41,POllo Rico s green salsa is the bomb diggity. It s spicy but so delicious.  Their pollo asada and grilled fajitas are legit.  Rice and beans are also solid.  I m really picky with Mexican food but they ve got it down.  Their caldo de pollo makes my heart happy.  It s a sure fire way to make any cold day instantly better.  But  make sure and go early because they always seem to sell out. P.S. Supply and Demand is a real concept  Pollo Rico. Just saying.
El Pollo Rico,42,Looked on their website to make sure they had chips and queso before heading out  and their website said they did. Upon arrival my dreams were crushed  there is no queso. Just heads up  what s on the menu   may not actually be on the menu...just sayin . Have tissues ready.
El Pollo Rico,43,Came here for the first time and ordered their chicken meal which came with rice beans amp corn tortillas amp was delicious  however my boyfriend ordered some type of beef tortilla gyro thing and it make him sick for the rest of the night. The place seemed grimy  the cashier  didn t know  answers to any questions I had about the menu amp the tv was blaring so loud I could hardly hear while trying to order.
El Pollo Rico,44,There food would be a 4 out of 5. Have been here about 6 times and each of those I found the person running the drive through to be less then pleasant. I don t mind waiting 15 minutes in a drive through but a smile may help.
El Pollo Rico,45,I eat here around two or three times a month. It s awesome.   Granted  I am no rotisserie chicken connoisseur  it definitely beats HEB  or any other place in the area.   For a super cheap price  you get a ton of chicken  plus rice and beans. They have other typical mexican dishes too  but why bother when you can get the chicken   Everytime I ve gotten it  the chicken has been moist and full of flavor. It s great anytime we have guests in town and don t feel like cooking  we just grab a chicken or two    As far as fast food drive thrus go  I have to say  Pollo Rico is the best.
El Pollo Rico,46,Good chicken. But really shocked to find they started charging for extra salsa. 3 for a dollar. Which kinda peeved me since she failed to say that until after she ran my card.  I get it. Prices are going up. But the salsa cups are small to begin with. Salsa is not like a bbq packet at mcds. I drench my food in it. Like jerry seinfeld says it should be a condiment on the table...Right next to salt and pepper.
El Pollo Rico,47,Their tres beef tacos combo with green sauce is a flavor explosion  I d give 6 stars if I could 
El Pollo Rico,48,Isn t just delicious  is mamas kitchen  They are super natural  simple  friendly  tasty  and sincere food   That s just a little piece of what they offer  you had to be a genius to offer such simple ingredients on many good choices. Also some plus is the fast attention  They are really good at it  The salad and fresh same day made it salad bar  and chips   You have to  you should try it   I m 2 or 3 times a week costumer  and I love the chips l  I got there hungry  and I come out satisfy. That s why maybe I ve been seen some many non Latino costumes around  They price rocks and the food is awesome 
El Pollo Rico,49,This place is amazing. Everything I have ever eaten here was beyond perfect. The green sauce is my end all and be all  I usually get 3 or 4 tacos with either chicken or carne asada. Also  I occasionally grab the whole chicken meal on Fridays for Pollo Rico day with my co-workers. I will always be back here  the great smell of cooking fills the entire neighborhood and draws me in almost every time I pass by. The only downside I can find with this establishment is their slowly rising prices. I have noticed most items on the menu have increased by approximately  3 over the past couple of years. Overall  this place is a winner.
El Pollo Rico,50,This place has the worst customer service  we recently went and the girl at the drive thru was very rude she treated us in a rude way as if she hated her job.  It s a shame because the food is delicious  but the bad customer service kills any possibility of me ever returning here.
El Pollo Rico,51,I am currently dieting and The order taker was able to adjust my carne asada order so there weren t any rice and beans  and I got a salad with it instead.  The steak was really good  I had trouble trying to slow down and really chew through it  The salad came with the guacamole and sour cream I ordered and I dipped my steak with that. I really liked it.
El Pollo Rico,52,I had the Half Chicken for lunch today.  The chicken is very flavorful and there is plenty of food for at least a meal and a half.  I especially like the green sauce from the salsa bar.  4 stars for the food  minus 1 star for the cleaning chemicals smell when you walk in.  However  they gained a star back to bring it to 4 with the friendly service and free chips   
El Pollo Rico,53,Ate from here for the first time today loved it. The beef was savory without being greasy and it filled me up without being heavy.  Very light and fresh fare. Will go back often 
El Pollo Rico,54,The only word I can think of to describe this place is AMAZING I m crazy picky when it comes to chicken and this is definitely the best chicken I ve had
El Pollo Rico,55,Did you know there is a coupon on the back of HEB receipts for El Pollo Rico  A whole chicken combo meal for 11.69. It expires Nov 30 I think. Check your receipts  folks.   So today was the day  I wasn t feeling so well and left work early  and picked up my little package of goodies on my way home. Upon entering  my roomie s cats all suddenly appeared  looking at me hungrily. I had to fend them off. The chicken is pretty good  the dark meat far superior to the relatively dry white meat  which is kind of a bummer  I m hoping they aren t all like that. Both are flavorful though. I love the beans  they have bits of beef and chorizo along with big chunks of tomato and jalapeno. The rice is also very good. I guess I was expecting a larger portion of each  since I tend to think a whole chicken will feed four people  but I would say the give you enough rice and beans for two portions. It also came with a grilled onion  half a lime  and corn tortillas. Oh god  and the salsas. I asked for extra green sauce because I am pretty much just obsessed with it. I can eat it by the spoonful. And an update on the service  The problem mainly lies with the teenagers working here  which is hardly surprising. As long as the employee is above 20 or so the service is fine.
El Pollo Rico,56,I was craving rotisserie chicken and upon searching the internets this place came up. This is definitely some good tasting chicken  although it tasted a lot like Pakistani Indian tandoori chicken or a spicier El Pollo Loco instead of rotisserie. This is to no fault of the restaurant  of course. The full chicken came with rice  beans  salsa  and tortillas. The beans were AWESOME. Not your typical re-fried beans  but rather a pinto bean soup almost with spices and pieces of meat.
El Pollo Rico,57,This is an amazing place to eat. Prices are lower then I would have expected  and the food is unbelievable. I am a big fan of the food. If you are a working person and on a budget this is the place to go and eat lunch.
El Pollo Rico,58,After reading the yelp reviews  i went out to look for EPR  5 but found this  6 instead.  I ventured in to see their offerings.  It kinda is like a basic Pollo Loco as some others have descirbed it and no I am not from Cali  there are PL in other places in Texas   The lady at the counter was very friendly and helpful.  I got a two piece meal.  The chicken was tasty and did have the spice rub others had discussed  but the flame taste was kinda weak.  It was ok for me  but i guess I prefer a more of an asado grill taste.  The rub spice maybe took some of that flavor away.  The salsa s were ok  as was the grilled onion.  The beans were not too good  I think Taco Cabana does a better job and the rice was just eh rice  not the worst i have had.  So not terrible at least it wasn t dry  maybe i will try some of their other locations   Or maybe if it is cold out and rainy I will just go down the road to this location and see if it gets better.  Maybe the other options are great too   FYI they offer those awesome tostada chips that i freakin love  i could eat that with the salsa alone 
El Pollo Rico,59,love Rico. i enjoy their chicken and the tortas and the huge quesadilla.
El Rinconcito Del Sabor,1,The food here is definitely affordable and good. Definitely not a five star gourmet Mexican food if that s what you are looking for. The service is great every time I have come here. Their menudo is really good and made just right. I just wish there was more hominy along with all the meat. Most Mexican restaurants just serve a lot of meat.       I came here with my kids one evening because my wife had to work late. Needless to say my kids are typical kids. Picky about everything  this place has you covered even if you are Hispanic and your kids don t want to eat Mexican food.   They also make some delicious fajitas if that is your favorite Mexican dish. The chips and salsa are good too.   Parking can be breeze or a pain depending how packed the plaza gets.
El Rinconcito Del Sabor,2,We enjoyed our dinner at El Rinconcito Del Sabor. I ordered Pollo Asado. Everything was made fresh and was full of flavor. The salsas are great too. Service was nice and the staff was very friendly.
El Rinconcito Del Sabor,3,This corner place is a hidden gem  I just moved to the Austin area and looked around for some comfort food that tasted close to Mexican food. I ordered the pozole and queso flameado  cheese with chorizo  and I was blown away  I went in expecting Tex Mex and got an authentic Mexican dish experience. Don t even get me started on the horchata my oh my delicious. If you are craving close to home Mexican food this is your place  I will be back for dinner next time 
El Rinconcito Del Sabor,4,Just left this place after waiting for a waitress to attend me my daughter and wife and I ve never been more upset at a small local business before ... not only did the place look like someone s basement but after taking a while to attend us the lady approaches and says to us that because my daughter came in with a pizza  keep in mind that she s 4 years of age and a very picky eater so we knew she wouldn t eat anything there and picked her up something along the way  they told us we had to leave and couldn t eat there.... Fine. Don t want my business money or tip for the waitress  I don t care. But definitely will not be returning or recommending this place to anyone. What an embarrassing moment. Made us feel alienated. Never again 
El Rinconcito Del Sabor,5,A really nice and quiet hole in the wall restaurant. The staff is super friendly and attentive. The food was great  The queso and verde enchiladas definitely hit the spot    Will not be my last time coming here
El Rinconcito Del Sabor,6,Great local family restaurant and my favorite close by Mexican joint. Every time I go in  I am the only white guy there - I always take this as a good sign   Their salsa has a decent kick to it  and unlike a few other nearby Mexican restaurants  they do have a liquor license if you want a michelada or Bloody Maria. I get something different each visit  and it never fails to be delicious.   I would choose this spot for authenticity over nearby Tres Amigos  and the staff is a lot friendlier than Aguilar s across the street  plus they have booze here and serve food faster. Y es barato aqui 
El Rinconcito Del Sabor,7,This is the perfect spot for authentic Mexican food. The staff are fantastic and very attentive. Everything I ve tried is amazing but my favorites are their fajitas  tortas  breakfast tacos  flautas  and menudo  on weekends . Delicious margaritas and Mexican candies and treats are for sale at the register. This restaurant is a gem in this quickly developing neighborhood. Hope to see it around for a very long time 
El Rinconcito Del Sabor,8,Horrible food I have tried all kinds of food but this place I will not recommend to anyone even if it s the last place on earth my food arrived but nun of my tortillas came with it so I m sitting for at least 30 min before anyone ask if the food is ready and by the time they gave my tortillas to me I just put the container on top of my food and gave them my plate back because 30min for 2 tortillas was horrible and they still wanted to charge 2 dollars for the late tortillas but the End of the story is that no one come by asked about our food or told us if we need a refill so if your have a bad day here just don t stop here
El Rinconcito Del Sabor,9,Yummy cane guisada and they are sweet when i try my spanish. Great food  And they speak english too 
El Rinconcito Del Sabor,10,I think the 3-star is perfect for this restaurant. The service was extremely friendly  but the offerings  from the chips to the enchiladas were just A-OK. It was really affordable and service was quick. While I won t bring friends by while they are in town  I will stop by if I need a quick lunch.
El Rinconcito Del Sabor,11,It would ve been so much better if the indoor humidity had not been 100 . Needs a new A C.
El Rinconcito Del Sabor,12,Great taqueria  The green salsa gives me life and the chips are delicious   1 after the first complimentary bowl . I got a torta with lengua. The bread was perfect  the meat was delicious  and the side fries were good too. I m very happy I stopped by.
El Rinconcito Del Sabor,13,Whoop   ...We made the mark  ...100 different Mex Tex joints since we have started Yelping  ...One heck on An Adventure it has been  ...Needless to say the diet starts Jan 1...We have hammered a lot of new places out this last couple months  ...This place was a solid  very solid 3 stars....this was right across the street from the last place we hit...Service was outstanding   ....Everyone looked out for everyone else...Water  chips  etc. Team work is key in any restaurant today...Chips  Salsa and Queso hit the table...Once again a small portion of salsa  yet not complaining...had a great flavor  bite..and of course with a couple spoon fulls added to the queso...was a nice touch....Basics first...Beef enchiladas for the wife  and the Belly Buster for me  ...WwwHHHatt ...why do they make me feel guilty..Mine first...Well the Belly had enough room for the meal...2 crunchy Beef Tacos...shells were crunchy  not sure if they were home made...flavor was well above the Box bought at the store...Beef was a little light on flavor  But they were fresh  veggies cold and decent in size. Chicken Chiladas were delish....all white meat..still moist and flavorful...Now for the green sauce...NICE...Great flavor  tart and a bit of heat...Beans were creamy with just enough whole beans...Wifes beef Chiladas were packed out  came with the Tex-Mex sauce and worked well with the beef  gave it bit of boost in flavor...wife could have taken a bit more heat  but still a good flavor..Over all a great finish to a crazy Adventure   .
El Rinconcito Del Sabor,14,Not fresh food the corn tortillas weren t warmed up all the way. Not tasty food I ll say.
El Rinconcito Del Sabor,15,I cannot believe how horrible the serves is here. Now I know why you have no business.  We decided to surprise our dear friend  who has become homeless due to the Memorial Day flooding  with a baby shower to help her before her baby comes.  Thinking it was a good idea to go some place where its not too busy we chose El Rinconcito Del Sabor - Kyle   unfortunately we were not welcomed. The owner or manager whoever she was explained that we should have called ahead. By all means I totally understand and my apologize. I honestly didn t think it would be an issue. I mean the Facebook page does advertise walk-ins welcomed and parties of 6 or over get a free queso.. I didn t think it was an issue but now I know. Then she proceeds to say if you re going to eat here you all have to order a plate nothing al la cart and just have water.. Again okay weird but your rules.. Whatever..   Then what had all of us livid... 2 of our guest were disabled veterans  both served overseas  and both parked in the handicap parking. Well  the same lady tells another guest of ours to tell them they could not park there. My friend came to double check with the 2 vets and they confirmed that they have it on their plates they can park in that parking. Once my friend explained that it was on the plates they are able to park there  that woman then says well they look to young to be disabled veterans  in a tone that she did not believe it was true . OMG it was horrible.... Not that she was deserving both had furnished all credentials.. It took me to tell the waiter that he and that lady owed them an apology. Happy fourth of July      Not to mention we were told they could not split the check with over 6 credit cards. Needless to say we used 2 different cards and the rest in cash. That was a big mess and them trying to double charge.   Ritas were good  Food was edible  beans no flavor  Portions you get robbed...  Do not do large groups Better when it was Luvianos  Cute house and out door patio  I really hope someone takes over because this spot has so much potential. All posting from 2009-2013 are accurate.. Miss the old staff and not too sure if they hired a new cook. I thought it was the same owners of Luvianos but after last night not too sure.
El Rinconcito Del Sabor,16,This place was okay. Just okay. It wasn t delicious but it wasn t terrible either.  The chips though  those were not good. They were store bought.
El Rinconcito Del Sabor,17,Some of the best food I have had in Kyle. It s in a cute little house made into a restaurant  there s more outdoor seating then indoor. The food is very good  they don t have homemade tortillas but that s okay  the food more than makes up for it. The barbacoa place for breakfast is my favorite.
El Rinconcito Del Sabor,18,One of my favorite local eats  Always good quality food in a low key setting. From breakfast tacos to some of my favorite green sauce enchiladas  this is a great choice.
El Rinconcito Del Sabor,19,Good authentic Mexican food.  Good tacos and the chili rolleno were solid. This is not a 5 star restaurant so don t set your expectations to that of one. The staff is wonderful and friendly.
El Rinconcito Del Sabor,20,Everything I have ever had here has been excellent.  The prices are very reasonable  the waitstaff are all the sweetest ladies and the atmosphere is just what you d expect of a hidden gem hole-in-the-wall Mexican food place.   I have debated as to whether or not to review Luvianos  as it is one of my favorite places and I don t want all of you crowding my spot... but it s a New Year and I thought I d play nice and share.
El Rinconcito Del Sabor,21,This place has the best chicken verde enchiladas  The breakfast tacos and horchata are also great 
El Rinconcito Del Sabor,22,Ho hum....that kinda sums it up for me. Now before you dis me on my ho hum review  it s not my fault  A friend played up this place to be fabulous. It was average  only negative were the tortillas we stiff and not fresh. The chicken enchiladas were good  fresh chicken was great  the red sauce  ok. The small amount of unmelted cheese was just a garnish. The rice nothing special  the beans were really good. Oops...almost forgot the salsa...too smokey and roasted for my tastes. I almost felt like I was dipping chips in bbq sauce  now I know that will excite someone  I promise to go back and try the breakfast tacos soon...breakfast tacos can make or break a joint for sure   I will surely update my review then. 
El Rinconcito Del Sabor,23,Authentic Mexican restaurant. Friendly prompt bilingual service. The salsa was quite good... piquante  spicy  I enjoyed the  Pollo Diablo   Devil s Chicken  
El Rinconcito Del Sabor,24,I d give it a 3.5 maybe  more than a 4. It was good solid quality  just no frills  and the beans and potatoes were kinda bland  as was the salsa. I got the barbacoa breakfast platter. It was really large  The meat was very tender. The horchata was good too.
El Rinconcito Del Sabor,25,I work down the street and this place has awesome breakfast tacos. Plus you can t beat the price 3 for  2.99. What really makes it great is the salsa for the tacos.
El Rinconcito Del Sabor,26,Getting sick was not the flavor of Mexico I had in mind at the Cameron Rd location. After what must ve been 1 2 an hour  my to go order of chicken stew which sickened both me and my dining partner with stomach cramps - it was distastefully presented and nearly  impossible to eat consisting of about 2 boiled whole chicken quarters with skin on  almost a whole squash  a raw piece of corn  whole potato and ginormous carrot  none of which had the ROTTEN parts cut off prior to cooking - what   Gross. Take your dining plans elsewhere.
El Rinconcito Del Sabor,27,Owner recently changed the name of this place but we ve been having breakfast here for several years.  If I don t get nopalitos or huevos ranchero I get my  menudo fix  and their spinach omelette is lovely.
El Rinconcito Del Sabor,28,read the other s and then read this...... are you done  Good. So while my car was in the shop for 7 hours I went around town with my mother and for lunch we stopped at Luvianos. A cute mexican restraunt in the hood. Thats right I said  hood . Not to scare you away or anything but there are bars on the windows for a reason lol. I know cuz I went to a school in this neighborhood and did my share of wandering around on foot around the neighborhood. So yeah the food is good. I ordered the Pollo Asado  the chicken was very flat  so was my mother s carne asada steak flat. Flat as a crepe  not a pancake a crepe. Super flat. Ha  Not quite what i was expecting. Maybe its normal in Mexico for the meat to be flat  The rice was good the beans were bland the chips were stale. I have had better and I have had worse. Oh and the salsa...... pureed canned tomato s with some chiles. I know my salsa. I prefer it cold  chunky and made with fresh ingredients. It was room temp  way too much like tomato soup. Oh and not spicy enough. I didnt really plan to give a bad review  but It is what it is.
El Rinconcito Del Sabor,29,Very cheap excellent Mexican food. I ll be there again.
El Rinconcito Del Sabor,30,Cheap and good food I will go back just for the tomato paste salsa but really the food is good but the salsa is just ok.
El Rinconcito Del Sabor,31,my favorite Mexican restaurant.  My children s favorite Mexican restaurant. My wife s favorite Mexican restaurant. Need I say more 
El Rinconcito Del Sabor,32,Man oh man  This place is the bomb  I went for my first time today and i m going again  that s for sure. From the look outside you wouldn t expect it to be so adorable inside. There are things hanging from the ceiling  Mexican newspaper  dolls on wall  and Mexican candy. It s not a crowded place and that s why it s great. The staff is really sweet  but i m not sure if they know English. i had a friend translate for me just to be safe. Right when you sit down they give you complimentary chips and salsa  ask what you want to drink  then you order. I ordered the Tex-Mex cheese enchiladas. When I got my plate I was truly flabbergasted. It was a hug place with 1 3 rice AMAZING  1 3 Cheese enchiladas with some type of red salsa  FANTASTIC  and 1 3 beans  shooot  GREAT  are for 5.99    You need to go     You wont be let down 
El Rinconcito Del Sabor,33,We went here for the 3 for 2.99 breakfast taco deal that they advertise outside  only to get inside and see the same sign but in small writing that is only during the week.  The tacos weren t bad  wasn t much on the bacon personally.   They only have 1 sauce and it s the same sauce used for the chips  amp  salsa.   Sauce wasn t spicy enough for me.  For 5 breakfast tacos  1 tea   amp  1 water our total with tip and all was  20.  Service was pretty quick.   
El Pollo Rico,1,The food is always great   Fast  and courteous.  Best Mexican fast food restaurant ever   Get the Rico bowl   Chicken  amp  beef  
El Pollo Rico,2,This place used to be on my way home from work  and I can t tell you how many times I pull in last minute because I just can t resist their delicious chicken  rice  and beans. I practically lived off of el pollo rico for the 15 months that I passed it on my way home from work everyday. I moved further north and forgot about this place  but now that I m back in south Austin  I ll be adding this restaurant back into my weekly rotation.
El Pollo Rico,3,This is not your corporate fast food  The chicken is juicy and with a unique  rich flavor  exactly as advertised. The beef is solid but not outstanding  the baked potatoes were the same. Chicken is the star of the show  complemented beautifully by the fried plantains. Don t let the drive-thru lines scare you off  They ve got their system down  and you ll be out of there in no time 
El Pollo Rico,4,First I m going to go ahead and say it. This is the best chicken in the whole town. It s better than any fried chicken you can get  it s better than any chicken I ve had anywhere in all of Austin.   The whole chicken meal is not only good its a great deal. The price point is right on and your whole chicken comes with Charro Beans  Rice and Tortilla s. Wait there s more you also get green and red salsa     The green sauce is so good  Its one of the most delicious hot sauces I have ever had and I never get enough of it. In fact  writing this review is making me wish they were open late so I could stop in on the way home and pick up a whole chicken meal.  Sometimes when I drive through the intersection where they are located I can smell them cooking the chickens. I cant say I haven t immediately detoured to get one. If you happen to be Stassney and South 1st and you smell chickens do yourself a favor and detour for the chicken. You wont regret it 
El Pollo Rico,5,I love the roasted chicken  beans and rice barbacoa tacos and the nachos. For fast food  it s the best around.
El Pollo Rico,6,This is what I call fast food heaven   We order the whole chicken meal sometimes or if we are low carbing it we will pick up two whole chickens for  20 with no extra sides.  The chicken here is absolutely the best in the whole town.  I have tasted the other Mexican chicken competitors and they are not as good in my opinion.  The charcoal flavor mixed with the seasoning is pure perfection.  Then there is also the green sauce that will rock your taste buds.  I dip and drizzle my chicken in the green sauce.  The charro beans have chunks of meat in them  they are packed with flavor and taste like they have been stewing and cooking in your grandma s kitchen for days.    The prices are cheap too  especially if you are feeding a family. The large whole chicken mean with the large sides is  18 and can feed a family of 4.  For what El Pollo Rico does - they are literally as good as it gets 
El Pollo Rico,7,Fast  delicious  and very inexpensive.  I ve gone here about 4 times a week for the past year and I ve never had a bad experience.
El Pollo Rico,8,Love Pollo Rico  this location is always fresh and the staff is very kind. Great food great price
El Pollo Rico,9,Oh man  the reviews were right  The chicken meal is incredible  One of the best meals i ve had here in Austin. The rice and beans are great as well. And you get lots of food for the money
El Pollo Rico,10,We do take out here once a month  including   Whole grilled Chicken Charro Beans Rice Grilled Onion Lime Green Sauce  Chips.....OH My  the Green Sauce  OK..... 1 more Green Sauce....eso es todo.
El Pollo Rico,11,I got a order to go to share with my friends and they all love it the chicken was super fresh tender and the seasoning was on point.
El Pollo Rico,12,I absolutely love this place. I love the aroma driving up to it  the smoky meat smell filling the air. I love the charro beans  the rice  the chicken... and especially the carne.   Of course  as mentioned in other reviews  the green sauce is amazing.   BTW  never had any problem with the food here in over a number of years visiting. And Taco Cabana doesn t even qualify as Mexican food.
El Pollo Rico,13,Due to an afternoon encounter with El Pollo Rico I am now a FAT BASTARD. my girlfriend and I got the chicken and beef combo s and gorged ourselves into oblivion. That place is cheap and pretty good. Stay away from the beef and make sweet love to the succulent  juicy  smokey pollo.  Not fancy at all- but pretty good.
El Pollo Rico,14,Best food that has ever been handed to me through a car window  hands-down.  Get the half-chicken combo  or the whole chicken if you re with a friend.  The seasoning is so good that you will be licking your fingers and scraping the bones with your teeth  to the point that its almost embarrassing. Comes with a bowl of rice  beans with big chunks of fresh veggies  a stack of like 8 tortillas  two salsas  and a whole grilled onion.  Seriously awesome.
El Pollo Rico,15,I went to Rico for the first time for breakfast tacos. Food wise and price wise I think this place is great. My breakfast taco with egg  chorizo and potato was delicious and generous. However  as accuracy goes this place is not going to get your order right and you have to be ok with that. I actually ordered the above with cheese and didn t get it. It worked out because I don t think it needed cheese at all and if I go back I know that now. My other taco was missing a more important ingredient  egg  which is what makes it a breakfast taco . The menu says the breakfast taco comes with egg and one topping. So my assumption was if I order a breakfast taco with sausage it would be egg plus my included topping  sausage  and my add ons which they also didn t get right. So in summary  the one taco was delicious and filing and cheap BUT I wouldn t expect them to get your order exactly right since they got some potion of each of my tacos wrong. I will go back and next time I ll try to work out the ordering kink  could have been partially my fault as a first time customer.
El Pollo Rico,16,Today is Friday the 18 of October 2014 I purchased 2 beef tortas they girl there who had me the order I ve asked for a lime and some green sauce and she said that there were 1  extra for each item so I ve asked her I usually come here and they don t charge for them  She answered well I never seen you and I you want the items I gave you the price for them so I answered back can I speak to the manager and she said well he s not here so too bad and slammeed the drive thru window in my face  An I ve waited 15-20min to receive my food there was only 2 cars head of me got home at my food it s awful cold and with tomatoes when I ve asked her I didn t want tomatoes when I ve had order in the window  Never had this experience here before till today not satisfied with the your girl at all 
El Pollo Rico,17,we have been eating here for about 5 years now and it still tastes GREAT   consistent flavors and portions.  get the Papas Assadas  and a whole chicken  get xtra beans  to feed 3-4 hungry people and you won t be disappointed. price is well worth it.
El Pollo Rico,18,This place is fast and relatively cheap  but I d rather go to Taco Cabana for similar food at a better price.
El Pollo Rico,19,El Pollo Rico is the most awesome thing ever. For  15  you get a whole char-grilled chicken  rice  beans  tortillas  onion  and salsa. This chicken is pure ecstasy. The left-overs make a fantastic breakfast as well. Plus  this location has a drive-thru. Can life get any better  The next time you need to pick up dinner on the way home  stop here. It will not disappoint.
Aguilera's Mexican Restaurant,1,Aguilera s gets 5-stars due to speed of service  authenticity  and price for what you get   The staff was very friendly  and the food was made to order  very prompt with beverages  chips  amp  salsa  breakfast etc. . As someone that has spent a lot of my life in small  mom and pop Mexican restaurants  I enjoyed the quality and portion sizes of our food.   My fiancee and I ordered a few breakfast tacos  and they were loaded with delicious ingredients on our choice of corn flour tortillas  only  1.50 each . In the mornings before 11am I think  you can get 3 for  2.99 total  which would fill up any hungry customer. We ll definitely be back again for breakfast if we re nearby in town 
Aguilera's Mexican Restaurant,2,Great food  great price  great service. I felt like I was at my abuelas home. The family environment and the ridiculously affordable food combine for an amazing experience. Would recommend to literally anyone.
Aguilera's Mexican Restaurant,3,I m sad to report that I wouldn t recommend this restaurant  based on a recent taco order. I was there at 4pm on a weekday and tried to order the Carne Guisada tacos.  Not finished yet.   Okay  how about the Barbacoa   Not finished yet.   Bummer. How about the Al Pastor  Yes  But don t get too excited yet...the meat was dry as a bone  the pieces cut too large  and without much flavor  and unfortunately so were the  available  bistec tacos. Maybe the empty restaurant and lack of take-out orders should have been a head s up for me  I will say  however  that the one saving grace of my visit was the red salsa provided with the tacos--it was deliciously fresh  with onions  peppers and tomatoes  and packed a punch  but unfortunately still couldn t overcome the dryness of the taco meat.
Aguilera's Mexican Restaurant,4,Very good food  homemade tortillas. Family restaurant. Our server was cooking  serving  and taking care of her very well behaved child. Still did an amazing job. Very good atmosphere. Overall amazing food  good atmosphere  and nice  hardworking owners.
Aguilera's Mexican Restaurant,5,This spot is serving without wearing their masks correctly or not wearing them at all  The lady that was prepping my meal got mad when I asked for the sides that came with my plate which was a salad  guac  and sour cream  She said that the salad was all and I pulled up the menu and said that is not what it states here and she threw whatever she had in her hand with an attitude and kept arguing with me as she walked back to get what was missing. I highly do not recommend this place  Their is several other spots in very close proximity  Give them a try instead 
Aguilera's Mexican Restaurant,6,I got my order to go. The cashier was polite but not friendly. The food was hot and fresh. I had to ask for a menu  as this was my first time to visit. Last time also. They gave a great amount of cheese on the enchaladas which is a plus. The beef inside the enchaladas lacked flavor for me. The rice and beans were very bland to me. For the price you got a good amount of food. They make their own turgid las which is a plus also.
Aguilera's Mexican Restaurant,7,Stopped in for a quick dinner with my husband before driving back to Denton - always a shame to leave Austin without grabbing some Mexican food  We d never been here before  but this place did not disappoint.   The atmosphere was relaxed and unpretentious - f tbol on the TV the entire time  dudes chilling with beers and micheladas watching the game. It was pleasantly cool after a hot day outside  plus nice and clean.  The food was very authentic  served up fast and hot. The chips and salsa were complimentary  not always a given at an authentic Mexican restaurant  that s kind of a gringo thing  and delicious - warm chips  spicy and flavorful salsa with excellent texture. Our entrees were simple and super tasty. I had the cheese chile relleno  hubs had the chicken enchiladas with red sauce. Both came with rice  beans  and salad  lettuce  onion  tomato  and ripe avocado . Didn t take any before pics of our meal  but did snap shots before we loaded our to-go box.  Service was friendly and fast  too. We were in and out in about thirty minutes.
Aguilera's Mexican Restaurant,8,Hidden gem. The real deal. Better than hipster torchys or all those other gringo joints.
Aguilera's Mexican Restaurant,9,This place is definitely gem  I wish I could give more than 5 stars  Haven t find a good enchilada around in Texas until I find this place  Lifesaver     highly recommend
Aguilera's Mexican Restaurant,10,  99  Closer and Closer to the  100 mark...and were not disappointed with this find  ...Not many reviews  most seam solid...I will say Customer service was spot on ...Exactly what we look for  ...Chips  Queso and Salsa hit the table...Queso was good  and priced great for the size...Salsa was fresh and hit the spot....Our new thing these days is to add a spoonful of the salsa to the queso...and it always seams to work  and this round was no exception ...Sadly I missed out on the  Green Stuff  I have read about in the reviews...Hot plates hit the table  wife with the usual Beef Enchiladas  double rice...This would be the second time  ever  we came across a potato filler in the beef  yet this time around they were small  diced and were a good fit  a bit of carrot as well...and the wife is truly NOT a fan of this  BUT....the Spicy Chipotle Sauce is seriously good and one heck of a bit   ..She was lost in flavor to complain about it too much...Corn tortillas were thick...and they were packed out...Same on my side  except I went with Chicken with green sauce...Chicken was Whole Bird  which is my favorite for the entire flavor experience...Green sauce was tart  and a very nice punch on the the spice pallet...Beans were creamy with a few small chunks of whole beans...All around a great meal for this Tiny Strip mall Eatery  
Aguilera's Mexican Restaurant,11,Update 10 19 19 - tried this place again and it is just as disgusting as it was the last time. The service hasn t gotten any better either   This place is in walking distance from my home. I will never work there again. To start off with  the chips they gave me were stale and seem to be stale.  Probably out of a bag. The Horchata I had was good but you could tell it was a cheap mix. The waitress that served me seemed really annoyed with me because I did not speak Spanish and she had to speak English. She made it very obvious that I was inconveniencing her. I have had waitresses before that did not speak English very well  but they were kind and patient about it  as were I. This woman was just awful. She did not even smile at me once. I ordered the chili rellenos...beef. What came to my table was a poor excuse for authentic Mexican cuisine. It was incredibly greasy  the ground beef had chunks of potato and carrots in it. The top of the chili  there was a layer of what tasted like canned tomatoes  not even hot...lukewarm  covered in cheese. I got through three bites and couldn t go any more and I am not a picky eater. When I went to pay the same warm  welcoming waitress I had took my money  gave me my change and left to the back  all without saying thank you  or smiling  or asking me how everything was. She was awful.... I wonder if I accidentally ran over her dog and didn t know about it or something.  This was one of the most horrid dining experiences I ve had and if zero were an option I d give that. Honestly  I don t understand all the positive reviews about this place
Aguilera's Mexican Restaurant,12,This place is great for breakfast brunch. We ordered bistec tacos and pozole which were both amazing  Super good micheladas too
Aguilera's Mexican Restaurant,13,It s sort of hard for me to review because this isn t my favorite style of food. That said  the portions were generous and I think that if you re really into tex-mex then you should definitely check this place out.  In my opinion  good tex-mex should be served in a divey restaurant with tons of Mexican kitsch on the walls and Aguilera s delivers on that.  Some highlights  surprisingly great waitress  the best salsa I ve had in Austin  and queso that was surprisingly good. Don t get me wrong  no one would come here for the queso  the way one might with Kerbey Lane  Trudy s  or Torchy s  but it s not a waste of money to order if you re already here.  We went for dinner on a Sunday and the place was pretty dead  also  they were out of lengua . Hopefully  as the Mueller area starts to grow  places like this get more business.
Aguilera's Mexican Restaurant,14,Home Made tortillas  corn or flour  and that green stuff. Aguilera s has the right makings for taco heaven. The egg  chorizo and cheese breakfast taco was great. Not oily at all. And the Migas tacos were very good. They worked out even better by dousing them in a side of chile con queso and the Jalapeno taco salsa.   You need to drive out into north east side of town to find the trip mall which spawned this little dive  but it is worth it. I was hoping to try their Lengua but unfortunately they were out.  They have squeeze bottles of a good Valentina salsa which I could imaging going great on their meat tacos.
Aguilera's Mexican Restaurant,15,I always looking for that great hole in the wall mexican joint and this is one of them.  Their pastor tacos are soo good i keep coming back for more
Aguilera's Mexican Restaurant,16,I love eating here. I ve been eating at this spot since I was in high school  It was named Arturo s at the time . Great food. Real Mexican food. And pieces are great.
Aguilera's Mexican Restaurant,17,Customer service was TERRIBLE. FYI this is coming from someone who has never complained and just downloaded the yelp app for this specific experience.  As I walked in there was a woman just staring at me standing behind the counter. I said  hello  how are you   She then very angrily asked if I wanted a menu. I said  yes please . I thought maybe she was stressed or having a bad day so I brushed it off. Then as I was reading the menu she stood so close to me I could literally feel her breathing. I asked if I could get three orders of the three breakfast tacos for 2.99 and started listing what I wanted. She interrupted me by raising her voice saying  cheese costs extra     I said  that s fine and she quickly walked off before I was done ordering. I told her I needed to order two more orders and she rolled her eyes. When my food was done  she threw the bag of tacos on the counter and said  HERE . I said thank you as I left and she ignored me walking back to the kitchen.  BTW I tipped this place before ordering food      And food was not good at all.
Aguilera's Mexican Restaurant,18,Great pastor tacos    I also love getting the gorditas with steak. If you like authentic Mexican food  this place is a great spot.
Aguilera's Mexican Restaurant,19,I am a long time returning customer and I can confidently tell you that this is a true hidden gem  The service is always friendly  they are almost always open  the food is authentic and DELICIOUS  The steak a la mexicana is my all-time favorite dish.
Aguilera's Mexican Restaurant,20,I don t know when Tex-Mex became a bad word but I know a good plate of food when I eat it.  I had the Enchiladas Aquileria  their lunch special on a Friday.  3 enchiladas rice and beans  pretty much what I grew up on in south Texas.  Choose from cheese  chicken or beef and pick the sauce.  I had the beef with the red sauce and all was seasoned perfect and covered cheese.  The rice was cooked right and had pieces of carrot  peas  and corn which is the way I like it.  I m not big on refried beans but they were also good.  The chips and salsa was on point.  Warm chips and very good salsa with a little heat.  The place is clean with newer tables and chairs.  I don t leave a lot of reviews but I use yelp a lot to find lunch on different parts of town.  What I know is if you do not eat at places like this they go away and you are stuck trying to figure out where to eat. Give it a try  service was good and the food is even better.
Aguilera's Mexican Restaurant,21,Had some bidness to tend on that side of town  so I thought I would look up Arturo s Tacqueria...I had an ill-fated date that lived in the area and we had our last breakfast here...remembered the food was good but the companionship lacking...  It isn t Arturo anymore...it s La Laguna. Strip center with the Texan Market a couple doors down. Healthy portions  breakfast all day. The Ranchera sauce they serve con Huevos has nopales. Good stuff. The hot sauce is pretty darned good...fresh and full of garlic and cilantro  well blended. Chips were served nice and hot. Some of the best I have had recently. The papas...diced and fried...extra tasty. The migas had plenty of fresh chopped jalapenos and mild cheese. More tortilla chips than the average miga meal in town  but was tasty nonetheless. The seafood soup as well as Caldo de Pollo and Caldo de Res are totally worth having in addition to the Shrimp cocktail...generous servings. Quick service.
Aguilera's Mexican Restaurant,22,The service was pretty quick. Staff was friendly. I had a potato  bacon  egg and cheese burrito and everything was very good 
Aguilera's Mexican Restaurant,23,Food was decent  Carne asada  rice and beans lacked flavor. Server took our order and waited 45 mins for food even though there were only 4 other people there.   service was really slow  took our server about 15 mins to separate our check and have us pay for our food
Aguilera's Mexican Restaurant,24,We had a total of 5 pretty good sized tacos  amp  drinks for  8.  It was very good.  They do not have sweet tea and to me that was the only downfall.  Their regular tea is very good though just add a little sugar or sweet  amp  low.    I got the 3 breakfast tacos for  1.99 it s a very good price  but you do have to get 3 of the same kind of tacos.  No mixing it up.  It was okay because my partner was with me and he ordered 2 different tacos so we were able to trade and try a bit of everything.  The food was very good including the red  amp  green salsa.  The green salsa is the kind that i really love and hadn t been able to find in this area yet since moving here.  It s VERY spicy.    The company is actually called La Laguna now instead of Auilera s.  We will absolutely be returning.
Aguilera's Mexican Restaurant,25,I am obsessed w authentic Mexican tacos  and I am assuming this is almost as close as you can get  besides driving across the border  Try the lengua taco  My taste buds go crazy for it 
Aguilera's Mexican Restaurant,26,ok  this is as good as it gets for cheap authentic Mexican food.  I am talking 2.50 breakfast plates  with two eggs  potatoes  homeade refried beans....yyuumm so delicous.  I like downscale places like this for the everyday  it s quick and it is always homeade.  I have never been disappointed after eating here.  My favorite is the La Lagunero plate  two eggs sunny-side up over two homeade corn tortillas  or flour  your preference  with white cheese on top... I always request some ranchero sauce on top if that and it is the perfect breakfast dish. The coffee is always fresh and never ever tastes stale.
Aguilera's Mexican Restaurant,27,Work at the nearby Adesa auction and stepped out for lunch last week. This is a very unassuming place in a small strip center. The inside is fairly bland and kinda feels like you re sitting in the den of someone s house that hasn t yet been made to feel like home. Then the waitress promptly brought me super fresh chips and delicious salsa. She took my order and kept my drink and chips salsa topped off. The  Especial  was Enchiladas for 5.99. I ordered the chicken mole enchilada plate. They brought out a huge plate with lots of rice and beans and three smoking hot homemade chicken mole enchiladas with a mound of lettuce and avocado. They had some awesome green sauce in bottles upon request. This place is super reasonable with delicious food and giant portions. They will be seeing much...much more of me.
Aguilera's Mexican Restaurant,28,This restaurant really needs to be rated on different categories. Value is a 5  Atmosphere a 2  Food- 3  maybe 4 on somethings like their chicken soup  and service an inconsistent 2 sometimes 4. Overall a good place to eat a good meal and get out. Oh and of course I frequent the fresh made to order breakfast tacos on homemade tortillas.
Tortas El Guero,1,I got off of work late today. The last thing I wanna do is cook. So I came to tortas el Guero and they are honestly the best Mexican style tortas. Number one is my favorite. The food is prepared as you order it so everything is fresh and the cook is Very generous with the ingredients. They have outdoor seating and of course they also make to go orders and you can always have a cold drink with your meal. I am in love with this please oh and did I mention that it s very economic I got to hold meals for  19
Tortas El Guero,2,Solid Torta place located off Cameron road  just a short jaunt north of downtown. Keep in mind it s cash only but this place was great.   A lot of places around Austin tend to put beans in their Tortas which makes them heavy in book. So I always tend to prefer that go a fresher route. Avocado is always a better route.   Got the Diabla  6  Milanesa  breaded chicken cutlet   chorizo  avocado  cheese and egg  in an omelette form . Sandwich was big and super reasonably priced at  6.50. Really have to say these Tortas go amazing with hot sauce  and I finished mine up without it feeling heavy. Was surprisingly good  no fuss.   They have a ton of different combos you can do  and they only get crazier than what I listed. Bring your appetite for sure 
Tortas El Guero,3,Stop for this School Bus     Tortas El Guero is in the parking lot with Guthrie Cleaners located on Cameron Rd behind Capital Plaza.  I had a  2.50 chicken fajita taco and a  5.00 chicken quesadilla.  WOW   The chicken fajita taco was served street style...but the serving was generous and well worth  2.50.  The quesadilla was cooked perfect with just the right amount of crisp.  They do not skimp on the cheese either.  It had the right amount of melted cheese to be enjoyed with each bite.  My favorite part is that they add fresh sliced avocados to the quesadillas. The homemade hot sauce was very enjoyable too.  Tips   They are closed on Wednesdays and only take Cash.
Tortas El Guero,4,This was really good and they where really nice all my friends like coming here recommended   And the Tortas where soo delicious
Tortas El Guero,5,Best street food in town no doubt the tortas are the best and guero is a really laid back person
Tortas El Guero,6,These tortas are amazing  Had the  1  Cubana  and it is probably the best torta I ever had.  Highly recommended   
Tortas El Guero,7,Good tacos great price the meat is chopped fine that s the best way to do street tacos   more of the meat gets seasoning so more flavor .
Tortas El Guero,8,These are great tortas. A friend of mine and I went by here after enjoying Nomad s happy hour  the synergy between drunk food and newly-drunk people has got to be one of the most fertile entrepreneurial territories in Austin or anywhere   and were quite impressed.  He got a  2 Napolitana for  6  which came with milanesa  pork leg  ham  and cheese  plus the usual fillings. I got a  6 Diabla for  7  which came with milanesa  chorizo  ham  cheese  and eggs.  They came out in less than 10 minutes  huge  fresh  and smelling great in their large crusty rolls. We did the obligatory halfsies trade  doused our respective torta chunks in their  excellent  hot sauce  and enjoyed some great drunk food. Not quite as good as the ones at Mi Tradicion  but then Mi Tradicion isn t stumbling distance away from a bar  either.
Tortas El Guero,9,Tortas El Guero was around before food trucks were cool. These guys have been doing their mini-school bus thing for well on a couple of years. I ve always been impressed by the quality of the food they re pumping out of this spot.   This last go round I got a quesadilla with fajita and a sincronizada. The quesadilla was gigantic  stuffed full of fajita  beans  jalapenos and tomatoes. The flavor on those babies is reminiscent of Mexico... and not of dry chicken breast and mozzarella like most places where you order up that particular item. Their sincronizada is different than what I m used to -- but equally tasty. Ham  cheese and beans between two flour tortillas. Dip it in their legendary green salsa or the smokier tomato based one and it s all you can do not to cram more in your pie hole.  Prices are great -- those two items costing me  8 -- and they are ready super fast. Definitely a stop to make if you re at Nomad or Animal Trustees for a filling  inexpensive  local meal.
Tortas El Guero,10,Yet another entry in the ever expanding food truck scene in Austin.   I expected tacos but was pleasantly surprised by El Guero.   Although they do have a few tacos on the menu  they specialize in Mexico City style tortas  which are basically some really big sandwiches with a load of toppings.   Having never experienced an authentic Mexico City style torta  I asked what was recommended and the cook advised to order a  1 and a  7.   The  1 consists of cuban breaded steak  shredded pork leg  ham  franks  yes  hotdogs   mozzarella cheese and some veggies.   Yes  all that stuff on one sandwich    The  7 is chlanga steak  chorizo  cheese and veggies.   All sandwiches are served with pickled jalapenos  on them or on the side  and are accompanied by a very spicy chipotle sauce.  All tortas are served on really good bread  which is lightly toasted and buttered.   I can t speak to how authentic these are  or what the difference between a Cuban style torta and a Mexico City style torta is  but they were really tasty.  They are also huge      Mexican Cokes and Fanta are available and they have a number of covered tables for your dining pleasure.   Have a torta and then walk over the Nomad s for a nightcap.     Really different for taco truck fare and quite good.   They have a wide range of toppings  so check the menu picture I uploaded.
Tortas El Guero,11,Great tasting tortas around. Made just like you find in Mexico city   D.F.  The menu is very small and limited but it makes for quick and speedy service. Eating here is very limited  only two picnic benches. Most customers take theirs to go. I intend to stay there  enjoy my meal with nice weather  and indulge in small talk with other customers or owner.
Tortas El Guero,12,I REALLY wanted to like this place. I ve driven past it so many times and wanted to stop. Finally the other night I had my chance. I parked my scooter while being stared at by the customers  evidently they don t get many customers on scooters . I went up to the trailer to look at the menu board  understanding most  but not all of the Spanish. I was just about to look up a mysterious word or two on my handy  iPhone translation app when a very nice man that was waiting for his order pointed out they also had a menu board in English. I smiled and thanked him but was grumbling inside about not getting to use my new app.  Anyway  I ordered the Napolitana torta  breaded steak  pork  ham  cheese . I ve had several tortas around town and these were different. Personally  not my style. It didn t taste bad  just not anything I would go back and try again. I give them 3 stars instead of 2 because they were very nice and their food stand was a cool school short bus   
Tortas El Guero,13,Super nice staff and the food was amazing  Definitely recommend. Authentic  I got the steak tacos with avocado and cheese. The salsa is spicy and incredible 
Tortas El Guero,14,This place is great. The tortas are on point and the sauces he has are tasty. White people like to complain about stupid little shit at places like this and they don t even know how the god damn food is supposed to be. They don t come from the culture so how can they be the authority on Mexican cuisine   I m sick of these babies  This place rules get over it 
Aparicios,1,Ladies and gentlemen of Leander  hear my story of the greatest restaurant  and hero who owns it. I went to the Leander Trunk or Treat this weekend with my kids  and my son locked the doors before I could get the keys  my phone and purse out. This was in front of Aparicio s. I walked the kids to the event  we walked back and I was going to eat there after  but we couldn t get the car unlocked. My dearest friend who brought her kids and family took my kids home  and I waited for a tow truck. Thanks to my smartwatch I could call one  but that s a separate story. Smart watches work  but they aren t great if they aren t close to the phone  so I had to stay near my car.   And I waited... And I waited some more...  Finally after an hour  a kind man walked out of Aparicio s named Victor. He s the owner.  He offered me a strawberry lime-aid  and a chicken taco. He fed me  he told me about his restaurant and his food truck  and asked for nothing. And as the hours ticked by because it was getting outrageiously cold  he finally told me he would help me get  a locksmith since my tow truck never came.    He fed me  he got me warm  and he helped me get safe and had someone get my car open. Superman never fed anyone  so in my book  Victor is greater than Superman.   Now let s talk about the food. Not only was that the best chicken taco I ever had  and I ve had many  the tortilla was fresh and fantastic. This is authentic food  not frozen  not preformed tortillas  but made by hand in house. That alone is worth it. From the amazing Scarface homage to the way that everything is perfectly clean  to the beautiful presentation of the food  this is probably the greatest place to eat in Leander. It s in that same spot that Farm to Fork used to have. I highly recommend it.   I brought my husband back the pastor taco  and he s in heaven as I type this. It s delicious    If you are into authentic Mexican food  that is fresh  seasoned perfectly  and made to order  this is your new spot  as it is surely mine. The portion size makes sense for the pricing  and the iced coffee horchata is to divine and I can t wait to try the quesadillas.   So not only did my life get saved  I once again have the perfect place to get real tacos in my life.   Victor you are a hero  and an amazing chef. Thank you for everything. I will be back and with my kids and I promise  we will not lock ourselves out of the car again.   
Aparicios,2,Wow  Had the pastor tacos and a Horchata there tonight and it was excellent. Love the homemade corn tortillas - the pastor filling was so flavorful and yummy with generous touches of pineapple and cilantro. The Horchata was deliciously rich  silky and creamy and not overly sweet.   Friendly service with a smile. I ll definitely be back to try some other items on the menu.
Aparicios,3,The machetes are expensive for the amount of meat they have but they are good size and the tortilla for it is really good.  Salsas are ok.
Aparicios,4,Aparicios is now doing breakfast on Saturday and Sundays   This stuff is soooo good. They have breakfast tacos   both regular size and machete  along with Chilaquiles.  The OJ is fresh squeezed and the Iced Coffee Horchata is da bomb.   If you re looking for authentic Mexican - do yourself a favor and checkout Aparicios. The staff is always looking to try new things and receive feedback and it s such a friendly place.   Located off of Hero Way in Leander - the restaurant is towards the back   actually a side store  of a small strip mall. Look hard - you will be rewarded 
Aparicios,5,Drinks - Amazing  Food - full of flavor and fantastic  Service - great   The mood - chill and relaxed  Do not pass this place up. It is definitely a hidden gem.
Aparicios,6,I had the Gansito shake. If you re unfamiliar with Gansitos  they re a Mexican snack cake filled with strawberry jelly and cream and coated with chocolate. The shake s texture is great and it tastes exactly like a Gansito. It s topped with whipped cream and fresh strawberries  and also comes with an entire Gansito  It was really tasty and so big. I couldn t finish it in one sitting  but I was happy to save it in my freezer and enjoyed having it for dessert the next day.
Aparicios,7,Holy hot Cheetos batman    Aparicio s is great  everything has some sort of hot Cheeto aspect be it a tortilla made of hot Cheetos or just it being covered in hot Cheetos or sometimes both.   The Machete s are huge there s enough food for two people to share.   The shakes are also super tasty.   This is a very cool spot. Go here 
Aparicios,8,Aparicios is a food truck off of Runberg and Georgian drive. There s parking to accommodate for about 8-10 cars.   We originally went to Aparicios to try their  antojitos  and decided to try their food while we were there.   Shakes - we got the Ping ino shake and the Gansito shake. The portions are generous and one shake is enough for two people. We each had more than half our shake leftover. The Ping ino shake tasted like a normal cookies and cream shake. The Gansito shake tasted just like a Gansito... and it had a full Gansito inverted into it  If you ve never had a Gansito  just imagine vanilla bread  filled with just enough strawberry jam  covered in chocolate and add little chocolate bits to it. So yummy   As far as the food goes - it was good but it wasn t great  to be completely transparent. The machete is massive  2 ft    You can get two flavors and they ll split it right down the middle. We liked the Carne Asada with hot Cheetos more than the al pastor.  There was no line when we got there. Staff is friendly and service was fast  it probably took about 10 minutes to order and get our food. Staff is wearing masks and they have hand sanitizer readily available. I don t think we d go back for more food but would definitely go back to try more of their antojitos.
Aparicios,9,Sadly they were out of the  Machete  but the Texas sized carne asada tacos were very good which def makes me more confident about buying the Machete. I literally had 2 blue lagoon limeades in a 30 min period..I got one and barely got down the street then realized it was almost gone and I needed to turn back for another. This was Saturday..I was back shortly after opening time Sunday for another one..Saturday s were much better but it was still good. My co-eater had the hot Cheetos elotes which we both liked but agreed they may have overdone on the Cheeto topping. She had the strawberry limeade which was also very good but couldn t top the blue. When we returned Sunday she bought both and combined the two which was outta this world. This place is def worth a try  the turn is quick so be careful not to pass it.
Aparicios,10,My sister-in-law recommended this place after seeing all the delicious food pictures on social media  LOL. Since we live in Buda  we travelled quite a ways to sample this little food truck. It s permanently placed in a small parking lot with a couple other establishments in the Hispanic part of town in north Austin. They have constructed a patio-like area with picnic tables to eat at for their customers.  We placed our order and weren t kept waiting long. I shared a machete with my mom because wow were they BIG  My brother didn t realize the drink he ordered would be spicy and humbly requested something else  and the staff decided to bring out FIVE additional drinks to let us ALL try their unique beverages  the sweet ones that white folks can handle LOL   which was really awesome of them  Basically  25 worth of drinks on the house. They wanted to make a good impression  I think... But all the drinks were delicious  I especially enjoyed the passion fruit variety.  My only complaint was how loud the music was blaring the entire time. I suspect they might ve been attempting to drown out the road noise from the street nearby but I could barely talk to my family while we were there.
Aparicios,11,Amongst a plethora of taco stands in Austin  this one is certainly unique. My partner tried the carne asada machete. It was  20 but filled two plates. It was quite good.   He sent me back the next night and let me know he wouldn t be sharing   I ordered the hot Cheetos taco plate al pastor. It was also good. The Cheetos come on the side to stay crisp and YES I put them on there. I ll try something different next time  but ya just gotta  you know   The shakes are gargantuan  much too much for this ice cream lover. They were impressive  nonetheless.   We ll be back when my partner gets the craving and I ll be happy to work my way through other menu items. Also  prices are on the high side for a taco stands IMHO  but I guess they win as I ll be back.
Aparicios,12,A really fun and creative food truck  I saw they had footlong tacos so my boyfriend and I came here on a Saturday night. It got pretty busy  They gave us a sample of all of their meats  and they were so tender and delicious. We were told we could do half and half foot-long taco  so we got half al pastor  amp  half carne asada. We added hot cheetos to it as well. The truck had an awesome playlist and had a lot of tables to spread out and eat. I saw they had a lot of milkshake options as well. So random but I m here for it  If I am in the area again I would definitely stop by  Our taco was delicious and so filling  we didn t have the opportunity to try anything else.
Aparicios,13,We are a family of 5 and was hoping this place was going to be good. We went to their new location in Leander on Saturday at 5 30 for dinner. Ordered 2 carne asada tacos  cheese quesadilla  hot Cheetos quesadilla  chicken quesadilla  Texas sized carne asada  2 waters  Dr Pepper  sprite  and a horchata. All in all it was about  100. We were given number 7. Drinks came out quick minus the sprite. After 20 min or so food started coming out. We got the hot Cheetoh quesadilla and 2 cheese quesadillas. None of the wait staff came by to see if everything was correct. So I walked up to the service window to explain that we got a cheese quesadilla instead of a chicken quesadilla and that we were still missing a sprite and the 2 carne asada dishes. I received the sprite right away. The chicken quesadilla came out 10 min later and still no carne asada dishes. After another 15-20 minutes Again none of the wait staff came by. I went back up to the window to inquire about my missing food. I was told we orders were mixed up and that they would make it right away. I asked for it to go since my kids were already done eating. They brought out the 2 tacos and a mangonada on the house for the wait. Still missing my Texas sized carne asada I asked again. By now we had been there for an hour and a half but I would ve have just left but that Texas sized taco was  20 and I was still hungry. I finally got the food and took it home. When I got home both the tacos and the Texas sized taco had just meat and cheese without the fixings. Overall very disappointed in the food and the service. The best part was the on the house mangonada. Maybe they are still new but figured I would share our experience.
Aparicios,14,Our little one came across a hair in her taco so not the best first experience. For  60 worth of food we lost our appetite after seeing this only a few bites into our dinner and threw away the rest. The s more s milkshake and the pina drink was good but the food wasn t too flavorful. The menu is super creative too but hairnets would be a good investment.
Aparicios,15,First time here and definitely won t be my last. It s a crazy combination of your typical Mexican food truck eats and next gen stuff. For instance  hot Cheetos tacos . Who would ve thought. Old and new. Bold and different. I can t find the words to describe the crazy ideas these people came up with  A ganzito shake   Absolutely insane    If you re an old school Mexican type of eater then you d know just how insane this entire menu sounds. I got the carne asada plate. I m going to be straight up  for  19 it was good but too pricey in my opinion. The meat was definitely cooked great but was very tough to chew in my honest opinion. That was literally the only downside of my entire experience. The hot Cheetos tacos were delicious and very  very different. The salsas were fantastic  the meats were very well seasoned and tasty. I will definitely be back on a cheat day to have all of their shakes in one sitting  just kidding  that s an overload of sugar  Lol . Overall it was definitely great but it would be a 5 star rating if only the fajita was a bit more on the tender side. Other than that  keep up the great work y all  Definitely putting a stamp on changing the game in the Mexican food truck industry 
Aparicios,16,Awesome. Best was anything with the asada. Corn with hot Cheetos was good. Next time will definitely get the Asada machete or the Philly cheesesteak. Would also get the Asada plate. Marzipan milkshake was just OK. Next time will try the s more
Aparicios,17,Every food item here special in their own way nothing like Mexican food with their own twist     My family and I enjoyed it very much  Jenga accessible at every table . Suggest to look at menu before hand since ordering can be high pace   Loved it will be back soon .
Aparicios,18,I was trying to get here for weeks and am glad I finally went  The food was decent but definitely more hype than I was expecting. The machetes are a fun though but a bit greasy and the al pastor wasn t the best I ve had. And the hot Cheeto elote was a strange texture. Overall  I m glad I came here and I d probably come back if I was in the neighborhood but I wouldn t drive 30 minutes again for it.
Aparicios,19,Great Food  I Had the hot Cheeto Tacos and hot Cheeto burrito and my husband had the carnivore machete   Amazing   Flavor was so authentic   If you are a food truck foody  you have to try   
Aparicios,20,great service amazing food recommend if you like tacos that re  5 stars 100   going to continue to come here for sure  
Aparicios,21,I got lured in by their fancy FB posts and was so excited  I was very disappointed  Tables were disgustingly dirty so we took it to go  I ordered the machete w  no avocado sooo I also got no beans  The corn tortilla wasn t cooked all the way and while the meat had good flavor it was really fatty and in huge pieces. Never again
Aparicios,22,Not going back  I don t recommend this place at all  it s overpriced I pay  45 for 2 tacos 1 machete and 2 drinks it s ridiculous. The place has tables but they are really dirty and they have a salsa  bar  but with nothing in it. There are flies everywhere  they need to work on their cleanliness. The food wasn t good either  the meat was hard and not cut  the tortillas where hard  basically if you have kids avoid ordering food for them.
Aparicios,23,Foods greats but they take forever .... I ordered a machete and there was like 5 people before me and it took them a whole hour to make to give me my machete
Aparicios,24,I ordered a salchi-burger with a Mexican Coca Cola it was amazing  I felt like I was in  Monterrey Mexico enjoying the music and food  They also have this new 3 leches shake  I need to try next time
Aparicios,25,Great Mexican food with splash of creativity. They accept cash or credit cards and have a huge menu
Beto's Mexican Restaurant,1,Definitely a mom and Pop spot which I always love in the heart of East Austin it hasn t been gentrified yet. Excellent service great food great drinks pricing is amazing you must eat here. It s just as good as any of the high priced places I had the chicken enchiladas rice and beans were very good. Love their salsa plenty of heat and she kept my chips and salsa full and kept checking on me everybody had a great attitude and I definitely suggest getting the homemade churros 
Beto's Mexican Restaurant,2,The staff are friendly. They have the small town  commubity vibe that I gwt when I visit my paren ts hometown. The food is great too 
Beto's Mexican Restaurant,3,Frankly  this place is walking distance from my house  and I was hungry. I ve been to many of these types of restaurants in Austin  so I didn t expect much. But to my surprise  the food was prepared with a little more love than usual. I had the Steak Poblano  beef skirt steak with grilled onions  bacon  poblano pepper and cheese on top. It s served with rice and beans. It sounds pretty typical  but the beef was cooked perfectly  with just the right amount of caramelization. It was crisp and tender. And the rice wasn t the usual bland  watered down rice. It was spicy and actually had a great flavor  as well as the refried beans. They had a slight hint of bacon and beefy flavor. All in all  I was really glad I popped in. Not the best I ve ever had  but it s definitely on my regular rotation of place s I eat at. Top it all with a Modelo Negra  limon  and you ve got yourself a wonderful meal 
Beto's Mexican Restaurant,4,No frills tex-mex with insanely good homemade salsas  No pretenses with their food  it s simple  filling  and flavorful. Best dish is definitely the al pastor tacos and beef fajita platter. Enchiladas need some work  but you can beat the price overall 
Beto's Mexican Restaurant,5,Had a really bad experienced. They re chips were overly salted. They were super salty. I asked the waitress if maybe they had another bag they could open and she said they had 2 boxes of the same batch and they had to use all of them before they could reorder. Not coming back  Especially with the stupid response from the waitress.
Beto's Mexican Restaurant,6,Straight forward real American Mexicana. Great prices and free chips with delicious salsa.   Superfast in case you are in a rush.
Beto's Mexican Restaurant,7,CHECK YOUR ACCOUNTS  I just had my card swiped for 3 different amounts and when I questioned her about it she completely did not tell me the truth  She took my order wrong  then swiped my card had receipt in her hand  then she corrected the order swiped my card again  and then she s like you owe 4.50  im like No you already swiped my card twice     I will be contacting the management 
Beto's Mexican Restaurant,8,Found this place by accident and was glad that i did.  They have a breakfast taco special before 11am  3 tacos  all the same  2 ingredients  for  3.50    That is a great deal to me  considering my favorite taco is potato and egg.  I get 3 of my favorite tacos for  3.50  I ll take that everyday and twice on Sunday.  I have also tried a couple of their tortas  the torta cubana with milanesa and the torta Mexicana.  The torta cubana was good but a little dry.  Once i added in their green salsa to the torta that was better.  The torta Mexicana was full of meat and is definalty a full meal.  The torta Mexicana has lettuce tomato  sour cream  avocado  breaded  beef  ham  white cheese  chorizo  amp  egg  and a weenie.  I was tryin to eat this in the car and i almost ended up wearing half of it  so if you are going to get the torta Mexicana eat on a flat surface. The torta Mexicana was good but i was thinking when the menu said chorizo and egg i was thinking crumbled chorizo and a fried egg placed in the torta  but the chorizo and egg were mixed like in a taco.  The texture of the eggs and chorizo was throwing me off  my mind was thinking sandwich but i was tasting breakfast taco in my sandwich so the mixture of both was a little off to me.  I ll probably be ordering the quesadilla the next time i go.  I saw one of the waitress taking one to a table the last time i was there and it looked so good  very full of meat and cheese. Try to the breakfast tacos you ll be glad you did.
Beto's Mexican Restaurant,9,Three 2-item breakfast tacos for  3.50  Count me in  Tacos and coffee were  6 total  and were altogether delicious. The bacon was well cooked  and the tacos were filling. I know not to expect anything fancy when I order breakfast tacos  and these met my expectations. They were exactly what I was looking for this morning. The coffee was also pleasantly and surprisingly delicious.  Only thing problem - I asked for corn tortillas and was given flour. Double check your order before leaving.
Beto's Mexican Restaurant,10,Outstanding staff and food to boot. Not sure how we haven t been here as we are so close  geographically. Will be back again and again and again
Beto's Mexican Restaurant,11,I would say you re better off going to Taco Bell. The price point for quality of food did not match at all. We ordered a chicken quesadilla and a chicken burrito with a side of retried beans and 2 margaritas. The quesadilla was of very poor quality. The cheese was not fully melted and there was very little chicken in it. The burrito was of the quality that you would get at a gas station very little meat and too much sour cream. The refried beans were of the consistency of a smoothie. I literally had to add water to my margarita because it was  dry . It was very odd. I definitely wouldn t go back to this with the plethora of other options around. The waitress was very friendly but not attentive.
Beto's Mexican Restaurant,12,Beto s is the most authentic and delicious Mexican food i ve come across in Austin. The chile rellenos are BEYOND WORDS. I m drooling even thinking about them.  The street tacos are also awesome. You can t go wrong with their queso. Everything at Betos is ON POINT.  The staff is friendly and welcoming and very tolerant of my children.
Beto's Mexican Restaurant,13,Love this place. We have been here 2 times in the past 4 days. You can t beat their breakfast taco special. Homemade flour and corn tortillas. Delicious. Kind people who work there too to top it all off 
Beto's Mexican Restaurant,14,Decided to drop in the restaurant while driving by the area during a visit to Austin.  I was not expecting much but ended up absolutely impressed with their breakfast tacos and salsas. So tasty   I went back the next day and had huevos rancheros and was equally impressed 
Beto's Mexican Restaurant,15,Food is ok  not the best we didn t even get chips and salsa when we sat down. It s decently priced for Mexican food in the area not really a place I would say is a must go... but it was just ok
Beto's Mexican Restaurant,16,This location used to be a different Mexican restaurant that I had never eaten at but  I was excited to see that it turned into Beto s.  I have been eating at their other location since before that one was Beto s as well and this location has the same menu but  a larger dining room so you are definitely going to be able to find a seat during peak times.  They also serve breakfast at this location as well.  We ordered our usual queso and I have to say it was better at this location  the salsa was perfect and the chips were fresh.  The chicken monterey was on special and it s one of my favorites but  I decided to try something new that I didn t care for and ended up sending that back and ordering the chicken monterey.  It was just as good as the other location.  This is one of my go to lunch places to get good consistent Mexican food and I am glad they opened a bigger location with better parking.
Beto's Mexican Restaurant,17,Yes  This is some of the tastiest Mexican food I ve had in a long while. Their tortillas are awesome and they have  3 margaritas   I ordered the chili rellano with shrimp and my friend ordered pastor mini tacos  both of which were flavorful and reasonably-priced.  So happy to find this opened up in our neighborhood. This is our New Mexican spot for sure.
Beto's Mexican Restaurant,18, 3 ceviche tostadas.   Authentic Mexican restaurant  good food  inexpensive. The restaurant itself smells like cleaning products  but I suppose that comes with the territory.  And like I said    3 ceviche tostadas
Beto's Mexican Restaurant,19,Servers have always been very courteous and the tacos and burritos are delicious. The bathrooms could use some serious upgrades though.
Beto's Mexican Restaurant,20,It s pretty standard Mexican food and they do a great job with it. They do one or two tex-mex things if you really want  like a  taco salad  in one of those ridiculously huge fried tortilla bowls.  Personally  I love the burritos. Sizable  made like in Mexico. Meat  avo  beans  lettuce  tomato. I really appreciate that since I m lactose intolerant and tex-mex is just swimming in cheeses  creams  and all that.  They have a lot of  plates  too where you get a main and a couple of sides. Big portions. They have a wide selection of tacos as well.  I think they have some drink specials and maybe a karaoke night  Not sure as I generally only go for lunch or early dinner.  The prices are reasonable  the staff is very friendly  and the food is good. Love this place.
Beto's Mexican Restaurant,21,Online menu has prices for every plate  when you go to pick up they charge you more than what s listed. And when u ask them you get an ugly response...
Beto's Mexican Restaurant,22,Everything was fantastic  We had the Fajita Texanas and steak pablano dishes plus Rice  beans   corn tortillas and they were both fabulous  
Beto's Mexican Restaurant,23,I gave this two chances. First time the guisada was meh. Second time the soup was horrible. My dining companion and I didn t finish it nor did I want to take it home. I went across the street and ate after that it was so bad 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,1,I regular this Chipolte. It s usually well kept  and operates efficiently with a friendly staff. The parking lot can be a bit tricky  but there are a couple of reserved pick-up spots you might be able to snag if your lucky. I don t recommend the queso. It s a little grainy and not very delectable. The veggie burrito is a great option if you want guac  but don t want to pay the extra  2. Note  thery still charge extra for guac on a sofritas burrito. The chips are pretty tasty with a salty lime flavor. I wish there were a tip line on credit card receipts here  tips are cash only so bring a buck  I also wish they did a punch card like their local competitor.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,2,I wanted to get some chipotle today  but from my terrible experiences from the past with this location  there is no way  Very slow  usually taking their time doing everything  they are usually out of stuff and they also barely put anything in the bowl
Chipotle Mexican Grill,3,This chipotle is not great. Seems like they usually skimp on scoop size and my bowl is usually watery. I live near here  but have learned to get my chipotle fix from other locations.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,4,This is the WORST place i ve ever been to. I love chipotle and this store sucks ass. I ve lost  30. I ve reported fraud multiple times they are fucking awful.  They don t ever deserve 1 star.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,5,This place is a mess.  Waited more than 30 minutes past pick up time for a to go order along with 20 other people waiting to pick up their orders.  Will not be returning.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,6,Either this chipolte is always out of things or they re just to lazy to cook more. Employees are dismissive and rude. Dont waste your time 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,7,I got the burrito bowl and was stabbed in my gums by a sharp splinter like super pointy material I have no idea what it is from - too scared to finish my bowl super dissatisfied.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,8,This place doesn t have it together at all. Placed order online. I ve been here 45  min waiting for that order to be ready from when they said to expect it  along with 20 other people just trying to get their food and get back to work.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,9,Absolutely do not order here if you re looking to place a simple online order for pick up. You ll be waiting apparently over an hour for your food.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,10,They closed at 9 30 but it says they re open til 10 00 pm. Lazy people . I don t recommend
Chipotle Mexican Grill,11,Online order only  you can t go in  doors are locked and you have to call a number to get your food brought out  and when you call the number you re met with a voice recognition robot and then at the end it says that  pick up isn t available at this location  so how exactly am I supposed to get my food 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,12,This chipotle has really large portions  They remembered everything in our order. We ordered online and our food was delayed by about 5-10 minutes but there were a lot of people waiting too and it was sort of busy for people walking in to order. The middle seating was closed off for covid.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,13,Management does not enforce proper masking by employees. This guy is making a burrito with his nose hanging out.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,14,Did an online order and went to pick up. I get back to work and realize there was an error. No protein    Luckily the manager Holly analyzed the situation quickly and went out of her way to remake it and make the situation right. She even refunded for the inconvenience. Thank you Holly  
Chipotle Mexican Grill,15,This is what I was presented with after opening my burrito bowl.  It was delivered to me.  This is unacceptable. I can t tell if this is a fresh bowl  or a regurgitated one.  And this AFTER I knocked all the tons of sour cream off the side. Smh I ll never go to this location again.  I m on my lunch break at work and have to starve until I get off.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,16,I ve been ordering delivery from this location a lot since COVID.  I appreciate that their delivery fee is only  1 and it is always pretty speedy.  The last few orders I ve received however have been luke warm at best  and today I ordered a bowl that seemed to be about half the size as they normally are.  I ve eaten a lot of chipotle in my life and I always order the same thing -- I know how big it should be   I m disappointed my orders recently have been much lower quality than they used to be.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,17,Ordered delivery on the website from this location and my bowl came with ONLY rice  beans  and meat. No cheese  lettuce  guacamole  salsa  or sour cream  all of which I added to my order when I placed it. So glad I paid  22 for a delivered bowl of bland protein.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,18,The young gentleman who started the burrito line was excellent and offered quick and friendly service. Kudos to him for his stellar work ethic and attitude. The food was fresh  service was friendly  and the bathroom was clean. All in all  it s a standard Chipotle location. Solid overall. Would come back and recommend. There s also plenty of parking.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,19,As we all know  when you go to chipotle  we run the risk of getting the guy that feels it s his destiny to put the least amount of chicken or guacamole as possible. These are the types that seem to be emotionally invested in the chicken and the avocado itself. My bowl was a nice appetizer or maybe if I was a small person or child. If you re over 140 lbs be aware you may leave hungry. And if youre a grown ass average man you ll be going across the street to get a burger.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,20,You would think that following all the horrible press Chipotle has been receiving lately  they would want to try harder to do BETTER. Apparently not...  This is not the first time I have had a less than satisfactory visit to a chipotle restaurant  but I m mostly upset because this location is SO CLOSE to my work and now I don t want to go...   I ordered chips and guac  to take back to work with me. That s it  chips and guac. Easy.  Chips were stale..... and burnt and way too salty  So that was cool...  The guacamole was the worst part- it was old and turning brown  and not just the kind of turning brown that happens when you leave guac out same day    Hardened brown chunks of avacado    At first I thought a piece of chicken made it into the cup  Which would have been equally as gross  in my opinion. But Seriously  I pulled that nasty rubbery brown lump out of my guac and almost threw up to discover the rest of the contents of the cup were just as old.    Yes I want my money back. Yes I want an explanation and an apology.  GROSS    
Chipotle Mexican Grill,21,Standard issue Chipotle that you know  love  and depend on. No surprises  but by going to a Chipotle... do you really want a surprise  The parking is easy and they have the  burrito loading zone  for quick parking if you had enough sense to order ahead to get in and out.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,22,Having sworn off first the Chipotle in Round Rock  La Fronteira   because it sucks   then the Parmer store  because it sucks for different reasons   this location is the next one in my expanding southerly pilgrimage to locate a Chipotle which does not suck.  I fully anticipate having to drive to San Marcos before long.  Until then  this is a consistently good Chipotle  both from food and service standpoint
Chipotle Mexican Grill,23,Right offhand  I can t think of anything clever to say about Chipotle  so let s try this  You just submitted the winning Instagram for the  Boobs  amp  Burrito  contest  and first prize is free burritos for life. You now have to choose between Chipotle  Freebirds  or Cabo Bob s. So which one is it gonna be   See the dilemma here  I think all three are pretty decent  I admire their choices  amp  options  and if you know you re going for soft  amp  mushy goo - Oppan vegan style - it might as well be good  amp  healthy too. Hey  there s Coke Zero at the fountain.   So why am I really going four stars here  Because I was with the delightful Ashley S  who was on fire telling me funny stories. I m gumming away on a Sofritas tofu burrito wondering why Ashley isn t doing open-mic at ColdTowne  because she s that good. Maybe that was the point of this Chipotle experience  to imagine my friends on a different path. And figuring out what to do about it. I m a fan of that.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,24,Meh.  I love chipotle. I really do. Many people do. But here s the deal  I ve been to this location a lot because it was convenient but they re stingy. With everything. Teeny tiny scoop of rice. Small scoop of meat. Maybe two shreds of cheese. Four if you re lucky.  I will now drive myself all the way across town to Brodie lane to that location for their wonderful  fair portions. Much better service.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,25,The best Chipotle that I have been to in a long time. Clean  quality product and friendly staff. It what appears to be the GM or store manager working hard in the back and the staff is attentive and efficient. Other than the bathrooms  men s all I know  needing a little attention  this is a perfect representation of what Chipotle is suppose to be
Chipotle Mexican Grill,26,I ve been to many Chipotles. The burritos  here are HUGE.  Insert  that s what she said  joke here . There was a quick moving line with friendly service.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,27,The employees working there were either extremely rude or just extremely cheap at the servings compared to what I paid for. The lady working at the end of the line with the toppings was slamming my burrito around and glaring at me the whole time I asked for the toppings they offered. It was very uncomfortable and made me never want to go back.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,28,My wife and I came down with food poisoning after eating at this location on 10 9 15.  We both became very ill in the middle of the night within hours of each other.  Given that the only meal we had eaten together in the 24 hrs prior was our Chipotle dinner  it was pretty conclusive what caused it.  She had a carnitas bowl and I had a carnitas burrito.  She was sick for about 36 hrs  I was sick for 4 days.  I reported the incident to both Chipotle HQ and Austin Health and Human Services  but my report was marginalized by both parties.   5 days later food poisoning reports in Oregon start rolling in and a month later 6 states across the country have reports of food poisoning linked to Chipotle restaurants and the same strain of E Coli.  Gee Chipotle  maybe next time you should actually listen to the loyal customer and stockholder when he tells you his family became violently ill after eating at your restaurant.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,29,We know you need to make money  but can you stop with the kids plate sized burritos  I don t usually advertise to the world that I m vegan. But  I do when I come to Chipotle because they re so freaking stingy. 1 4 cup rice  a few sad looking pieces of dilapidated fajita vegetables  a very small amount of corn salsa  brown guacamole  lettuce  and mostly all black beans is what they plop down and my 4 year old would still be hungry. I guess they think most vegans are skinny ___  but I m a Vegan Panda  Since  we re not adding meat  sour cream  cheese  shouldn t we get a little more of what we can eat  Darn it Chipotle  quit letting us starve  Screw it  I ll just take my business to Freebirds 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,30,Absolutely horrible delivery service. If I could give 0 stars I would. I ve spent over  100 in delivery at this location in the past month and in the past 5 times I ve had food delivered  it was late  it was cold and this time it looks half eaten missing. I most likely will NEVER order from here again. Don t waste your time   
Chipotle Mexican Grill,31,Food wasn t very fresh. What type of chipotle doesn t have guac  Very unsatisfied with my lackluster burrito   . I d suggest freebirds down the road.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,32,Come on guys  Chipotle is awesome fast food. It s not a awesome sit down  dinner date place. If you need some quality tacos fast  come here. I don t understand all the negative reviews. The carnitas are always salty and good. The guacamole is always fresh and creamy. I don t frequent this location  but it was damn decent.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,33,Ordered chips and salsa and a burrito bowl. Chips were soooooo stale  and bowl cold. What a shame.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,34,So chipotle is a little expensive when you think about an extra  1.95 for Guac. But the portion of Guac that they give you is amazing. I had the soyfritas in a bowl with rice  lettuce  hot sauce  and guac. I totally forgot the beans though    .. but the portion of food that I got for  9.17 was enough to feed two people. The food is good and it is a nice change up from Freebirds. I am GF and so I can t have the burritos and I wasn t in the mood for nachos lastnight.    The customer service was really nice and the location on the inside was clean too. If I am back in this area  I will for sure stop in      Oh yeah pretty much all bowls start at  6.50 and then Guac  like stated before  is extra. The food looks fresh and I respect the lack of Carnitas until the Pig industry gets their sh t together    
Chipotle Mexican Grill,35,This location has the nicest women working there today ever.  I was able to sample the WONDERFUL Sofritas with brown rice.  DELICIOSO    Can I get an amen for the SOFRITAS   I had not been here in quite a while but this is what I will be ordering.  It is a wonderful meat alternative packed with flavor.  Try it out   This location is AWESOME   Only took off a star due to the parking lot.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,36,This is the only Chipotle location that does not accept call-in orders to-go. The amount of time I was placed on hold  just to be told that they don t accept call-in orders is unacceptable.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,37,My order was messed up and I was given food that had gone bad at a different location. Doug answered my call and immediately offered to remake my food free of cost even though the error happened at a different store. A  customer service and I will definitely be coming back. DOUG IS THE SHIT
Chipotle Mexican Grill,38,Fast customer service.  Good hot food and this place was clean inside out.  I grabbed the hard tacos plate and they were awesome good.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,39,Guys I wouldn t eat here if I were you. I love chipotle. my best friend works here. He told me all the ins and outs. If you eat lunch here expect to be eating the food from the night before. All the salad and the guacamole is being used. Nothing is fresh  This made me sick to my stomach. I can t believe this is happening and still open. I know food has a shelf life. But when you re using guacamole from the day before and it s all black there s a problem. And Chipotle prides itself on fresh food. Ha well I think not. I will not be eating here anymore. Sad thing is the gm don t want to talk about it. Like wow people what are you doing. Don t you know you can kill people 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,40,So the quintessential attribute in a chipotle burrito is the wrap. I ve been here at least 10 times  the first time I got a burrito and they somehow tore the tortilla completely while wrapping it. So subsequent times I d get a burrito bowl with the tortilla on the side  but I can t help but notice their butchering of other s burritoes - it s usually between wrapping the burrito in a cube form  smashing it so that the burrito is never allowed to be elongated or somehow aggressively wrapping their fingers into the filling of the burrito in order to half-ass conjure some kind of shape they think resembles an edible product.  I still go here because it s chipotle and you can t mess up a burrito bowl and tortilla on the side. But the days I want a burrito - those are terrible days.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,41,The burrito shell was a ripped on the corner and they still gave it. And then tried to shove everything in it as it was ripping. I had to ask for extra everything bc they were either barely had any or barely put any. The pico  corn and veggies they just spooned on and didn t let any water drain from the spoon. Not only was the burrito not closed but the foil on top too and they didn t give me a bag  so I left with a half opened burrito. Before I even opened it  it spilled on my shirt. I could not eat it bc it was so soggy and falling apart. It was disgusting. I get the same ingredients and amounts every time so it s not that  it s their utter laziness and lack of care.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,42,Wow  this place is the BEST.  Choosing your own ingredients  happy and helpful service  great decor and delicious food.    I always get the same thing  a bowl  with extra cilantro  and it is delightful every time.   Their guacamole is super fresh and delicious too.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,43,Essentially one of the largest burritos I ve had was right here at this Chipotle. Decent tasting for the price but extra for the guacamole.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,44,Talk about spectacular management  And staff    Tried to call in my order and couldn t  few minutes later manager calls me back ready to take my order apologizing    Talk about customer service and satisfaction    Thank u chipotle  
Chipotle Mexican Grill,45,I m very hungry waiting in line here. They appear to have a large to go order ahead of me  but the employees all have their heads down  meticulously constructing the tacos at a glacial pace. Meanwhile  my wife and I are standing  unacknowledged and hungry. A little communication would go a long way. We ve just finished shopping at the local Sams for bulk snacks  and the last thing we needed was slow service on a Sunday. The lord s day. I believe there needs to be a shift in the store culture. Pride taken in the small interactions  the eye contact  the sense of urgency in accommodating hungry Austinites. I will say  one woman working had a smile on her face  which offered a light reprieve from the otherwise heavily unenthusiastic environment we unfortunately had to occupy. Further  the sloppily thrown together sofritas burrito was unsurprisingly scrumptious. Just what I expect from a well established brand like Chipotle. Silver linings aside  I will not visit this location again  and will instead take my business about 500 yards south to the next nearest location near Mattress Firm.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,46,Good food  same standard . V sloppy service. Girl rushed thru everything   even though there was just one person behind  me . She got most things wrong  and more importantly  did not give me time to even say  double meat . Not my favorite location...
Chipotle Mexican Grill,47,This Anderson Lane Chipotle is a typical Chipotle  fast  friendly  popular  tasty  organic locally-sourced leaning  clean  hip  as healthy as you want it to be  and cheap.  I hate this Chipotle opening here because I live nearby and it s too convenient to drop by and suddenly accumulate 1100 calories from a  5.95 Vegetarian burrito... but that s just my own lack of self-discipline.  Parking is easy and plentiful.  It is the right east neighbor of Cover 3 Sports Bar that s next to the Village shopping center   entertainment complex.  The parking areas are connected so you can easily eat dinner here first before watching a movie at the Village Alamo Drafthouse.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,48,The service was quick and the food  awesome for the reason it earned five-star this is one place in Austin that I will definitely recommend and revisit
Chipotle Mexican Grill,49,This is pure utility food.   When desperation hit and I was short on time and needed some calories  I found myself here. I decided on a bowl. Here s a tip...don t ask them to  go light  on anything. I asked them to go light on the rice and cheese. Regretfully  I wasn t paying attention and ended up with barely a tablespoon of rice and a light sprinkle of cheese. My sad looking container looked pathetic and half empty. Complete with a drink  my meal rang in at over  10. Hardly worth the money.  The flavor was...wait  there was none. It had no flavor. Luckily  they have bottles of Tobasco sauce handy  so I was able to drown it in hot sauce and at the very least trick my taste buds into thinking I was eating real food.  I can t honestly say I won t be back  as it s convenient in times of desperation...and I m sure I ll find myself here when I m in a bind.   That ll teach me to leave my lunch at home...
Chipotle Mexican Grill,50,Okay  so in general I am not a fan of national chains.  In fact  I d usually choose a Mom  amp  Pop shop over even a regional chain in most cases.  But the new Chipotle Mexican Grill at The Village is definitely an exception for me.    Because I have two friends who are  for whatever reason  completely addicted to Chipotle dining  I have frequented many of the stores in the Austin area.    I have to say... the new Village Location is a cut above the rest.  The managers  who I now know by name as they do me  are great and extremely attentive and dedicated to customer service.  Yes  it s just a burrito...  or tacos  or a salad  a bowl  or whatever .  But the Village Chipotle folks make the experience a good one.  It s no wonder we frequent that location the most now     And yes... the guac ROCKS   I have never experienced anything other than generous portions.  So I ll be back... over and over again  I m sure. Even if my waistline suffers somewhat because of it.  But hey... I know the Weight Watchers point values for just about everything on the menu at this point. Go figure.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,51,Since I work in the Village and am extreeemely lazy  I probably eat at this Chipotle about three times a week  sometimes more .  The ingredients are great  the steak is medium rare -- mwah    the service is usually quick  and the employees are always super friendly.  Chuck must be  like  the greatest manager in the world  because this Chipotle has better employee retention than most of the companies my friends work for.  It s clear that his employees take so much care and pride in what they do here  which seems like a silly thing to say about a fast food burrito place  but it really does not go unnoticed in my book.  Today was my buddy s birthday  and I wanted to treat him to lunch.   Don t worry -- he likes Chipotle as much as I do.   Candyce was her usual bubbly self  wished my friend a happy birthday  and made sure that his burrito bowl was on the house.  Thanks  Candyce   It was about time I updated this to a five-star review 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,52,Always a fan and food is good. I always get the bowl which is filling. Great place to go to.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,53,Angel made our fave experience even better. Thank you for the great customer service tonight  along with the rest of the night crew  All extra fresh ingredients.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,54,With a huge crowd of people waiting for them to open well after their opening time the employees ignore everyone and keep doing whatever they are working on.  I got sick of waiting after 20 minutes and found somewhere else to spend my lunch money as did many others.  Probably won t be back to this one.  At least let people know what s going on.  They even ignored my knocking on the door.  Bye.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,55,Man  this used to be my favorite spot near my place  but recently they have had a lot of turnover. Things just haven t been the same. I ve been told the location near campus is now the best one in Austin.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,56,LOVE CHIPOTLE   New addition to the family right next door to Cover 3   Nice setup with a friendly staff.  What better place to get you Burrito Bowl Fix ON   I work near here and like what Chipotle can offer with the fast  friendly  service   Thanks guys for a great first impression...we will be back to order more food     By the way  they make the Guac fresh daily  D
Chipotle Mexican Grill,57,Not much to review about Chipotle. Is anyone really checking Yelp reviews to decide whether to go   I can say it s probably the only fast food I ll eat. It s tasty  and I can feel good about it. I m always grateful I can grab something that won t kill me in a hurry  but always pissed I still have to pay  9 for only lettuce  meat  gauc and salsa.   This Chipotle always seems  new.  It s very clean  the ceilings seem higher  there is a lot of glass....the couple times I ve gone there weren t that many people there.   That s all I have to say about that  -Forrest Gump.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,58,I m not the biggest fan of burrito s bigger than my stomach  but I was once again  dragged by a friend.  The place was really clean. Surgeries could probably be performed on the tables which looked like steel. We didn t know exactly what we wanted but the staff was still friendly  another plus.  When we got our gigantic burrito  I was happy to see that it was way better than Freebirds. All the ingredients tasted fresh and the rice  well  I could have just had a bowl of plain rice and be happy.   I can see myself coming back here  especially if someone recommends Freebirds. I can t stand that place...
Chipotle Mexican Grill,59,It s Chipotle  which is good  but I ll keep this one simple   Me  coming in 10 minutes to close  having placed an online order   Hey  I m here to pick up my online to-go order.   Them  Hi  Are you ____   Me  Yeah  hey  I m ______.   Steven  interrupting Them   Oh man. Hey  _____. Look - we re out of guacamole.   Me  That s cool man  no guac. Not a huge deal.   Steven  It IS a huge deal to me - it s my job to make sure we have what you order  and this is my bad.   Me  Really  that s nice of you  but it s fine - you guys are great  there s no problem.   Steven  I insist you take this card for FIVE FREE MEALS here.   Me  Okay  yeah. Thank you - this is crazy. I ll be back.   Can t argue with people who care...
Chipotle Mexican Grill,60,Best service ever. Me and my husband were there today for the first time and they were great  thoughtful and nice. I will be back a thousand times   
Chipotle Mexican Grill,61,I don t frequent Chipotle regularly  and it was my first time at this location. But I assumed a Carnitas burrito had  well Carnitas. I led with that  not really paying attention to the type of pork she put on  shredded  until I saw that it was not what the picture looked like. After arguing with me that I said  pork  I had to point out that carnitas is also pork. So maybe that is something training can go over  don t know  be more specific with the questions to customers  Or maybe just put carnitas on when they order a carnitas burrito and don t ask  Not sure which is better....Anyway  she does it over in silence. I apologizes to her  mentioning that I don t go there often  and get no response. She definitely heard me. When I get to sauces she puts the wrong sauce on...at this point I don t want to make her do it over a third time  so I just bite my lip. Apparently all this was noticed by the guy who checked me out  the manager   who without me even saying anything said  its on us.  I thanked him and left. That at least shows that there is hope for improvement and that this location isn t indifferent to its customers.  I ll come back  but not a good first impression.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,62,Great food  love the service  many gluten free options  sometimes they undercook the rice but I can live with that... but why did they have to go and attack the 2nd amendment by banning lawful concealed carry citizens and start putting communist socialist sayings on their to go bags. If they want American dollars respect our constitution   Quote from George Saunders on their bag     Hope that  in future  all is well  everyone eats free  no one must work  all just sit around feeling love for one another.   Say what  Obama should have used that as his presidential running slogan 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,63,I love chipotle  I try to avoid this one if I can because they are the worst with the portions. I have to get double meat just to get a reasonable amount. The server actually scooped one cube of chicken out thinking she put too much in there. All in all it was a weak first scoop and about a 1 3 of a scoop on the second if I can be specific. I  like extra cheese and they sprinkle it on like Salt Bae. It s like pulling teeth to get a reasonable meal. They are usually in good spirits though 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,64,So you either like their food or not. I have been here multiple times. The pork was a bit dry and I would not eat the beef. The veggies and the chicken I definitely liked and would recommend. There is outdoor seating and the service has always been fast. If you are in a rush send in an internet order.   Speaking of which  I ordered last night and it did not come through their system. That s bad. To make up for it the manager immediately takes my order and makes it on the spot. She also throws in some free chips an guac. That makes up for it in my book. At least she admitted it was a mistake and wanted to make up for it.   They also have the option to double up on the meat. Might cost you more but they have it.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,65,This place is miserable. I have been there maybe 15 times  and they have yet figured out how to wrap a burrito. If it s not the burrito wrap  it s that their tortillas stick together in the bag  thus the tortilla tears when you pull them apart. Since they can t figure out how to wrap a burrito  I have also tried their bowls. Everything else tastes great  yet the somehow found a way to mess up the vinaigrette. Instead of flowing like most vinaigrette s do  it was like a glob of flubber  yes  the same flubber as the Robin Williams movie  disgusting . The staff seems fine  and it seems to be a managerial problem. Instead of going here  go to the one off of Metric and Parmer  Just a little bit further but the experience will be so much better 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,66,Not sure what has been going on at this place....maybe some different management     THE SERVICE IS OFF THE HOOK WONDERFUL  The food is good and what you expect from Chipotle....but I will keep going back to this location because it is run right  The employees seem happy and eager to wait on you. Everyone greets you when you come in and you just get a good vibe. I avoided this location because I had a negative experience awhile back   but now it s completely different. Whatever you are doing keep it up management  GREAT JOB 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,67,It wasn t anything special  The burrito was ok  didn t have a big choice selection. It looked like stripped down version of freebirds.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,68,Definitely good food. I sadly don t have one close enough at home so this is a nice treat when traveling. The location is clean and good service. Great food too
Chipotle Mexican Grill,69,This review is less about Chipotle as a whole and more about this specific shop.  You either like the food or don t.  Personally I m a fan.  The restaurant is always clean  and the associates are friendly and keep the line moving.  The manager must be doing a good job because everyone seems happy to be here and I ve never had a negative experience.  Only Cabo Bobs is as good as this Chipotle   Nice job guys  keep it up 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,70,I hate burritos with a passion. They are ridiculously big and there is just too much rice and too many beans and not enough flavor. Yet  I love Chipotle s burritos and burrito bowls. No matter the overwhelming number of ingredients I get them to shove into a burrito  they wrap it up perfectly. They make it quick and easy to order. They are still huge  but the other half is delicious the next day. The burrito bowls are enough for three meals  which is such a steal. Having access to healthy  if you order right   natural ingredients in a fast-food place amazes me.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,71,I write this review out of spite.  I know that there is no small business owner whose feelings I can bruise  no Mr. Chipotle who ll text me  begging me to rescind my harsh feelings.  So I feel free to unload.  MY FEELINGS ABOUT THE VILLAGE CHIPOTLE  1  It s taken months  but they re finally getting the idea of what an adequate portion of meat is supposed to be.  Did you see the sad look in my eyes  miss   Did you then see the small lump of barbacoa sitting in the tortilla   CAUSATION CORRELATION  2  Did they just stop constructing it   Seriously  they opened before they were done with the walls  and now I m beginning to think that there are parts of the inside that are intentionally being left undone.  Maybe I m overrating it and it s been done for months and I just never noticed.  I DON T ALWAYS NOTICE THINGS  3  This is a system wide thing  but it especially counts here-- why am I paying you  1.50 for a little pat of guacamole   Hell  I M NOT EVEN THE ONE PAYING YOU  I m just picking it up for my coworker.  I don t LIKE guacamole   But you insist on charging for it  bringing his burrito up to  8ish   WHY    Moreover  why did you tease me several times by not charging for the guac   You know you can do it  YOU KNOW YOU CAN SO JUST DO IT I AM NICE AGGGGGH.  But don t worry  I get my passive aggressive revenge every time my coworker gets charged for the guac by filling my water cup with Coke.  HAH   4  God  the parking situation out there sucks.  Why does Obee s get so many spaces   5  I like burritos.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,72,I used to work at Austin Catering  in the same building complex as this Chipotle  so I ate here.....ummmm.....every single day.  The food was always good  but it was this Chipotle that made me stop ordering the guac.  EVERY SINGLE DAY it was BROWN    I would go in at 11 am  right at opening time  and the guac would just look gross and slimey.  The people that work there were pretty annoying to me.  The main guy that usually started your order was always very hyper and in a hurry.  He would throw rice in my bowl  sling the beans all over the side  and slide my bowl down to the other person.  It would piss me off every time  cuz at 11 am  I was usually the only person there   Slow the hell down  and stop making a mess with my food  The manager was pretty friendly  but in a fake douchey way.  There were like 3 really nice girls there though that counteracted the douchey-ness of the guys.  Also  this place got STUPID PACKED at lunch time.  Line out the door  nowhere to sit  stupid.  Also  the way they have the seating arranged is not really helpful in that situation.  They have like 5 or 6 long bars  and people usually don t want to sit next to or across from strangers while they eat.  When I ve gone in there and seen that the only seats were at the bars  I ve gotten my order to go.  And without the option of the stools  there is only like 5 or 6 normal tables  plus outdoor seating.   It was great when I was working just a few doors down  but I would not voluntarily go here on my days off......just not that great.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,73,I waited a few months to review this Chipotle  enough time for them to iron out the kinks.  In this area of Austin you really can t beat the convenience  price  and quality that Chipotle provides.  For a while I tried to switch over to the burrito bowl  but being the fat dude that I am came running back to the burrito proper.  Just a word to the wise  the veggie burrito with the works is almost 900 calories...I don t even want to know what it is if you add meat in.  In the short time that this Chipotle has been open I have won burritos for four twice.  I love this location.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,74,this particular chipotle location is the twilight zone.  if you are GLUTEN FREE  do NOT frequent this location.  they are very rude and I have even been mocked for asking them to change gloves so as not to contaminate my food with gluten.  chipotles are usually really good about accommodating dietary restrictions safely  but this one does not.  it sucks.  the food has seemed below par here too lately  but the service has been bad enough alone to never return.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,75,Not great but not bad tex mex if in a hurry.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,76,I am probably Chipotle s best customer. Not just at this location  but at all locations across Austin. They should probably hire me as a quality assurance tester. If anyone eats at Chipotle more than me  they probably have mental issues. The main reason I love Chipotle is because of the way that they season their meats. From the chicken to the barbacoa  its all delicious. Surprisingly  they also serve up a solid margarita. Fairly strong too.   
Chipotle Mexican Grill,77,Nice clean place. Seating arrangements are awesome. Food is healthy. Customer service is fantastic. What else you need.   
Chipotle Mexican Grill,78,Fresh Guac at anytime you arrive   Quick and good chicken. What else to say.....it is chipotle.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,79,Quick  efficient and I can get a nice amount of protein with some hot salsa. But other than that  it costs me as much as a sit down place and I have that regretful taste in my stomach afterwards  kind of like after eating fast food.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,80,Legit.  Burritos with everything you could possibly want or need.  Great quality  great variety  and affordable prices.  The staff is always authentically Austin  even though its a chain .  The best thing to do is to get the monster size and save the other half for another meal.  It just makes sense.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,81,Good afternoon.  Today my boyfriend and I went to the location above for lunch.  Normally  we go to the location downtown on Congress Ave. and always get good service there.  Today at the above location  not so much.  We both ordered salads and we got very little lettuce  cheese and meat  basically  very little of everything .  We both added guacamole and received about 2 tablespoons and when we asked for a litlle more the lady gave us attitude and said she would have to charge for a double serving.  I don t mind paying the  2 extra for the guacamole because I like it and order it everytime but I would like to taste it.  For  2 I can buy 4 avocados and make a big bowl of guacamole.  Again  I don t mind paying for it because I am a loyal customer but I would like to get what I pay for.  Normally  I don t complain but this is the second time we have left this location still hungry.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,82,Where is my Chipotle from Northern VA      I realize I m in Austin  the tex-me mex capital of the country  but still I expect CONSISTENCY with Chipotle. I LOVED me some chipotle when I lived in VA  must have gone to at least 8 different branches  as I worked from the road a lot. But this Austin store sold short of what I got back home. In context  this store needs to STEP IT UP  Every component was just  off.  Gone was the  wow  factor  and the portions flavors just did not deliver the  O  factor for me. Still a pass though.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,83,I went to this Chipotle instead of the one at 183 and MoPac but was disappointed. I hadn t had Chipotle in months and was really craving it but my burrito was really salty. Almost to the point that it was not edible. My boyfriend s was the same way. We think it was the chicken that was the problem. Next time I ll try the 183 and MoPac location.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,84,very quick  never too crowded. Unfortunately I often go somewhere else because I circle forever looking for a place to park. Bummer 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,85,I don t like this locations....  The staff here is rude and gave me weird looks when I asked for a burrito with just Beans and Rice and unlike all the other chipotle locations charged me for a vegetarian burrito instead of two sides... Seriously If i wanted to pay 7 bucks for beans and rice well... anyways you wont find me going to this location ever... I was livid.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,86,This location has over-the-top great service.  I live in the neighborhood  so I go regularly because the food is great  the restaurant is clean  and the service is so friendly and attentive.  I also recently tried out their catering service for a teacher appreciation luncheon at my kids  school and it was even better than I expected.  The set-up was easy and the food was as good as in the restaurant.  Hooray for General Manager Chuck and his great crew 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,87,Two doors down from the dreaded -  amp  dreadful - Shabu  See my review of 8 - 6 -14  is Chipotle. If you want a deal  amp  not an ordeal  check it out. My husband  amp  I decided to give it a try after watching a documentary about it on Netflix.  Yes - a whole doc  not a commercial.  This is the way a business should be run. Good quality  locally sourced ingredients  amp  an option to  have it your way   but Chipotle is no Burger King. I was after a Paleo-friendly meal - low starch. Figure the odds in a Tex-Mex place  But despite the fact that we walked in during the peak of the lunch hour  the manager took the time to explain the best way to get what I was after  Opt for the Burrito Bowl w out the corn  beans or rice. In addition  he brought me a sample of each of the 4 meats they offer on the line. As it turned out I got the Veggie Bowl  bc the guac looked so good  -  amp  it WAS  -  amp  came w  the Veggie. It s a paid-for extra on the meat versions.  Next time I get the BB w  chicken.  We were very satisfied w  our lunch  amp  we each ate for under  7  In addition  all the line servers were courteous  amp  looked happy to be there. In the end I went home w  a card that gave a complete nutritional profile of every menu item  amp  another card for people w  food allergies  amp  gluten sensitivity. One word of caution. If you want ambiance  go someplace else  bc Chipotle just isn t that kind of restaurant  but it fills my criteria  Good  cheap  fast  amp  a lot. Ya can t beat that.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,1,My to go restaurant if I cannot pick a restaurant. The quality stays the same. I .have had like two bad experiences out of the hundreds of times I have gone. This location has a lot of sitting areas and is pet-friendly  and it is usually not that full.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,2,tl dr - don t order online  I ordered on their app for pickup on Monday at 5 40 pm to avoid waiting in line. I got there at 5 55 pm  thinking I d give them a little extra wiggle room  and they still didn t have my order ready. The app said my order would be ready on the pickup shelves  but their pickup shelves were empty  all the orders were sitting unorganized at the front. It probably would ve been faster for me to just wait in line. There were about 6 other people waiting for online orders as well. I didn t get my food until 6 05 pm. The disappointment continued when I saw the size of my burrito. It looked so much smaller than what I m used to getting from Chipotle. Because of this  I don t recommend ordering online here. The food is good  but better to wait in line and watch as they make your order to ensure you re not getting ripped off.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,3,Not enough people working. No customer service. The person who rang me up looked miserable and hates her job. Unfortunately this is the times were living with where millennials do not want to work.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,4,I usually go to this location without any issues but placed a pick up order via the Chipotle app. When I got home and opened the bag  the burrito seemed 1 3 of the usual size. Mostly tortilla and barely any filling.  Look at the photos for reference. Barely my fist size.   Someone needs to QA these before they re sent out. This is just sad.   I made another meal after this since this did not fill me.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,5,I placed an order for a specific pick up time since I only have a 30 minute lunch. Was the wrong order. Not a big deal. But then instead of fixing my order they continued to make other pick up orders as I stood there and waited. Now I asked for a refund instead since I m not even going to have time to eat. Which can apparently only be done over the phone. Spoke to the manger no apology. Didn t seem to care and I ended up being late back to work and didn t get to eat.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,6,It s 4pm on Sunday  store doesn t close till 10pm  and the first line guy said they are out of black beans  steak  and they were out of corn salsa. I understand if you are short staffed and having a hard time. Completely understand it s not the employees fault  but he was so deliberately rude and unaccommodating to everyone. You re out of every other item for the next 6 hours 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,7,Slow as molasses. Terrible customer service. Literally add 30 minutes to your online order time because it will not be ready.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,8,Slow  2pm  they have 1 person working at the counter. It takes 30 minutes to get through the line.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,9,10 10 very neat and organized. Michael had great customer service. They were quick and neat with my food. Fresh and quality food 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,10,one of the worst customer service experiences out of any chipotles  the server Elisabeth I believe  was super rude  short with my order and very defensive when I asked her to serve me the correct portion amount as I have literally a 1000 times before  the manager had to step in to correct her  then as I turn away to pay for the order  she purposely pours an overfilled scoop of sour cream  drenching the entire tortilla  foil and counter top  digging all ten fingers into my burrito fumbling the content that was now completely unwrappable due to not applying common sense. This was rude and inappropriate  I canceled my order and requested a refund  but still can t believe how the employee reacted when I simply asked to receive the correct portion amount. Obviously not a big deal but would not visit this location again.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,11,The food has always been good. But this location specifically gives the absolute smallest bowls. It s been a consistent problem especially for the price.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,12,This is by far my favorite location the past few times I ve gone to chipotle. The worlds friendliest staff. Make for such a good experience that you don t even realize you needed after a long day. I hope the managers really appreciate their employees and recognize the solid crew at this location.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,13,Y all. I love Chipotle. I ve gone to this location multiple times and not been dissatisfied. But I ordered delivery from their website and it was the worst. Everything was gross  the rice was clumped like it s been sitting for too long in water without stirring.  In our order we asked for specific things  and even contacted the store to make sure it was in our order. They messed up almost everything and forgot items that was ordered through the website. The driver spent 20 minutes at another location  with our food just sitting in the car  and showed up almost an hour later after it was picked up.  All our food was sideways in the bag  the chips were a joke  almost burnt.  In all honesty  just go in and make sure what you re getting what you want  don t rely on them making their delivery orders correct.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,14,So I ordered lunch via the app. Requested a full portion of chicken and full portion of steak with brown rice  black beans  fajita veggies  quac  sour cream  cheese  corn salsa and lettuce. This should ve made one hell of a burrito bowl. What I got was 5 grains of rice  10 beans  10 strips of lettuce  12 kernels of corn  half the meat  a few shreds of cheese  little guac and a little sour cream. It all fit in the bowl with room to spare.  This is a total croc of shit for what I paid   I will never again order from this hole.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,15,I appreciate Chipotle being open  but I m super disappointed with my online order. I ordered two burritos and chips and salsa and I was super excited to eat it. Got home and opened it up and there was literally a huge tear in the middle of my burrito. How can you not see this when wrapping the burrito  It s super hard to miss. I would have been cool if they included a tortilla on the side. But I didn t get anything  just a torn and messy  burrito  my husband did not enjoy his chicken burrito. He had maybe 4 pieces of chicken in his chicken burrito. Food was cold and not very flavorful. Will not be going back to this location again.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,16,I eat at Chipotle pretty regularly and typically you get what you expect - a decent burrito or bowl  chip quality definitely is hit or miss  crispy and slightly tangy or stale and bland with giant wads of salt scattered around . The food can be tasty  fresh  and hot if you stop in at the right time and for what you pay I think you get your money s worth.  Unfortunately  my bowl earlier this week gave me some of the worst food poisoning I have ever experienced in my life  salmonella based on my symptoms . I don t know if I should be surprised - I ve seen important food prep hygiene go out the window at this location when they re busy - whether it s smearing random burrito ingredients all over the prep surface then into whichever tub is close by or onto the floor  gloves touching a bunch of different surfaces  cross-contamination here and there  the team needs some retraining. In any case  my trip earlier this week left me violently ill. I ll spare the details on what that precipitated out of my body  but I ve lost a few pounds and am retaining food for the first time in about 4 days. Thanks Chipotle - I ll be taking a break from the chain and this location for a good bit.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,17,The service was good but the food was too salty. I buy from there all the time and usually I don t have any issues
Chipotle Mexican Grill,18,Tried the new carne asado bowl  the meat was flavorful. The place was clean and busy upon opening. Customer service is up to par  they recognize their regulars.  Veterans Day deal  buy one get one free for military service members  veterans and military spouses.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,19,I mean  do I even need to say anything  Everyone knows this place is amazing. So quick  easy  and it always delivers on flavor.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,20,All the good things   Super close to my office so I come here often. Their staff is so nice  customer service is on point at this location. Their meat selections are always fresh  and the guac is always good .. unlike some other locations where their guacamole has that funky smell and taste  its always very tasty here.   I just went in to get some lunch for myself and my coworker  and I had tried to play their online game earlier to get a BOGO offer  but for some reason I never actually received the text offer  but they honored it anyway  Yay  
Chipotle Mexican Grill,21,I love that it s nestled in the corner of a shooping center. It s Saturday evening and it s not crowded at all. Friendly and fast service. Not to mention FROZEN MARGARITAS  which I ve never seen at any chipotle ever  Thoroughly impressed. Huge scoop of chicken. Belly happy.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,22,I order from here all the time and it s usually good. The chicken usually has some weird tasting parts in it sometimes. Other than that it s good.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,23,Messy burrito that s unevenly stuffed and rolled. Struggling to bite it without losing half of it every time. Gritty barely warm queso. Chipotle is gross. Go to Freebirds.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,24,So I came here with my girlfriend who is a veteran to do the bogo deal they have for Veterans Day. HUGE MISTAKE. They overcharged us twice and they charged me for queso and they didn t even do a quarter of a spoon. They charged my friend for guacamole and he didn t even ask for any or get any. The lady at the back was super rude and rolled her eyes when I asked her for extra cheese after she had put less than they normally do on. The cashier was incompetent and blamed the machine for overcharging us and refused to work with us. Chipotle is expensive and this was a completely unsatisfying experience
Chipotle Mexican Grill,25,Worst  11 I ve spent in awhile. Ordered meal was nothing like advertised on the app. Will not be ordering from this location again.  Online order via chipotle app 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,26,Gotta love chipotle    The workers were very nice  they served good portion sizes and everything was very clean.  Bunches of tabasco sauces so that was awesome.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,27,This Chipotle never disappoints. Ingredients are fresh  never had a problem. They are consistent and service is quick great. Some Chipotle locations in Austin tend to skimp on portion  especially with burrito and bowls. This one does not. Come here 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,28,This place is one of many franchise locations so my review is more about the service and friendliness of the staff. The food was good as always and now they have gone  Non-GMO  for those of you who are into all the small print stuff. There was a HUGE line in front of me at lunch time on a rainy day and I got to order my food and get put of this place within the next 10 minutes. I could have sworn there were at least 17 people in front of me so I would have to say that this place really knows what they re doing as far as staffing and they are also very friendly and welcoming.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,29,I ve been meaning to write this review for over a week but I m just getting around to it.  I have to say the Manager at this location is an outstanding example of First Class customer service.  I m vegetarian and went in one evening and they had run out of the tofu based option and guacamole.  I was so hungry and had been craving Chipotle but was sad when I was going to have a basic bowl with no sofritas or guacamole    however the Manager saved the day and started making me fresh sofritas.  I had to wait and he even made me a fresh bowl after. He went above and beyond and I will continue coming to this Chipotle always.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,30,Every time I come to this chipotle I leave in a better mood. They are so nice and treat customers like their friend. The management is doing something right here.   I normally have my wallet on me and if I don t I always have emergency cash at the bottom of my purse. Well on this specific day I didn t. I was with a friend and told her I would transfer her the money so she could pay for my meal  but the cashier said it was on the house. What an awesome gesture.   Since that day anytime I go to Chipotle  I go to this location. On another occasion I ve had someone give me a drink because the lines were really long.   Thanks for being so nice every time I come 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,31,I love Chipotle. If there was one closer to my apartment then I would be in serious trouble. I m a creature of habit and get the same thing every single time. Burrito bowl  brown rice  no beans  ick    chicken  mild salsa  sour cream  lettuce  cheese  amp  a bag of chips to eat my bowl with. The price has gone up over the years but it s still delicious so I keep coming back. Great customer service at this location. They re always quick and efficient. If you dress in costume on Halloween you get half off your burrito  and I recommend playing all the Chipotle games and entering the contests because they give out a lot of buy one get one free coupons.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,32,I can tell this location is buying low quality ingredients and I m really dissatisfied. I don t want to speculate about why they cut back  but the low quality chicken  lettuce  and beans were very obvious to detect by texture  color  and flavor.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,33,I am dissatisfied because the quality of my food and the service I received. My rice was bland with no flavor I could tell the rice was old because the cilantro was no longer green. My chicken had no flavor it tasted like unseasoned chicken. The employees were as medicore as the food. As I walked in they were using drink cups to build a pyramid  and they put them back when we started walking up to the line. That s unsanitary as well as them not washing there hands. They also ate lemons on the line. This was about 6 24 when they began to eat the limes.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,34,This was my first Chipotle experience and it wasn t that great. Definitely not something I would buy again unless there were no other options. I did like that there were frozen margaritas. Otherwise  the food was nothing to phone home about.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,35,I go here so often. I LOOOOVEEEEE CHIPOTLEEEE. CHIPOTLE IS MY LIFFFFFFEEEEE That little kid vine is 100  accurate.   a href   redir url https 3A 2F 2Fwww.youtube.com 2Fwatch 3Fv 3De56MuzEGZm4 amp s 9f2642a7d8fa0df127698f05ad921b48de4851e1d849fb719e183d26c5a562aa  rel  nofollow  target  _blank  youtube.com watch v e56M   a    I wish the chiptopia would last longer though.   Friendly stafff  quick service  and tastey food. What else can I ask for 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,36,Valentine saved the day. We were the turds that came in right before closing. He hooked it up with fabulous service and a smile... even though we were turds. Been back since d he is still awesome. Always have a tummy ache the next day but worth it.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,37,Chipotle Employee here tried to not fully honor corporate coupon.  Chipotle recently sent out a mass coupon mailing  including the following coupons   One free Burrito  Burrito Bowl  or Order of Tacos  One free Chip  amp  Salsa with any order  cannot combine coupons of course.    There is no written limit on the coupons therefore corporate did not intend for there to be a limit  meaning  if you want 6 orders of meat in a bowl  it s included in the coupon.  When sending mass coupons  companies impose limits if they believe they will need limits  these coupons are thought out and every word is intentional  they are also programmed into Chipotle s checkout system with the specific code on the coupon  so if there were a limit  the coupon would not only say it  it would show up in the system.  My apartment complex had a mass mailing of these coupons and my friends gave me theirs if they were not interested in going  so I have used a couple before this coupon and have not had any issue getting 3-4 servings of meat and guac before.   The employee said  people are abusing these coupons  there s a limit of two meats and the other meats will be sides and you ll have to pay for them.  I informed her that she s incorrect and that the coupon has worked for more than 2 meats before  I explained that a side order would not be included in the bowl  it would have to be outside the bowl to be considered a side  since the bowl contained all of the meats it is not in any way a side order.  The manager  I believe   came over and corrected the employee promptly  though it seemed that the manager instructed the employee to do this and only corrected it because I was complaining.   I don t think Chipotle s corporate HQ would appreciate not honoring their coupons  especially considering it s a PR campaign to bring people back to Chipotle after having multiple foodborne illnesses.   I also don t understand the logic  as this is not a franchise- the individual stores are not directly affected by having extra meats in a bowl.  The employees have no reason or right contention regarding Chipotle s coupons  it makes no sense.  Get a grip  Chipotle.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,38,I admit i was little afraid on eating at this place with the health scare but this place was good  we got the bowl and it was really good the staff was nice the only thing the tortillas were chewy  the inside of the restaurant was nice and the menu board was easy to read   and the prices are reasonable  they do sell Margaritas - served from  a machine and they do have beer as well  we will be back
Chipotle Mexican Grill,39,If I could give negative  stars I would my pregnant  girlfriend  wanted chipotle  so bad and literally there was hardly any rice in her bowl and the chicken  was gummy  for some reason not only that she found a bone in the chicken definitely  will not ever be going back so upset about our experience
Chipotle Mexican Grill,40,Not sure what s wrong with people who reviewed this location earlier. I saw one review complain about a lack of queso and a  meal  option    Anyways  I eat here about once a week and never have any complaints. If you have had Chipotle before you know what to expect. This location is one of the best and I have no reservations about recommending this one. The food is high quality  tastes great  and is priced right. I love the steak and always get that or half and half with chicken. The guacamole is the best I ve had anywhere and is a must have.   The staff here is always very friendly and never skimp out in portions. Newsflash for the people complaining about some of the staff not portioning out enough food  you have a mouth. If you want some more just ask and they ll happily oblige.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,41,This is the one Chipotle place I come to regularly  as the service and food quality is consistent and tasty. Thanks for keeping me on my Chipotle chicken burrito bowl addiction 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,42,I have been a longtime fan of Chipotle. Having grown up in the Northern CO area where it originated  I ve been going there for nearly 2 decades. It is my  comfort food  and the place I go when I m sick and nothing else sounds good.   Which brings us to why I m writing this review. Earlier this week I stumbled into this Chipotle after having just been released from the hospital  ie  I was sick and wanted my favorite comfort food . I was totally out of it  but I always order the same thing so even though I was mumbling  they got the idea and fixed me up my perfect burrito. The woman who was driving me home from the hospital had never been to a Chipotle and I was too sick to give recommendations  so despite a line  the guys  amp  gals behind the counter patiently helped her figure out what she wanted. Basically  the two of us held up the whole line  were less-than-ideal customers  and I wasn t even conscious enough to be more than a little bit polite. We got to the register and I m fumbling with money  when the person there just said  it s on us today.    It took a few moments for that to sink in and and when it did I could have just melted with relief. On a day when everything had gone wrong  a couple of people at a Chipotle took the time to notice and be kind. It meant a lot.  I have always been a loyal Chipotle customer  and it s not just because the food is amazing. It s because of moments like these. Time after time I ve seen the employees reach out and do nice things for others. This time  I just happened to be on the receiving end of it and I couldn t be more grateful. So thanks  Chipotle  for making my bad day so much better.   PS- my friend absolutely loved the burrito bowl they helped her pick out and I m quite sure you ve earned yourselves yet another loyal customer   
Chipotle Mexican Grill,43,Let me say this 1st  I love Chipotle  I could eat it everyday     ....but not here.  They were cheap on their portions  amp  the girl with the hat  amp  the piercings was very rude and did not even say thank you.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,44,I guess Chipotle will do in a pinch. The service is fast and the food is fine.  It s not like this is anyone s favorite restaurant or anything. It s a place you go to get sustenance when you need it quickly.  So if you think to yourself   I am hungry and I want something quick and moderately healthy and I don t want to think about it very hard  that  s probably a good time to go stuff your gaping mouthhole with some all-natural  organic  cage-free  gluten-free  buzzword  buzzword  biodegradable  buzzword  Chipotle food stuffs.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,45,I used to avoid this store due to the incompetent manager  but since they ve removed him the store has improved. As much as I appreciate the speed of the employees  being asked if this is for here or to go 8 times from the beginning of the line to the cashier is a bit of an annoyance.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,46,My husband and I stopped by this store tonight after our long drive from San Diego  CA. We were greeted by such a friendly guy and we began talking to 3 employees about things to see while we were visiting. It was such a refreshing trip for food after traveling. Of course the food was great as a bonus to the great people working there  Two thumbs up from us.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,47,Best and easy access to healthy food  Worth the money and this branch in particular is always crowded. It is kept clean and good service. Although they should incorporate free wifi into there branch.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,48,Zero tolerance for places that serve food making their workers come in sick. Nobody wants to buy food from someone who s coughing  sneezing  runny nose  watery eyes  and looks like they are dying. Now were stuck with food we can t eat. What a waste of money. With all the regulations around cleanliness  how can you clearly not see how much of a health hazard this is   Zero stars for selling food you can t eat.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,49,Hands down worst borritto I ve ever had.  The staff could not have cared less.  The woman simple wadded  my borritto into a ball.  0 stars if i could.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,50,Not a good location for Celiacs. I ve been eating at Chipotle successfully for years after my Celiac diagnosis until today. I said I have a food allergy at the beginning so she changed her gloves  then proceeds to throw it down the line to someone who didn t have new gloves. They changed after placing hands all over and inside the bowl and gave me a salsa that was pre made. Well   ended up sick immediately  What a bummer  this was always an easy go to.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,51,My friend and I ate lunch there yesterday. We got the burrito bowl with half chicken and half beef. We both spent the rest of the day throwing up and stomach upset. Called the Manager who instead of apologizing was extremely rude. All I wanted was to let them know so they could check what was wrong so more people don t fall sick. But oh well...take your chances in that place. This was the Arbor Walk location just fyi
Chipotle Mexican Grill,52,Why are you doing this to me   What have I ever done except love you and come to you every week and give you money    When others praise Freebird s I always stick up for you.   - ....  The past 4 times I ve been to this particular Chipotle they have made my chicken burrito extra tiny and wrapped carelessly.  Wrapped isn t even the word for it.  It s folded and smushed into some foil.  The lettuce is all over the place  when you bite into it  there are areas of tortilla that when they wrap it  it overlaps onto itself so it s super thick with tortilla and you hafta peel it away but when you do it undoes itself like a sweater with loose yarn. I know it s gonna overlap  but how they managed to wrap it to where it s like 5 layers of tortilla from one damn tortilla is beyond me.   I m happy I m alone when eating Chipotle b c it s the most unattractive  messiest thing ever.  Hands-behind-the-back pie eating contests are carried out with more grace.   I need a new Chipotle to go to.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,53,I have been wanting to try Chipotle because I love burritos and hate Freebird World Burrito so I wanted to check out the competition.  Gross.  The steak was bland  chewy and indelible.  The burrito was the shape of a cheese burger  there was nothing cylindrical about it.  The rice was bland  the hyped guacamole was brown and nothing was evenly distributed.  I had two bites and tossed it.  As much as I don t care for them  I will have to say Freebird is better.  I can say the staff was pleasant and the restaurant was clean.  We got there 30 minutes before closing but staff was fresh and polite.  Too bad the food wasn t.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,54,I stepped on the scale this morning and lost three pounds. You know what that means  I am compelled to sabotage it with a trip to an eatery where I can order up 1 000 calories in one meal. I m talking about big-hunking burritos. I m talking Chipotle.  I am normally not a fan of Chipotle. Of all the big-hunking burrito chains  this one ranks pretty low on my list already for several reasons I won t get into here. But mainly  they just do not offer a big enough variety for my taste.  However  as it turns out today I was running an errand at the Arbor Walk and decided to buy my lunch at this Chipotle location. I figured since I ran 4 miles this morning and was heading to the office for who knows how long on a friggin Sunday  I should get something substantial to tide me over until my dinner of  most likely  beer while laying on the couch watching the Olympics.  Honestly  I really think I m going to keep off that three pounds...   When I walked in  the girl was staring off into space and someone had to point me out to her. After reading other reviews  this seems pretty normal at this location. I asked for the small size burrito while indicating the size with my hands cupped in half-moon shapes connected at the fingertips  same as the international symbol for  may I have a small side of ranch dressing  . The lady behind the counter and I went a couple of rounds of  we don t have smaller  and I thought she couldn t hear me because the music was so G.D. loud in there  and then I realized I am thinking of the Freebird s option  they have multiple sizes . So I was fine with their size. Not a big deal.  She asked me if I wanted beans and rice. I said black beans  no rice. So she pulls out the tortilla and I see her scoop up the rice and I said  no rice please  just beans.  She evidently did not hear me from the loud-ass music they re playing in there as if to mask the fact that their service is lax  so I raised my voice and said  NO RICE   My loudness and the context of what I said made me stop and think how ridiculous this place is.   I went down the line and chose my fillers. She asked me if I wanted guacamole and mumbled something. I said   yes  but what did you say   She said there is an extra charge  thinking it s probably like 50 cents or something small. I said that s fine. At the cash register  the guy who d pointed me out to the space cadet earlier rang up my total of  9.09. WTF  For a burrito and a soda  I found out that dollop of guacamole cost  1.50    I was like   This place is ignorant   I know  I know - I was the one paying for it  but I walked out thinking that I could buy an avocado for less and mash it up and put it in the burrito myself. A dollar fifty for guacamole is highway robbery if you ask me. Does your guacamole make me poo gold  Chipotle  I guess we ll have to wait and see.   I am giving them an extra star because of their little story on the side of the soda cup about Wes Jackson and his revolutionary achievements in agriculture. I bet he gets his guac comp d.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,55,I know what you re thinking  seriously   a chipotle review   umm..    but I felt obliged to review this location as I visit this particular location so often   I definitely enjoy this location s patio  amp  proximity to shopping joints such as dsw  amp  marshall s.  only con is lunch time traffic in this shopping center  but it s manageable.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,56,Raymond was awesome. Very polite  and politically correct with wishing me  happy holidays   made the best damn salad I ve ever had at chipotle. Shout out to the person that made the dressing today. It was on point.  I m giving this review five stars because of the service provided by Raymond  however I d like to say that Julio was horrible. Rude to not only me and my boyfriend  but all his coworkers around him. After being called up to the register for cash  he came up after the second or third time being called  during lunch hours   said  what cash   Even though I was very obviously ready to pay  and went to the back with a smirk. After I asked him his name he tried to explain his rudeness to me by saying he had been arguing with his coworkers all day. Very unprofessional and unpleasant experience with Julio.  I ve worked in customer service for years  I understand what it s like to not get along with a coworker  but it s never a good idea to display it to the consumer. To management  I hope you correct this situation between the two employees  Raymond would do very well at the Anderson Location  they are all very polite  and are always trying to put a smile on people s faces. To Julio  I don t mean this to offend you  I just hope it helps as constructive criticism so you can keep moving forward. To Raymond  great job man and keep up the positive attitude.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,57,One of the best Chipotle s I have been to    Their meat is seasoned very well   They get you out fast  without wrapping a burrito sloppy during lunch rush It s in the Arbor walk  So you can shop until you re hungry then BAM Chipotle  I m a fan 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,58,I realize I m reviewing a chain restaurant in Austin.  Okay  now that that s out of the way - let s be real.  They have failed on the most basic and quintessential element of a great burrito - wrapping.  I can t tell you how many times I have been here  ordered a burrito  and started to eat it only to find that it starts to fall apart after the second bite because the person who put it together was completely inept.  I brought home a burrito today only to find that it had been loosely put together to where the foil didn t even reach around the sides   It might be okay if I had ordered something with double meat or an extremely large burrito  but unfortunately  that wasn t the case.  Burrito insides everywhere.   firstworldproblems
Chipotle Mexican Grill,59,This isn t a review of Chipotle chain as a whole  instead the focus is this particular instance of the Chipotle object.    Here s what s bad about this one  Never any salt on the chips Cheap with the meat Cheap with the rice Cheap with the beans Diet Dr. Pepper is always super freaking foamy Chicks behind the counter don t understand  No guacamole  even though its the same in English or Spanish so no freaking telling what their native tongue is  The good  awesome bathroom if you re in dire need of one at Arbor Walk  Its a sad state for a Chipotle if they re getting their socks handed to them during the yuppie lunch rush hour by a mediocre buger joint with horrible fries next door.  Yeah  I m bitter that this is the closest Chipotle to both my work and home  and somehow repeatedly forget how disappointing it is until I ve crossed the point of no return.  Save yourself the pain  bypass this one and go to Lakeline  45th Lamar  or Parmer for Chip the way its meant to be.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,60,Do yourself a favor and go to the new location on Anderson Ln instead. This location skimps on ingredients and is located in the terribly designed Arbor Walk shopping center. The 50 speed bumps  pedestrians that think they can just walk in front of moving cars  and lack of entrances exits make this one of the most frustrating shopping centers to navigate I ve ever been to.  P.S. don t even think about the salad dressing. It has 25  grams of fat ALONE. Pure oil.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,61,ZERO IF I COULD    Got a gift card  never been there  love CRISPY TACOS  my Tex-Mex food of choice  NONE SERVED HERE. So I tried the  cafeteria system  soft tacos  ....two tries of take out  5 mins to home. Results  Big Mistake  Overpriced franchise  8. for 3 soggy bottoms falling out  a mushy mess  ....gag    I wouldn t eat there ever again if it were free  or....even if someone paid me. For no-brainer crispy tacos   other menu items  I totally prefer Taco Bell or Taco Cabana  not to mention much better real Mexican restaurants all over Austin. LD.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,62,Sometimes it s hard to beat a big  tasty burrito.  I don t know who came up with the concept of the modern burrito  with rice  beans  cheese  specialty meats  and all the extra fixin s - but obviously  that person was a genius.  Since Chipotle burritos are custom made to your specs  let me give you my recommendation on the  1 best burrito that can be made from the ingredients Chipotle offers.  Here s what you tell the gal behind the counter  and yes  19 times out of 20  it will be a gal  and she will be a recent immigrant.  Chipotle is kind of old school in this regard.   -Burrito -Rice -Pinto Beans  for God s sake  trust me here  and deny that pesky black bean urge that you have.  -Barbacoa  that s the Mexican style shredded bbq beef  -Pico -Sour Cream -Cheese  you may have to ask for a touch extra  Lettuce Done   That means no corn salsa  or any of that other silly junk.    There you go.  That s a 100  Jonathan W. Approved and Guaranteed burrito  developed through years of experimentation.  Deviate from this formula at your own risk.  My take on the Chipotle concept  -- Chipotle  as you know  is a chain  at one time affiliated with the dreaded McDonald s Corp.  who has since divested its financial interest.   So if you hate McDonald s  rest assured that not one cent of Chipotle s profits go to the evil corporation.  Now  despite the fact that Chipotle is a chain  and that there are other specialty burrito chains  namely Freebirds and Q-doba  I feel that Chipotle offers a fairly unique product.  And they do so with remarkable consistency from location to location.  So  for better or worse  if you ve been to one Chipotle - you ve been to them all.  Which also means I will probably cut and paste the lion s share of this review for the many Chipotle locations I have visited  and intend to visit in the future.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,63,had to come back and give them an extra star because the steak tacos were finally on point and the chips were great again but lost another star because the guac hasnt improved since my last visit.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,64,Food is good here  but they really need to learn how to roll a burrito. Other burrito places do it much better
Chipotle Mexican Grill,65,Watching calories can be done  and Chipotle is one of my favorite places to dine when I want to feel full but avoid a calorie binge. I choose the bowl and ditch the tortilla.  This is my bowl  -Rice -Black Beans  I ask for a little more beans and skip the onions pepper blend and corn relish  -Pico and a little of the medium hot sauce -Cheese -Guacamole -Lettuce Voila... a large amount of food for around 600 calories.   I ve never had problems with the employees at this location... partly because I anticipate the next question and SMILE when ordering.  The smile is usually returned and they throw on some more lettuce because they think i m a vegetarian a friend to bovines.  This seems to be the case at all locations... but i m also not a demanding guest looking for a long term relationship.    I d make the rice at home if I could find a comparable recipe.  Anyone have one 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,66,This crew and management rock  Always with smiles and cheerful attitudes  tasty food and they remember their repeat customers.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,67,food is great but don t buy food online. i recently had a bad experience when buying online. they kept advertising free delivery. so i gave it a try. i normally drive there but i couldn t because of s business meeting. so i gave it try. 20 minutes later i checked back to see if order was on its way and come to find out the order was cancelled. i called chipotle and they told me i need to call doordash. the driver cancelled my order. i called doordash and they tell me its no their fault call chipotle. i call chipotle and they say no its doordash fault. i gave up  cancelled my meeting  drove up my self to pick it up. why offer online if they cant meet handle stuff like this. manager only gave one free burito but my coworker got nothing since i ordered two meals. never again    
Chipotle Mexican Grill,68,I ll never forget the first time I had Chipotle back in my college days in Northern Virginia. It was amazing and automatically one of my favorite things. The nice thing about Chiptole is for the most part the food is identical everywhere so you know what you are getting. When I come here  the staff is great. I come here during lunch and the lines are always kind of long but they move fast and the people are awesome. I m there probably once or twice a month and I don t plan on ever stopping 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,69,Very consistent quality service and food. Chipotle at Arbor Walk better managed than other Chipoltes I have been to.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,70,I can only vouch for the veggie bowl at dinner time. It s all I ever get here. I love it. And they have great iced tea. Pros  fast service  fresh ingredients  outdoor seating  management seems to be on top of things. It s never busy when I ve been there for a late dinner. I guess that s probably not a good thing. Cons  location. I really dislike Arbor walk. It is hard to get in and out. And who decided to put speed bumps every 15 feet  yikes.  Also  they need to tone down the music - I don t like sitting inside because it s too loud. ...but I ll be back.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,71,How can you be a burrito place and not have queso   Do I like their burritos  Yes  but not having queso is a travesty   Other cons  really thick chips  no  meal deal  type option  Freebirds and Qdoba both let you add chips and a drink for a minimal extra charge   the carnitas is really greasy
Chipotle Mexican Grill,72,Not only a nice staff  always but I was sitting in enjoying my dinner and a deaf family walked in and they had An employee who signed  I was blown away how awesome that was. Love this location.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,73,I went to Chipotle because their rewards system is ending soon and I wanted to claim my free chips and guac. The coupon wasn t showing up on my phone and I couldn t figure it out. Loren used a coupon code for me so I could get free chips and guac. It was super awesome of him to do that and things like that go a long way for me. This Chipotle always has great service and everyone is always really nice. I definitely recommend going to this location   
Chipotle Mexican Grill,74,I m personally a fan of Chipotle. I will say they don t have a huge variety of options  especially when it comes to added toppings in your burrito or salad. If you want all different kinds of veggies or options you may want to check out Freebirds. Every time I have got in the girls have been friendly. I will say that there has been a time that my burrito seemed a little on the  light  side when it comes to how they are normally made.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,75,By far the best chipotle in Austin. Be warned  REEEEALLY BUSY during lunch  IBM  the Domain  and JJ Pickle are practically next door . But they got it taken care of  I ve never had less than 100  from them  and I ve seen some really weird crap go down in other parts of town. The produce must either have a really high turnover rate  or actually just be made well  or probably both.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,76,This review is for this store only.  Every time I ve been to this Chipotle I wonder why I wasted my money here.  The chicken is never fresh and tastes funny and to add insult to injury they skimp on the toppings  compared to other Chipotles .  I ve marked this one off my list of places to eat cause it hasn t been good in a long time.  Save yourself the money and the trouble of coming here because there are much better places to eat.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,77,The big guy at the beginning of the line was stingy with the rice and beans  so much so that I had to ask for a little more. Next he was cheap on the meat. I basically had a vegetarian bowl. Looks like this location has a history of skimping on the servings. Extremely disappointed and still hungry. Never coming back to this location.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,78,I don t know how Chipotle does it  but I ve never had a bad experience there.  The Harvard Business School should do a case study on their management style  because they re doing a lot of things right.  I go to Chipotle often and I am amazed by their consistency.  It rivals the consistency of McDonalds  but nukes them out of the water on quality  value  service  healthiness  and taste.   This location is just as Great as the other   Keep up the good work   I am a big fan.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,79,This is another really good Chipotle  but I almost never go here cuz I pass like 9 other Chipotles on the way.  They give you TONS of food  they have alcohol  and the people there are really nice.  I also really like how the seating is arranged.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,80,I eat here at least once a week cause it s always health  good  fast  and in expensive.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,81,If advertising organic products and gold ingredients means that you sell bland rubbish that doesn t even come close to being actual Mexican food..... then Chipotle has the market cornered.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,82,I really enjoy ordering the bowl option instead of the burrito. It offers you more ingredients and less starch. The salsa is awesome and I always ask for a side of it to take home with me. This place rocks and the staff is very professional as well 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,83,The first time I went to this particular Chipotle  it was okay.  The last few times  it has disappointed me.  The employees seem distracted and unhappy to be at work.  I guess they want to take out that frustration on me  because they make the sloppiest soft tacos I ve ever seen   and they ve started totally skimping on the meat.  I get literally 1 2 as much as I get at the Mueller Chipotle.  The manager indicated that they cut the portion from 5oz to 4oz due to increased meat prices  but seriously  I got about 2 oz  they don t weigh it at all  so it s easy to under-serve people . To his credit the manager packed up a little ramekin of barbacoa for me to add to my burrito  but that really didn t make up for it.  You can t just disassemble and reassemble those things without damaging their structural integrity.  I hope another  better Chipotle opens in NW Austin because I think they make good food and this place doesn t do it justice.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,84,I dont know what it is but all they cook here upsets my stomach... even the brown rice... I dont think I ll go back. I ve tried 3 times and always the same result  discomfort after lunch for like 7 hours.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,85,I love the crispy tacos. Steak  pico  medium salsa  cheese  guacamole  and lettuce. With chips and medium salsa. Excellent food. Not five stars because the price is a little high.
Birria Queen ,1,The food was delicious. I ordered the Birria tacos can t wait to get more  I ll definitely be a regular.
Birria Queen ,2,I was craving Birria for weeks  and as you can imagine  my phone knew exactly what to surface in my direction. Saw a post from Birria Queen on my Facebook and immediately decided to check it out. I will say  I was a little shocked when I pulled up to the address and it was being served out of an apartment  but the food itself was fantastic. I ll definitely be back to get some tacos again 
Birria Queen ,3,My lash lift lady recommended me to Birria Queen stating that this was the best birria place she has had in the city. We got the tacos  ramen  and grilled cheese. It was amazing  Very authentic tasting and delicious. FYI  it is cash only but completely worth it. My partner said that she is very nice and friendly. The Birria Queen lives up to her name  Don t have any photos because we devoured everything.   
Birria Queen ,4,This is the best Birria taco I have ever had  Never judge a book by its cover  food was served out of an apartment window which might seem weird to some people.  But take a chance and you will be hooked  The lady who cooked and served was awesome and very nice    I will be back   
Birria Queen ,5,Holy  hit this place is legit  Worth the drive from Liberty Hill  Birria was delicious but the consomm  was AMAZING  This queen knows what she s doing  I had the crispy and soft Birria tacos first time trying the soft and was not disappointed  100  Will be back  Hoping she caters 
Birria Queen ,6,the birria ramen is something I dream about on the daily. Thank you BQ               
Chipotle Mexican Grill,1,Haven t been to Chipotle in a while. Did not want to cook today. This was a great substitution. I love the choices they provide. The chicken is tender and grilled. Love the veggies. Tasty 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,2,I m reading thru all the sad online reviews and how online orders are always wrong  well I d like to join y all in that misery except that I actually had the luxury of eating there in person this afternoon. First let me say that I was happy to see the trays fully stocked with food as I entered  It was ALMOST all downhill from there. As I m giving instructions on how to make my bowl  I tell the girl to add medium salsa which she did  but then she added mild salsa even though I didn t tell her to. I didn t say anything because I do like mild salsa so that s not going to ruin my meal but it s disappointing that she just added some crap that I didn t request. I then arrived at the register and asked for chips with my bowl and the guy on register didn t give me the chips  at least he was consistent and didn t charge me for them either so I decided not to make a big deal out of that blunder either. The food was decent-tasting and up to standard and that s how this location avoided getting a one star review from me. If the workers are making these kinds of mistakes with customers who are actually there telling them what to do then I can only imagine how large the mistakes are for online orders.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,3,Sadly this may be the worst queso I ve ever consumed.  Something was off  it didn t really taste like cheese just some kinda sour after taste. Won t be back  if the queso is bad how can I trust anything else.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,4,If i could give this chipotle 0 starts i would. I literally will never expect anything less than extremely rude and entitled people that work here. When you order tacos they throw all the tortillas on foil then dump the ingredients all over it. The way they package it up is by rolling all of the mess into foil.   So today i decided to ask them to put them in a tray since she had dumped the food all over the taco and no joke she rolls her eyes at me then looks at the girl at the register and starts talking sh t about me in Spanish not knowing both my husband and i speak fluent Spanish.   I can handle crappy food since it s chipotle but to be blatantly disrespected like that is insane. Get a new job if you hate it so bad.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,5,I don t understand why people keep ordering from here. There are so many better options now. In a moment of weakness and working tons of overtime  I made the regretful decision to order another sad bowl of beans  rice and meat from this place. Just know  if you don t go in person to supervise the making of your bowl  IT WILL BE WRONG. This evening they just completely stopped after the carnitas and left out the salsa  corn  sour cream  cheese  and lettuce. Another sad  12 that I should have just spent at HEB or one of the restaurants next door.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,6,In my many years of eating Chipotle  this is hands down the WORST location Chipotle meal I ve ever had. No doubt. I was so disappointed eating this that halfway through I decided this needed to be addressed for future customers.  I ve never had such large  clunky chunks of veggies or chicken at any other location. I ate an onion so large it might as well been an onion ring. This is harder to explain  but it felt oddly wet when I was eating it. Not wet as in coated perfectly with sauce  but wet like someone dumped water in it... something had excessive moisture in a bad way. Lastly  these were the smallest portion sizes I ve ever received. If I m charged by my meat choice and amount of meat  then I expect one full scoop  not a chunk of chicken that clearly wasn t cut properly.   Chipotle is a solid staple in my diet as it should be yours. Just do yourself a favor and go to another location. Otherwise it ll fail to stand up to its normal  delicious consistency. I m highly disappointed and will drive out of my way to get my Chipotle full at a more reliable location.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,7,Where did the days go of friendly smiles and personable service  Now days not one single employee cares to be there. Sad times.  Not just a one time experience or it wouldn t be worth mentioning.  Portions were also pretty small compared to most other locations.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,8,The food is great as always  the only problem is the parking for Mueller. That is the only drop in rating  but I ll still go for the great tacos and bowls 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,9,If you are gonna work  then you might as well perform your job correctly   Half the order is wrong  the Rewards points for free chips n salsa is missing and the driver didn t even get out of his lazy vehicle.  Cmon... Y all can do better than this for  22
Chipotle Mexican Grill,10,The girl who charges you was so unnecessarily rude. I wish I asked for her name so I could call her out on this review  but I was so bewildered. She was rude out of no where. She asked me if that was all for my order and just pointed at the bag. I said yes because I thought they had put all my order in the bag so when I noticed she hadn t charged me for the other burrito  I told her and she responded  That s why I asked you if that was all.  Huh  Sorry you hate your job.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,11,This location gives pretty skimpy servings. Other than that  it provides your standard Chipotle offerings and tastes just fine.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,12,Don t order online using mobile app or Uber Eats app  because if like me  you will wait 75 minutes and order will end up being cancelled. If don t want business  why open restaurant at all  Management at this Chipotle location obviously doesn t care and needs to be fired bc looking back at other 1 star reviews  this problem has been happening for months if not years at this location.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,13,worst chipotle ive been too  amp  ive been too all of them around austin round rock san marcos just horrible asked for veggies game me 5 strips of bell peppers asked for steak got 4 pieces of steak im not exaggerating
Chipotle Mexican Grill,14,I tried to give this place so many chances to get it right  But every time I visit this specific location the service is absolute TRASH     The employees make ur burrito either skimpy as hell or when u ask for sour cream or red sauce they completely smother it  To the point I ve had to TRASH several burritos I paid almost  10 for. The employees don t greet you and always seem bothered to be there I understand the pay probably isn t that great but please don t take it out on good paying customers   
Chipotle Mexican Grill,15,I ve been to Chipotle location all across the country  visited hundreds of times  maybe thousands after 20  years now  and this is certainly one of the worst I ve ever been to. Unfortunately it s the one closest to my house.     I m finally having to call them out.   They re nice enough people  but this is just so poorly run. They re always short on things on the line  it s a mess  the person at cash doesn t know this or that  they give you barely any food  and it s cold  for an online order  etc. It s just something every single time. Where is the management for this place  The negative reviews I see are not surprising at all. Completely jives with my experience. Most unfortunate because as I said  this is the one I kind of have to go to if I want Chipotle.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,16,Great  fast service. Best chipotle in the local area. I typically get 2-3 bowls and the staff are patient as I run through the order. The place is clean and staff are accommodating and kind.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,17,This place always is terrible on their portion sizes and they are frequently closed during the middle of the days because they re  out of food .  How does chipotle run out of food    This location is terrible.  Totally clueless staff.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,18,Wow this is the worst chipotle I ever eat .long line and they don t care customer and the food common I F paid 12 and they put just May be 7spoons food .   Be aware guys you have other place to eat
Chipotle Mexican Grill,19,The place was very crowded due to a long line. People were not social distancing. The staff didn t care. They were also receiving a delivery and had boxes and boxes of food stacked outside. The delivery drive had to come through the line to deliver. He was on his phone and not being mindful of the people in line. We had to jump back to make sure he didn t hit us. The cooking area had multiple piles of dirty dishes and the door that led to where the delivery driver was going opened up to a filthy backroom.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,20,Wherever I order via their app  they always manage to mess up the whole order. Instead of giving me light sour cream  they literally drowned my entire bowl in sour cream  it was probably the most sour cream I ve ever seen  and I had to try to salvage it by scooping globs of sour cream out. Instead of giving me extra corn  they give me NO corn. And they give me onions and peppers when I didn t even order any. I don t know how a chipotle bowl can get this messed up.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,21,I had never really had bad customer service here until today. One of the ladies just seemed like she didn t want to serve me and she interrupted me while I was asking a question. I was in medical scrubs. Disrespectful. I hadn t had bad service here before by anyone else.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,22,Open during covid and taking some precautions. Social distancing not truly enforced. Hand sanitizer at the door. Convenient to order online and walk in past the line for pick up. Can t really go wrong with Chipotle. Just wish the queso was better tasting  it s okay.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,23,I do not know who is on the grill at this Chipotle tonight  but she he should immediately be moved. I love Chipotle and normally have no complaints  but this chicken is so  blackened  burnt  I can not enjoy it at all. I m beyond disappointed 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,24,Literally the worst Chipotle in Austin  slowest service and rude staff  I was in a rush and my food was sitting there for minutes getting cold while employees chit-chat about 4th period  when I asked if she could ring me up she got upset and threw a fit  no wonder they have the worst rating on Yelp
Chipotle Mexican Grill,25,Watched them make someone else s order then ended up leaving. Half scoop serving sizes at best here. If you do decide to go make sure to not order online. Saw them making someone s online order and it was even less food. It s almost as if they are taking their bad day out on you. There is a free birds a few miles away that will at least give you the recommended serving size. I ll try this location out later on when they get different employees.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,26,Went there to pick up mu lunch today. Usually i go to the downtown location. This place is quiet small compared to the that location. not much places to sit  especially if you are in a large group. Though they have a beautiful patio sitting. Which is awesome.  Food is always good here  maintaining their standards and quality throughout all location. Staff was very courteous  amp  friendly which definitely makes a customer happy. Service was super quick   
Chipotle Mexican Grill,27,On Halloween they had a bogo and i got two bowls. It was exactly what you d expect from Chipotle. Straight gas and the best part is you get twice as much gas for only half the price. This is one of the best Mexican places in the United States of America especially better than Cabo Bob s. Not sure why anyone would want Cabo Bob s when Chipotle is such gas. Cobo Bob s is not gas at all. If you do find yourself at Chipotle don t make the mistake of getting a burrito get a bowl with a tortilla side for a DIY burrito. That way you get more gas for a better price.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,28,Came in today at 9 30 and they were out of chicken and told me it would take a long rime to cook   Super pissed and unacceptable Bc they close at ten   Decided to wait Bc this was the only option of food open . Evelio made everything okay she comped our meals and apologized    This being the only reason for the stars   Really hope she is the only one who gets the tip I personally handed to her she deserved it . Btw 4 more people showed up behind us and get to have dinner Bc we stayed and made them make the chicken    Way to go Evelio u made our night   
Chipotle Mexican Grill,29,Went for lunch. They are doing an excellent job at getting people in and out quickly and safely. Food was very good. Ate outside and tables were spaced  and customers all had masks and were being good citizens. Win win   Felt very safe and food was very good. Thanks 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,30,Best chipotle out there   They actually fill our bowls compared to other locations  Go to this one   I m telling you. Also  they have good customer service been here four times and each time was amazing.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,31,I usually go to N Lamar for chipotle cause it s on my way to work but since I had a craving and I was around the place I decided to go there. I m still feeling angry at the condescending attitude from the employees and they were not even paying attention to me when I was saying my order  I had to repeat it at least 5 times and there was people behind me and the employees were acting like it was my fault even if I was telling them what I wanted VERY specifically. At the end one of the ladies told the cashier in Spanish  WHICH IS MY MOTHER LANGUAGE   to charge me quickly so I could get out of there  of course  using very very  colorful  and rude language that it seems she thought I couldn t understand BUT I DID . And the worst of all of this is that when I m already at home I get surprised by finding HAIRS ON MY FOOD  also pico de Gallo wasn t fresh at all.   So yeah  whoever wants to eat chipotle I recommend you to go anywhere else  there are many in the city  cause this location is a waste of space in such a good neighborhood
Chipotle Mexican Grill,32,Horrible   To go orders were all scattered and didnt even try to put any food on my bowl. Never again at this location
Chipotle Mexican Grill,33,Worst customer service ever. i love chipotle  but because of how i was treated here i will never visit a chipotle ever again. If these are the kind of people they hire then i dont even want to support them. I get better treatment at a McDonalds than here. Sorry but you have lost my patronage.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,34,These dudes can t get an online order right  ever. I either have an incomplete delivery order when I use this location  or when I pick it up myself  I have to check the food in the parking lot to make sure it s right and then inevitably head back in to correct it. Never order double protein from this location because they will always miss it. If they made the mistake one or two times  I d be more understanding  but it s like 4 5 orders wrong and now I have to write a review.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,35,I used  a href   redir url http 3A 2F 2FChipotle.com amp s adb2a28a82f8dfab3b8dbc80f2ed0ce63d8be8db20663ea81a232393f6706fc5  rel  nofollow  target  _blank  Chipotle.com  a  to get a delivery from this location.  The food arrived and half the order was missing. I called the location and was told they could  probably remake it  but would have to come pick it up myself.   If I wanted to go pick it up I would ve done so in the first place.  After being on hold and finally told the manager was  too busy  to talk to me  I just asked for a refund.  I was told I would have to go to  a href   redir url http 3A 2F 2FChipotle.com amp s adb2a28a82f8dfab3b8dbc80f2ed0ce63d8be8db20663ea81a232393f6706fc5  rel  nofollow  target  _blank  Chipotle.com  a  for that.  I could hear the manager telling her employee what to say... still wouldn t get on the phone with me.  It was so annoying and took up a lot of time we were trying to have for family night. Best part  I asked for the manager s name and was told  I don t know her name  maybe Maria.   Seriously     Totally disappointed.    
Chipotle Mexican Grill,36,Good service and food  I come to this chipotle regularly and have not been disappointed. The staff is friendly and meals are usually fulfilling.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,37,So we re on a diet which means salad  salad and salad. So we ve been going to the chipotle on Lamar for chipotle salads but this one is closer so I suggested we try this one.  My boyfriend had been here before and was like no this one is terrible they don t listen to you. But I m like you went on a weekday when it was busy it s the weekend maybe it ll be great.  I was wrong - they don t listen.   They were a little busy but not crazy or busy by chipotle standards at all but it seemed like they were desperate to rush us through the line.   My boyfriend only wanted mild and corn but they put every salsa on and he tried to stop her but she literally wasn t listening. I was like do you want them to remake it  But we went with it  we got to cheese to ask for extra cheese. Cheese  Yes extra cheese. A second later - Cheese  Yes....extra cheese.  Plops on tinyest amount of cheese ever  uhm could we get extra cheese  Pushes bowl to register.   Back to Lamar 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,38,We debated driving to a location with a rating higher than 3 stars and ended up deciding against it  and now I wish we had. We were the only people in the store  were met with no greeting and then we proceeded to wait for ten minutes until someone would take our order. When we went to pay the cashier did not even bother me to wait at the register but instead went to the back of the store without offering my receipt. All three workers seemed to be in horrible moods and I would not recommend this location if you have the time to go anywhere else.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,39,Honestly havent been disapointed yet  normally get the burrito and salad bowel  delivery can skimp on fillings but over all not bad  
Chipotle Mexican Grill,40,Chipotle is a guilty pleasure but I really do enjoy it. You can absolutely make the argument that it is not real Mexican food  but you know what I say to that    There is a time for authentic Mexican food  and there is a time for Chipotle. They re not trying to be authentic  they re trying to be tasty  They ve certainly succeeded at that.  I ve been loyal at this particular branch for a while now. One of the coolest things that I ve noticed about Chipotle  at multiple locations  is after a while the employees start to recognize you and throw in extra perks for your repeat business.   It s a great way to give loyalty discounts  and also kinda make you feel like you re appreciated. Maybe that sounds silly to you  but that extra touch definitely made the difference for me 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,41,Definitely meh.  The food is good quality. Here s the problem. There s just not much variety as far as toppings go.  And the only non-chunky salsa is an insanely hot salsa that only adds heat  not flavor.  Count me firmly in the Freebirds or Cabo Bob s camps.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,42,Pros   -fast service  even when there s a long line  -meat is always juicy   Cons   -my biggest complaint  what happened to the portion size    My most recent visit there  the lady gave me a little scoop of chicken. I was so disappointed   -there s really only seating for two to four people. The dining area is really narrow  so you d likely end up eating three feet away from the assembly line of workers if you don t go outside to eat. Not good for big groups.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,43,This place is terrible. They shake pretty much all the meat off but when it comes to the other items they ll give you a huge scoop. When I ask for the meat they shook off they charge me like  4 for  extra  meat. There are other burrito restaurants around this chipotle. Go there instead. They won t over charge you like this place.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,44,I found a roach in my bowl    -- My lunch was ruined that day and the manager did not want to refund me my money. I will no longer be visiting this location  I have had issues at this location multiple times  but this is the final straw 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,45,Swung by here for a quick snack lunch.  Got chicken tacos.  They were delish  haven t eaten Chipotle for awhile.  Ate outside  the nice thing about that is the birds stalk you the whole time.  When you stand up they bombard the table and clean it in 3 seconds flat.   No i m not kidding   Fast and good food  not busy for a weekend.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,46,Very disappointed. This is the second time my boyfriend and I have ordered pick up delivery from this location and have received minimal amounts of food. Hardly any protein  minimal greens  and a laughable amount of salsa. We love Chipotle  but we will be sure to only dine-in from now on.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,47,I may have eaten here once before  and for some reason I thought my second time should be through a delivery service. Not sure why I wasted the extra money on chipotle. Ordered tacos on corn and I got them on flour. I m celiac so they went in the trash.   cornmeanscorn
Chipotle Mexican Grill,48,This is honestly one of the worse locations ever. I ve given this place so many chances but today is definitely the last day I ll ever go. They re incredibly inconsistent with everything. You d think they listen to how you want your order but they ll look you right in the face and do everything wrong. Besides customer service being frustrating the food isn t fresh most if not all the times I ve gone. Hope they get their stuff together.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,49,My cousins went to eat at Chipotle Mexican Grill here  in Austin  Texas and got REALLY SICK a couple of hours later. I do not understand why people continue to eat at this restaurant. They are to be avoided at all costs.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,50,I m not new to the chipotle scene  but new to this location which is why I gave the low rating.   The bag of chips I bought were completely stale and in the guac I found pieces of the shell and the stem.   Could be a one time thing  but Definitely won t be putting that to the test.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,51,Food was decent  normal Chipotle  but the SERVICE was quite disappointing. It was strange. It felt like we were intruding on their day or something. And we are friendly  smiley people  It was like they were all in their own world back behind the counter  amp  having to go out of their way to fix our food and ring us up.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,52,Bad experience with this place and their catering department. We placed an order for our staff meeting. First  you have to call their 1-800   to place a catering order rather than dealing with the local store. I don t like dealing with the 1-800   because it seems they don t exactly sync with whatever local store you end up using. For example  we are tax exempt  however  the catering line cannot remove the taxes on delivered orders. You can only do that by going into the store itself. No other place does that.   But  the worst thing was when the delivery driver forgot part of our order and how much trouble it was to get the matter taken care of. So I called the local store to have them bring the rest of our order. I was then informed  by someone who I could barely understand  that they don t do the deliveries. They use Door Dash even for the catering jobs. So they blamed the Door Dash guy saying they had all of the order but he forgot it and I need to call the catering line. Then I called the catering line and explained what happened. Then they put me on hold while they called the local store  then came back and put me on hold while they called Door Dash. Meanwhile  my meeting was about to break for lunch. So the catering line person came back and said Door Dash would bring the rest of our order. OK  fine. So I went back to the meeting and a few minutes later I heard this loud BANG. I didn t think much about it  but a few minutes later I left to wait for the delivery  thinking they would call me from the front desk  and there was my order sitting on a table. The Door Dash person apparently brought the rest of our food and slammed it on the table loud enough to make the loud bang sound. At this point I was just hoping no one spit in our queso  Was he mad for a mistake HE made   So is my beef with Door Dash  the local store  or the Chipotle catering line  The truth is I don t know either  but in my opinion  the 3 entities should have worked together and they didn t. So until that is cleared up  we won t be ordering from Chipotle again. The food wasn t that great anyway - ice cold tortillas and dry meat. Thank goodness we were able to nuke the tortillas.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,53,It s good food.  Don t ask for extra sour cream when ordering online though... Woah. I m drowning in cream  Think I shall word it quite differently next time...
Chipotle Mexican Grill,54,Thanks Chipotle  for eliminating crappy fast food burger joints from my diet. And no  I don t care that your burritos contain over 1000 calories. You know what they say  the more the merrier.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,55,if you get a salad here... please  please please skip the sour cream. OMG that was gross. the rest of it was ok.   the bf got the salad b c I did and he enjoyed hiswith beans and rice. I had to get it without the rice.  try it.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,56,2.5 stars.  Every now and then I ll order at a place like this and they ll ask me   Will this be for here or to go   and I ll say  for here.  And for some reason they ll still wrap it up to go.  I know this is most likely due to bored  inattentive employees going through the motions and forgetting what I just  a minute or two ago  said.  But I can t help but feel like it s a passive-aggressive signal that they really want me to take my food and get out.   Anyway  I got my barbacoa burrito and after taking it out of the bag and unwrapping it  sat at a table  as I had intended to do all along. This was my first trip to Chipotle  and I d heard good things. I think people who rave about it probably live in places without Mexican food. It isn t bad at all  and in Austin we don t have many places that serve burritos  so I was happy to try it. But it isn t as good as Freebirds and it s nowhere near as good as Cabo Bob s.  Rice in a burrito  I know that s standard at some places. But it s weird. A carb wrapped in a carb. Like french fries on a hamburger. Some people think it s a good idea. It isn t.  Halfway through my meal  a pink  watery liquid was draining out from my burrito. I guess the water from the salsa was mixing with the water from the beans  but it mixed with my sour cream to make an unappetizing  soggy mess.  Tables were dirty  drink selection was meh  iced tea  Powerade  Mr. Pibb  and about four Coke products . There s a patio that s probably nice on a sunny  warm day.  It s a big meal for one person. I brought home 1 3 of it for another day  though I m not sure if the watery salsa runoff will make it too gross to eat.  Smashburger is just down the street.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,57,On Thursday  July 12th  I ate dinner at this location and came down with food poisoning from a salad with steak. I haven t left the bed or toilet all day. It has truly been a frightening Friday the 13th.   I can definitively point it to Chipotle s steak  as my wife and I ordered the same thing except the meat  and she was fine. From what I ve researched  this is a growing trend across America and Chipotle can t be trusted in food quality. That was my last time eating at any Chipotle.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,58,Always my go to  fast food.  Fresh produce  responsibly sourced meat and the best iced tea in town. Usually chipotle is a better deal than any other tex-mex options. I wish I could eat it every day 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,59,Good food  great atmosphere. Great place for lunch. You can even get a beer and relax a bit.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,60,Decent food. Decent prices.   Terrible parking lot. Lackluster staff.   Short review for chain restaurants.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,61,Oooh  Chipotle. How you do me right.  Yesterday I rushed in during lunch times to grab a chicken burrito. I m always at odds with Chipotle because if I don t control myself I can down a whole burrito. This is clearly wrong  given their size.   They re very speedy and the food is always fresh and flavorful. Luckily yesterday I had the sense to cut that foil beast in half so as to ensure another proper meal. I don t care if they never remember me. I don t care if it s a chain. I don t care that I am judging myself to the max for even being there. Edited to add  Judgment is not for any former McDonalds affiliations  it s simply for the amount of food they provide and my parents continuing on the traditions of their Depression Era parents who insist upon cleaning one s plate.  I am 100  victim to Chipotle s wiles. You should be  too.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,62,My 8 year old came down with food poisoning after eating at this location. He had a steak burrito with white rice  black beans  guac  sour cream  and cheese. Thankfully  he only ate a small portion of the burrito  but he was very sick within 8 hours.  Fun times.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,63,Excellent  always fresh  good taste  value and what means the most to me is consistency. Love that I can go here everyday for a week while on the road and get something new  different and always be good  burritos are always good  but the grilled chicken tacos  3  are my  current  favorite. Get a flour  two corn  grilled chicken and a beef fajita meat  then change up the toppings and aways surprised at how great the flavors are 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,64,This Chipotle location is in a trendy party of town  and fairly close to my office. It s new  it s clean  it s nice looking. However coming here is a logistics nightmare. The parking is a disaster  there are rarely open spots. There s always a line to the door causing a wait  and it s gotten expensive.   Adding guac to my burrito bowl put the price at an even  9.90. And that s with no drink or sides. That s outrageous to spend  10 for what I consider a fast food lunch  It s not even as if this is healthy food. Carbs  meat  tons and tons of sodium. Sprinkling salty tomatoes and a handful of lettuce on a bowl of rice and beans doesn t make it good for you  -  Just slightly better than the greasy sawdust meals from a drive-thru restaurant. The food is bland. Take away the salt and there really is no flavor. They trick you into think it s hipster-friendly health food while they promote their organic  local-trade image and stamp moral philosophy articles on their take out bags...You re just paying for an idea backed with nothingness.   I might as well go down the street to HEB  pick up a pre-packed sandwich for  4 and be done with it. At least there I can find a parking spot within 400 ft of the doors.  When you get 20 min to grab lunch  the time walking to and from the car adds up   I don t plan on coming back again. I might just be over Chipotle in general.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,65,Fast service and friendly staff. The downfall is this place doesn t have a lot of parking for such a high volume of people. But overall great sevice.   
Chipotle Mexican Grill,66,Got me a chicken burrito and granted that the scoop was I guess smaller than usual  food was still bomb as hell.  Glad I found this location much closer to home than going more outer area.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,67,I honestly gave this place one star because i had to put a star but if it was up to me i would give it a 0  Dont get me wrong i love chipotle and the food is great  I thought this place was great because its 3 minutes away from my job. The only problem is every time i go they give me very small portions of the food and my co-workers say the same thing and when you tell them about it they give you an attitude and thats not good customer service. From now on i try to avoid this place just because of the workers and ive been to several chipotles and this is the only place that dosnt give you a reasnable amount.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,68,My coworker and I ordered our lunch from Chipotle online for delivery.  It was due to be delivered by 11 30.  When I tracked the meal it stated that it was delivered by DoorDash at 11 22.  Door Dash was their delivery provider  not my choice  The food never came.  I called the Chipotle location at Barbara Jordan in Austin to inquire about the delivery.  The food was still sitting in the restaurant at 12 30.  They suggested that I just come pick it up...hello  I ordered delivery for a reason  I was charged the delivery charge and the food was cold and soggy by that time.  The manager  Logan was  not at all helpful. He even spoke the words  and I quote   Ma am  I don t have time to be on the phone with DoorDash to resolve this   He wouldn t help with getting it delivered  refunded or anything.  He referred me to the website and corporate to get my money back.  No refund  no apology  no people skills whatsoever.  If Chipotle is going to contract with DoorDash for delivery services  they need to work with them to rectify any issues.  I ate my lunch from the vending machine today. Chipotle and Door Dash have lost a customer in me.  Lamar J.  door dash delivery person and Logan  manager at this Chipotle location  you have both managed to alienate a repeat customer. I have asked for a refund through the corporate website  since no one would take the time to rectify our issue.  The refund will take two to three days to process and I am going out on a limb to predict that the delivery fee and driver s tip will not be refunded.  I understand that things happen and outside contractors can drop the ball  but if you choose to affiliate your business with a delivery company you need to understand that their issues reflect on your business and more importantly your management people need to step up.  I was polite and understanding right up to the point that he stated that he didn t have time for us.  Seriously   I don t have time or money for Chipotle if that is the best they can do.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,69,This location is painfully slow and don t have the skill of being efficiently speedy. At the location on Bee Caves or Brodie I can go in  order  and be out in less than 5 minutes because they are READY for it. Yes  it might be due to the higher concentration of office workers during the day in SW Austin  but it took me 15-20 minutes to stand in line  not the first time  on a Wed night in Mueller  which was to the door  and from my perception others weren t exactly thrilled either.  My opinion on a fast-food burrito chain where people expect to be in and out  especially at a place like Chipotle where speed is somewhat of an appealing factor... is that it should be fast. Regardless of if it s lunch or dinner or the suburbs or the city. Something I rely on Chipotle for is being able to be in and out when I need good food in a hurry.   This visit made me late to my meeting and even though I stuck it out because honestly  I do really like Chipotle  I was thinking of running over to the restaurants nearby. If a branch of a fast-food chain isn t fast and they re potentially losing business over that  then that s a problem.   To me   this Chipotle is losing its reputation to a more efficient location  and that s coming from someone who visits multiple locations. Maybe for others who aren t regularly pressed for time  then that s not a problem.  A  for the food and the polite staff  but chances are I won t be returning unless I want to wait 20 minutes v. 5 minutes to get my food.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,70,I visit Chipotle at least twice a week.  Today I happened to be near this location and stopped there for my first time the food was good but the serving size I received was the smallest I have ever received at any Chipotle.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,71,I can see how someone living in a city that isn t in Texas might want to eat  a burrito from Chipotle.  They re huge   tasty  and your number of options are not all that limited.  But I live in Austin and can find better  cheaper Mexican food from one of the numerous taquerias that litter the Austin landscape as frequently as churches.  In fact  we could free up a lot of space if we combined the two.  Every church should also house a taqueria and every taqueria should provide spiritual support for at least one faith.    These are the kinds of brilliant plans I come up with daily.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,72,I really enjoy Chipolte and I really enjoy this particular Chipolte.  The staff is really friendly and welcoming  the food is so tasty  the seating  inside and out  is comfortable and nice. The bf and I share bowls and there s always more than enough food for us both.   The ingredients are fresh and pretty darn tasty. I don t feel guilty taking the kids here when I don t feel like cooking.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,73,I like pretty much every Chipotle location  but this one was particularly good.  The store wasn t very busy  so when I arrived  the workers greeted me cheerfully and kept thanking me for coming.  The girl who made my tacos prepared them really well and even offered me rice and beans  which I think usually only come on the burrito.    The prices here  as at other locations  are very fair considering the quality of the food and the quantity you get.  It s about  6 for a burrito  3 soft tacos  4 crispy tacos  or a burrito bol  no tortilla .  The Chipotle meats are lean and tasty  and there are more options than at Freebirds  fajita chicken  fajita beef  carnitas  and barbacoa.  This location doesn t have a ton of seating  but when I went  it wasn t crowded at all and the whole place was immaculately clean.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,74,I m a Freebirds convert  half-birds don t leave me feeling ridiculously full with a quarter burrito waste leftover  but this Chipotle is in the new Mueller shopping center  which is awesome because my husband and I are within biking distance.  They have a nice outdoor patio.  We ve been a couple times.  A few days ago  the cashier kept making jokes a la Stewie Griffin of  Family Guy  to the girl making our burritos  and wouldn t shut up long enough for her to finish our food nor for him to ring it up  which was kind of awkward  but that was an isolated  weird incident.    Orange soda on the fountain   y all 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,75,I ve been to various Chipotle a few times and have been let down each time.   Overpriced  under flavored  limited options. As an example  their only salsa option is Tabasco  albeit three different types.  On the positive side  the ingredients are always fresh.  If you want a burrito  go elsewhere IMO.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,76,New Chipotle location at Mueller.  A couple of notes   - this location is the ONLY food place open over at the Mueller shopping center as of 6 27 07.  This is a master stroke of brilliance for these guys since the Dell Children s hospital just opened and they are less than a block away.   - generally speaking  I don t really like Chipotle that much. They make a serviceable burrito  but for my money I d rather go someplace else.  - however  if someone s buying you lunch and price isn t an issue... then I suggest getting a chicken burrito with the grilled veggies and guacamole. When you re really freaking hungry halfway thru a 10-hour work day  it will actually hit the spot quite nicely  but again - only because I didn t have to pay for it .
Chipotle Mexican Grill,77,You know how some people are either Chipotle people or they re Freebirds people  Count me firmly in the Freebirds camp.   Chipotle just makes a bland  salty burrito. The salsas are okay  but none of them are actually very spicy. Oh  and the salt. Seriously  I like the fact that they re committed to using natural ingredients. I like that this location is new  shiny and open without feeling cold and antiseptic. The staff is always friendly and helpful. You even have tasty Izze drinks  which are delish. Still  every time I come here  I just end up thinking  blecch  that s one salty freakin  burrito.    The worst offender seems to be the cilantro-lime rice. One  you irk me for not offering  fistfuls of fresh cilantro.  Oh  but we have this rice with cilantro in it  doesn t cut it. I want fistfuls of greenery in my burrito  and lettuce is too freakin  bland. Two  it s just a salt-bomb. I can t taste the cilantro for the salt. So  no rice for moi.   C mon  Chipotle. Just because you re technically  fast food  doesn t mean you have to follow all the rules of fast food. You re already breaking quite a few of those rules by sourcing fresh ingredients that d be no stranger in a Whole Foods. Now work on the gottdanged salt.   I just don t feel like Chipotle has enough ingredients to really warrant being an assembly-line joint  either. I guess there s some merit to being able to peek over the counter and tell them how much you want of certain items  but for the most part  meh. There s not enough variety  and there s nothing here that really entices me to come back. Sure  they offer barbacoa  but when there s myriad taquerias to be had that do it SO much better  what s the point    Seriously  guys--explore your local taquerias instead. Before Waco got a Chipotle  we had a Taqueria Arandas  and their giant Super California burrito still kicks the crap out of any Chipotle ever  period  not even a contest.   Overall  this is a very nice location of a very mediocre chain.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,78,oh Chipotle  you got problems other than just the e coli thing at this location.   Of the staff  exactly 2 people were employed  the nice lady working the line  and the checkout lady with the warm smile. Everybody else was so busy discussing their personal stuff I hated to interrupt  particularly the girl blocking the door when I tried to go in as she leaned into an extended shoutout.    There are lots of other Chipotles elsewhere in town--this one s not even convenient to the staff.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,79,What can I say   I m a sucker for the Parmer Metric location.  I used to go there once a week and they knew me there.  Not sure if that mattered or not but the food was always really good.  I came to this location for the first time last week.  It was later in the afternoon and not a lot of people working.  It took a hot minute for anyone to greet me get my order started.  There was literally one person in front of me.  When my order got started I had to repeat  bowl  about 3-5 times because the employee was holding a huge tortilla.  When my bowl finally started getting made  it was made haphazardly.  Ingredients were just thrown in and no thought was given to even distribution.  I know  I know  it s  fast food .  Whatever  it s a peeve of mine.  Also  the ingredients were so skimpy it was as if they were getting rewarded for less waste.  I also found the butt of an onion in my bowl.  It was kind of gross.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,80,Visited September 9th around 1.15 pm  one of the workers the bigger Hispanic woman closer to register at that time gave  me wrong salsa and I could tell  exactly that it was on purpose. The managers need to make sure they get only people with stamina to do standing jobs to work here. She did not have a single one of the thirteen worker qualities you proclaim.  The location is good but the service is average.Some of the staff is grumpy -happens when multiple race and age group  workers work together.No flow. The salsas were considerably less tasty compared to other locations. Are they taking shortcuts  The staff changes in a matter of weeks  hope the new ones are trained better.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,81,As an avid Chipotle customer in Dallas. I felt that this location has poor communication because there are too many people working on the line and it creates clutter. I was extremely appalled that as I was grabbing my credit card to pay  the cashier skipped me and grabbed the lady s card behind me. I felt it was extremely rude because apparently I did not move fast enough for her. I also did not enjoy my food because the chicken was too salty. I am obsessed with chipotle and this experience tainted that for a moment. I will not return to this Austin location.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,82,If you have ever watched the documentary Food Inc. then you can easily comprehend my 5 star review without reading any further.  My 5 star does include the service at this particular Chipotle Grill.    However  for those that have not seen the documentary here is why I like Chipotle.  They serve naturally raised pork  chicken and beef.  Steve Ells founder and CEO of Chipotle is an advocate for eliminating the use of antibiotics in ranching.  Their corporate commitment is to provide customers with  Food with Integrity  visit their website at   a href   redir url http 3A 2F 2Fwww.chipotle.com 2Fen-US 2Ffwi 2Ffwi.aspx amp s 9be05edcc1b4735c2c2036d8d5156f857141309e178a8c2d198a0472b6c8ea79  rel  nofollow  target  _blank  chipotle.com en-US fwi f   a  for more information...  This particular location has a great staff  and they are fairly quick.  I always get the burrito bowl with chicken  steak  black beans  rice  corn  pico  cilantro  guacamole and cheese.  The serving is perfect for me and I normally share it with the BF.  The price is right   If you decided to go during the rush hour you may not find a seat in the dining area  aside from that seats have always been available when I visited this restaurant.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,83,I like Chipotle for its portion size. It s a pretty hearty sized buritto made with fresh ingredients. My portion size tends to be bigger so a sandwich from lets say Wich-Wich right next door does not fill me up at all. The freshness of their ingredients and their flavors are great pluses as well. The service has been pretty consistent here  even with the trainees. This place is starting to become my go-to place for dinner when I don t feel like cooking. The place is also right next to shopping places like Bed Bath  amp  Beyond  Best Buy  Staples  and Home Depot.  The only complaint I have is the price.  7.20 after tax burrito  for carnitas  is almost the price of a sit-in restaurant. But that s generic to all the Chipotle stores.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,84,I went in knowing that it wasn t a Mexican place rather an American-Mexican place. Well I ordered the salad with chicken  brown rice  tomato  and salsa. At the check out I ordered chips. I HATED the food I had to forcibly eat it because I was starving  but boy was it awful. Service was nice. I wont ever come back though  I would rather go to Pad Thai or Smashburger both are in walking distance from this place.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,85,Thank you Chipotle for helping me out when I was starving. It was not yet 11 00 a.m. and you graciously opened your doors to me when you saw the look of hunger on my face as I waited outside for you to open.   All the ladies working at this location are very friendly and fast.  The burritos are tasty enough  especially the barbacoa.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,86,Let me just say that I never enjoyed Chipotle until I came to this one. For some reason  it is special   Great location in the Barbara Jordan Mueller 51st shopping center. And everyone who works here is super nice and friendly. I feel like every time I go in I get a compliment  What an ego boost  which I definitely need  considering all the burritos I m now eating .
Chipotle Mexican Grill,87,Ridiculousness   I ordered the burrito bowl with chicken.  Very  very little chicken.  And the chicken was very fatty and tissue-filled.  I couldn t enjoy the meal without biting down on fatty tissue   With as little meat that s given  you would think it would at least be all meat   Never going back here again   They give you LOTS of rice  sufficient amount of beans a little meat and a little cheese for a BIG price.  So not worth it especially in light of the fact that they are just now getting customers back due to the e.coli 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,88,Great customer service  There was a mix-up with my order and the one behind me  which I didn t notice until I got home. I called and they offered to make me a new one at no charge. When I got there  there was a bit of a line  through I was still in there for no more than five minutes  and everyone in line was given a free drink. These were seriously the nicest Chipotle workers I ve ever interacted with  They went above and beyond in fixing their mistake  and I never once felt I was inconveniencing them. Highly recommend 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,89,This is my favorite location the staff is super friendly the place is always clean and the food is great now with a family of 6 the price isn t all the bad 4 kids meals and 2 adult meals comes out to  30. I could eat chipotle everyday if I lived next to one.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,90,I incredibly appreciate the quality of the food  and the friendly staff.  The portions are plentiful and eating there means a great fresh meal whose taste is really fantastic at an  affordable price. When I either don t have the time or the energy to make my own meals  this is my number one go to restaurant.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,91,This is the only Yelp reveiw I have ever written because this is the first time I have ever been pissed enough to write one. I was giving Chipotle a second chance today  and it failed miserably. The first time I visited  was not a great experience  gave me the runs and it was far inferior to Moe s SouthWest Grill  which has a plenthera of different toppings  chips are free and salsa is unlimited . But they don t really have any Moe s resturants in Austin so I wanted to give Chipotle a second chance. The food was meh at best but the reason I m writing this is because the employees straight up suck. A little old lady behind me spilled water all over the place  the table  her seat  the floor  and her white pants  The lady she was with was visually impared  using a cane to try and make her way to the stand to get napkins. The employees did NOTHING. Didnt help her clean or get napkins or mop up or even put a wet floor sign out. Nothing. They only cleaned up the floor AFTER she left and someone else had to ask them before they did. An employee walked past her THREE TIMES. I was helping her clean up  but just because someone else  a customer  is willing to help doesn t mean you shouldn t step in as an employee to provide minimal service. The visually impared lady with her could have slipped with all the water that was on the floor  she could have gotten seriously hurt if she fell. They seriously need to be retrained or SOMETHING. If for no other reason  to avoid a lawsuit.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,92,This place is great  Your standard Chipotle and very fast at that. I love their antibiotic-free meat and the dressing for their salad is delicious. I m in and out of here in no time  with not much money spent.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,93,This is my favorite Chipotle in Austin. The staff is friendly and very generous with servings. The only downside is its proximity to the Children s Hospital  which can result in extremely busy lunch times  so plan accordingly.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,94,You missed an opportunity Chipotle. I have had people tell me that I need to try your restaurant so I finally did  but I will not be back if it s my choice. I will give you points for having a clean restaurant and smiling faces  but it s going to stop pretty much right there. I could have gotten a better meal somewhere else. All of the smiling servers who I talked to spoke so fast and mumbled that I had ask each one of them to repeat themselves before I could finish my order. The clerk who rang my meal up dropped my change into my hand and it rolled onto the floor. He made an attempt to correct himself by simply saying  sorry   and then looked quickly to the next customer. I sat down with my steak burrito hoping that the steak pieces were going to be as good as I anticipated but I was disappointed. I could have gotten a better meat add a hot dog stand. I ll give you a star because I m not hungry anymore.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,95,This is what you think it is going to be. Its the subway for quasi mexican food. I go once or twice a month and get tacos or salad and have not been disappointed once.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,96,I am a fan of chipotle  and this one was particularly nice mostly because the server gave us giant servings of everything. Quite possibly because it was kinda late at night and just before closing  so obviously they felt generous.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,97,I love Chipotle. I m at this one at least 4 times a month  sometimes more depending on where clients have me going.  Everything is always fresh and tasty  and very consistent.  Food seems to be handled well  and the line moves fast.  This one is a bit smallish inside  but has a nice outside patio area.    They re great when ordering a bunch for the office  too.  Either pass around the fax form  or hit the web page  iPhone app.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,98,I eat here pretty often  its real convenient for me and the food is great  Its never cold  its a clean place  amp  the staff is really friendly 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,99,The staff is very friendly. The food is sooo good and this location always gives very good portions. Even when the place is busy I can get in and out and still make good timing. Chipotle is the best ever and thats a fact.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,100,Ok...so Chipotle called me this week and told me that I won the drawing from the buisness card fishbowl. 10 Free Burritos  I was excited   Then they proceeded to tell me that I had to pick a day and time that wouldnt inconvenience the staff and also I had no choice what was in the burrito but the meat.  I know beggers cant be choosers but really   What about my coworkers who dont like beans or are lactose intolerant   Dont think this is really the way to promote trying Chipotle.  Bad taste in my mouth right now.  I think Freebirds is right around the corner too.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,101,I ordered a margarita with my lunch. It tasted like water with a small bit of lime flavoring. After 1 sip  I asked to get my money back. The cashier  manager   told me that I could not get a refund  but I could choose another drink.  That is ludicrous  I paid for a margarita which cost  4.50 and I didn t want another drink. I ended up with a bottle of water which in effect cost me  4.50.  I am never returning and I will tell my friends. I feel that I was robbed.
Taco Shack,1,Quick place to pick up tacos for breakfast  I had potato and bean this morning  and the tacos were delicious. The tacos stay together well and even once I put the salsa on  they weren t too drippy  so I could eat them in the car without making a mess.
Taco Shack,2,Only had their breakfast tacos. These are good breakfast tacos - not skimpy and flavorful filling. The Shack taco is my personal favorite. Definitely up there in the breakfast taco game.
Taco Shack,3,Best crispy beef tacos in town  If I m craving a crispy taco I m not satisfied unless I go here. Great price also  Can t beat it  The staff is awesome and super friendly   HIT EM UP   You won t be disappointed.
Taco Shack,4,Taco Shack is really good. I think many people assume it s a step down from Taco Deli or Torchy s  but the quality of their food is just as good. Taco Shack is just more old school than those more  hip  taco joints  so you go here when you want more traditional breakfast tacos.  I personally love their breakfast bowls which allow you select from 4 ingredients you want to include. I recommend the ham  amp  black beans.  Taco Shack serves lunch  amp  dinner  but it really shines in the AM for breakfast. Next time you are craving a hearty  delicious breakfast taco then go to Taco Shack.
Taco Shack,5,Messed up my order  amp  didn t want to replace it.  Over  30 worth of food. I m so upset  ridiculous.
Taco Shack,6,Staff behind counter NOT wearing masks and food prep cooks NOT wearing masks. The customer in front of me requested them to wear mask and front staff laughed at her and said no. We left. Staff needs to take this seriously  Have been coming here for years and am extremely disappointed not taking customers safety seriously.
Taco Shack,7,Just got into an actual argument with an employee at this location about weather I ordered flour or corn tortillas. I ve never eaten here it s my first and my last time the employee didn t even remake my food they just moved the taco from flour to corn after I had to explain over and over that I ordered corn tortillas due to a flour allergy. The employee was upset and defensive and completely unprofessional. A sickening thing I see from low class workers is the blatant disrespect they have against clients that have food allergies I get this all over town and it just incentives me to not eat out at trash places like this.
Taco Shack,8,Stopped by for a quick breakfast taco here and while I will say that the speed of the service was impressive  the taco itself was really not. First of all  the ingredients were pretty stuck to the foil when I unwrapped it  so it became pretty messy in the car. Second  the chorizo within the taco just didn t taste great. All that to say  if you find yourself in Austin  TX  you re surrounded by options for breakfast tacos. So this doesn t need to be your first. However  perhaps trying one with bacon or sausage would be worth it.
Taco Shack,9,Taco shack is a snack that does not quite have the knack to crack a 3 star rating. Hope you liked my soundtrack. I ll be releasing it soon  just kidding don t worry  your ears are safe .  It s not bad by any means. In fact  I was pleasantly surprised by the taste of their breakfast tacos. I had the shack taco and the texan taco. The biggest drawback has to be the price given the size. Simple breakfast tacos should not be costing  3.50 or so each. Now don t get me wrong  it tasted fine  but at the end of the day  I was wishing I had by  7 back to buy a bigger and more satisfying meal.  I wouldn t mind coming back if they lowered their prices  but I don t that ll happen anytime soon. In the meantime go to taco joint instead for a better tasting and better bargain of a taco.
Taco Shack,10, 7.47  for two tacos with eggs      Yeah this is very poor quality food I ordered the Texan taco the way how they prepare the taco is just drop egg few slices of old taste beef and that s it they not even mix the egg with the meat because everything is prepared long time ago. Thats why is not fresh  second taco . shack taco  the chorizo was old and dry. The egg same thing just drop the egg and they put the chorizo on top and ready.  Don t want to comeback to any of this restaurant for this bad experience   Cashier not helpful  I ask the cashier are both menus are same    He said yes  after I ordered I noticed that the other menu was different. But well. Is over
Taco Shack,11,Cute little stop on the way downtown.really yummy and pretty quick service nice to sit down and look on ongoing traffic
Taco Shack,12,This morning I had an awful enough experience that I am motivated to write this review immediately.  Here is the short version   The young man working the order window was unfriendly.  He compounded his unfriendliness with incompetence.  As a result  today was my last visit to Taco Shack  which makes me sad  because I ve been a customer going all the way back to the original shack.  For the curious reader who wants to indulge my venting  here are the details   I placed my order for four tacos.   Lest you think me a pig  two were for a friend.   There was apparently a breakdown in communication because the pickup window announced there were six tacos ready for me.  Now let s stop right here.  Suppose the communication error that resulted in this mistake was the fault of the young man who took my order.  He should fix that mistake and my order.  Now suppose the communication error was my fault.  Okay  but I m the customer  right   The solution is the same   Fix the mistake by correcting my order.  The young man and I had fruitless discussion about the cause of the mistake  he was firm in his conviction that I was the culprit  and instead of fixing the mistake he suggested that I was two tacos ahead and should be pleased.  I was not.  But rather than waste any more time on a Sunday morning I took the bag of six tacos because the young order-taker went out of his way to point out that  my  four tacos were among the six.  Fine.  I just want to get out of this thunderstorm and eat my tacos at home.  I didn t even seek a refund for the two tacos I didn t order.  Here s the punchline   Two of the four  correct  tacos were not the correct tacos.  So of the the six tacos in my bag  a mere one-third were correct.  That s a score of 33 .  Fail.
Taco Shack,13,I love this restaurant  with a few caveats. The burnet road burrito is amazing. I have recently been a fan of their breakfast bowl  which is both cheap and very tasty. My biggest problem with taco shack is their lack of variation. The only vegetable they have on their menu is pico  which is great  but I would love some other options. Mushrooms  onions  spinach. Anything  Please please add vegetables to your menu      Also  I think you would get a lot more customers if you cooked fresh eggs on the grill 
Taco Shack,14,Space        Not sure how you rate a shack. It s not trying to be anything fancy. It s no frills with a window to order and a window to pick up. There s some shades seating around the side and a few parking spots in front.   Food  4 5 the tacos were tasty and definitely stuffed full. The Texan taco had a really hearty portion of well seasoned steak. I would say the potatoes in the Shack taco were a little tried out.
Taco Shack,15,I was recently at their location on Guadalupe St. and while I waiting for my food  I noticed that the employees were not wearing gloves or masks. The employee preparing my food stuck her bare hand into a bag of cheese. During times like these  spread of COVID-19  it is unacceptable for a restaurant to remain open and not take any safety precautions to prevent the spread of the virus. Although I did receive a refund for my order  I am more concerned about the health of other customers.
Taco Shack,16,Have been here a few times for coffee only  which is very good. First stop today for food and was pleasantly surprised by their veggie crumble. I ll be back 
Taco Shack,17,I didn t really have any high expectations to let down  but it did waste a moment for good breakfast tacos. This place is really easy to drive by and not give a second look  and it s pretty much the same for their food-although I am surprised it was pretty busy when I went.   To be fair  it isn t as sketchy as it looks from the street  but I would suggest a more open more inviting look for publicity. The parking situation is a mess  and frankly  my roommate and I never figured it out.   For the important stuff  FOOD. Underwhelming...It tastes exactly like a generic breakfast taco. I got a potato  egg   amp  cheese and a chorizo  bean  amp  bacon  but instead of satiating my craving  it felt more like eating to put food in my stomach than a party in my mouth. The POTATO  EGG  amp  CHEESE was bland but with a buttload of salsa  it was alright. The CHORIZO  BEAN   amp  BACON was decent  but it s relatively hard to mess up.   Overall  I could come back if I was desperate and lazy  but there are a lot of better places.
Taco Shack,18,No frills taco shack  just as described. The Texan has a great portion of steak. May recommend one big taco with all add on vs two tacos  if you are biking like I was . Also had a bacon  egg  potato  cheese and was substantial.   Great quick pick up  friendly staff. Small salsa containers so ask for extra
Taco Shack,19,I stop at Taco Shack every once in awhile and all is fine. I stopped by recently and that quickly changed. I ordered a sausage  egg  and cheese taco and noticed after leaving upon opening it that there was a hair in it. I haven t gone back yet and I m not sure that I ever will.
Taco Shack,20,This place SLAPSSSS     It is sooooo good. There s always the same guy there and we re homies now. Burritos can be a little expensive but I m a broke ass bitch that won t drop  1 on a bottle of water so who am I to say something is expensive. I recommend the Burnet Road Burrito w  beans. I ve gained something like 10 pounds from this place but it s worth it.
Taco Shack,21,This is my FAVORITE breakfast taco place    however I do wish it was a little cheaper because two tacos is like  8 and as a college student I can t really afford that so I have to limit how often I come.  But if they were a little cheaper I d be there every morning   Or maybe they should have like a punch card or something for loyal people. However it s my friends and i s favorite go to spot  
Taco Shack,22,2 stars because Taco Cabana makes better tortillas. Ordered sweet tea the cashier heard me because she asked if I wanted small or large. I paid for large only to find out they don t carry sweet tea. Of course it was too much trouble to return my  2.19 so I won t be returning at all. There are way better places to get a taco than this  hit  hack. Goo luck
Taco Shack,23,I like breakfast tacos....a lot. In fact  if it wasn t for cholesterol ramifications  I d eat them every day. But Taco Shack just doesn t cut it  especially with Torchy s breakfast tacos less than a block away. I find it weird I live right outside this place but never ventured there until today.  We got the shack pack  potato and egg and bacon and egg tacos. The thing to like is that they do give you a full strip of bacon  which looks impressive but thats the end of the line really. It doesn t have much taste and the eggs are kinda pebbly. Tortilla seemed like one of those generic cheap ones you find from the Mission bags. The taco itself isn t that large either.  At the end of the day you get what you would expect from a place called taco shack. Tacos sold out of a very unappealing sounding place that unfortunately leaves you underwhelmed instead of surprised.
Taco Shack,24,I am still in shock that I paid  2.50 for a breakfast taco and it was the tiniest taco I have ever seen in my entire life. The eggs were watery and bland  potatoes as well  and the bacon tasted like it had been sitting under a heat lamp for days.   No amount of pepper or salt or salsa could make that crappy taco any better. What is all the darn hype  
Taco Shack,25,Um  no. Just...no. First of all  good luck trying to find parking. There are two spots. But maybe you ll get lucky and there won t be any parking and you ll keep on driving. Seriously  it s the best thing you can do for yourself. Keep going. Pass this shack and don t look twice.   Horrible breakfast tacos. Just...ick. Cold eggs  gross chorizo  hard potatoes and mediocre salsa. Oh  and I went to get a diet coke and a bee fell out of the soda machine  so there s that.  Seriously  there are WAY better places for much  much cheaper.
Taco Shack,26,Taco shack breakfast tacos are the best and oh how dearly I miss them now that we don t live near one of their locations.  I definitely took them for granted when we lived near the Metric location years ago.  Now we live in a part of town barren of their delicious wares so I only indulge when I happen to be near one.  That doesn t happen too often  but this past weekend my wife and I were at Seton for the birth or our second child.  And being that we spent two nights at the hospital  it was naturally a top priority of mine to fit some Taco Shack tacos into the mix.  You all know what I mean  don t act like you don t.  I mean  their potato  egg  and cheese tacos make for a pretty perfect breakfast.  Other factors that sealed the deal on two straight mornings of Taco Shack goodness  1   We were literally just 5 minutes from two locations 2   One of them  this one  was open on Sundays 3   Nursing mothers should always stay properly nourished with eggs and plenty of cheese
Taco Shack,27,Taco Shack is not really a place that I would go out of my way for on a workday when I am running late  but I do enjoy rolling out of bed at 10 on a Sunday and grabbing one. They have breakfast all day on the weekends so I take my time waking up. The food is good and it comes out quick.  A lot of people complain about the parking  but what do you want.. they are located in the corner of a gas station lot. Most of the people who frequent there  grab tacos and leave. The parking spots clear up quickly.  If anything  I rate these people highly because they are consistent. When I order bacon egg cheese or potato egg cheese  I get the tacos well wrapped and hot and they always include a little salsa cup for each taco. They never forget napkins either. Grab and go.
Taco Shack,28,When I worked within walking distance we ate here often. It is also a cheap place to eat while spending all your   shopping on the drag.  I respect the fact that it is a family run Austin only chain.  The wife of the owner has a delicious chicken soup named in her honor I forget the name but it is very yummy - try it.  The breakfast tacos  till 11 AM I think  are 1.49 with 2 fillings and choice of tortilla. My stand by is the corn w  egg  potato and cheese the additional add on is .35. 1 taco for me is a light breakfast or an early pre-lunch snack while shopping. 2 breakfast tacos before 11AM and I won t need food till Happy Hour.  For lunch I like the Chalupa and the Quesadilla  I love that they let you choose your tortilla as I do not like flour and that is how they usually come- here I get 1 corn w  beans and cheese  both are 1.49. I can easily fill up on 2 or 3 of these for less than 5 bucks.   Don t go here looking for ambiance its just as bad as the closest taco at Taco Smell but the food is way better.  If you are ever up North the location on Metric   Parmer has a lovely outdoor garden seating with a water fountain.  Nowhere near the best taco in Austin  but  the best for the cheap in this area.  PS Last time I was here they close at 2 30PM
Taco Shack,29,I stopped here to get breakfast after picking up some hardware at Breed s before heading into the lab.  Fast  polite service  good tacos.  I got a  Shack pack  which is 6 tacos  3 potato  amp  egg  3 bacon  amp  egg  for my co-worker and I.  A bag of tacos and 2 orange juices for  10.  Eggs were hot  amp  fresh and the potatoes perfect  salsa was tasty.  I watched through the window while they were making the tacos.  It s tiny  but clean  and watching the 4 people working in there was like ballet.  Four stars for it being what it is  and pretty darn good at it.    Something must have changed since those mediocre 2007 reviews were written  other than the minimal parking   since it seemed much better to me than many of those older reviews would suggest.
Taco Shack,30,Greasy  dirty  nasty tacos done right.  Yummy.    Okay so the place REALLY is a shack  it has no indoor anything really and the hours are strange at best.  Still the place is a great choice if you are looking for just plain dirty tacos with no regards for health or trying to find something gourmet.    Taco Shack is a convenient stop for those shopping the North end of the drag.  The food is reasonably priced for what you get and certainly better than going to the nearby Taco Bell.  They load up the tacos with all kinds of goodness but that doesn t overcome the fact that nothing really makes them memorable or makes them stand out above any other cheap taco joint.    Overall  expect cheap prices  quick service  big fatty tacos and a future colon cleansing.  If you re in a hurry or just need some walking shopping food try the shack.  If you have time to sit down try Milto s or Spider House both are nearby and offer better grub.
Taco Shack,31,Good cheap tacos. Their plain tacos are similar to T-Bell but with higher-quality ingredients. Salsa is very good--I was pleasantly surprised. 2 decent tacos for under  3  I m always down for that...
Taco Shack,32,Breakfast tacos are an essential part of my daily nutrition  ha. I wanted to like Taco Shack. The name  the idea seemed right up my alley. I dealt with the dicey parking situation  had to figure out which window was the ordering window and eventually had breakfast tacos for the family. I thought I had scored something good   But the tortillas  There is a problem. You see  the tortillas are the same as the kind sold in bags in supermarkets. These are not even those made fresh by the tortilla machine at the Hancock Center HEB. These are the thick  chewy ones that were made in a factory somewhere. If only Taco Shack and other Austin places would have ladies making homemade tortillas fresh  the food here would be so much better and authentic. Before you think that I am asking for too much  go to the Valley  to almost any convenience store  and you will see tortillas being made before your eyes  then filled while still fresh and hot  for a delicious taco that costs 99 cents. And don t forget the fresh  really fresh salsa that has never seen a can of tomato sauce. Maybe the owners of Taco Shack should take a little trip south to see what breakfast tacos should and could be 
Taco Shack,33,I have fond memories of when this actually looked like a shack. I used to work at the donut shop across the street and we would often brter donuts for tacos and they would hook us up. I can still find this great attitude there.  However  this is not a place for vegetarians  If you like to eat meat in a mexican inspired fancy  go here it s cheap  Fast fuel for fast times. Limited offerings on the menu make this one a great place for illiterate folks or stoners. What else can I say  cheap and descent make this a visit if you want.
Taco Shack,34,Delicious breakfast tacos. Don t expect real Mexican flavor though. Their salsa is the only thing that could be considered to taste Mexican. It s hard to find good salsa at a taco place in the US.  4 5  would eat here again.  They don t open at 6am as their website says though. I ve made the mistake of going there at 6am and waiitng for half an hour. 6 30 is their real opening time. Enjoy.
Taco Shack,35,Oh yes.  Definitely a contender for the best breakfast tacos in the city.  I miss you  Taco Shack.
Taco Shack,36,I went to order a chicken quesadilla and got a quesadilla with  yes  RAW chicken. I contacted the manager and he said they were gonna fix it. The guy from the store told me he would PERSONALLY deliver it to me  I work right across the street . He never did. Oops  Don t mind me reporting you to the health department   I am going to . This is unacceptable  dangerous to sell raw chicken and super unsanitary.   Love   The Girl Who You Never Delivered The Quesadilla To
Taco Shack,37,update 1 12 2007 Alright  I ll give these guys a little more credit than I did in my original review.  They ve had some new guys come in and take over  and things run much more smoothly than before.  But for F s sake  how could a taco place not be open on Sunday morning   Its about the same price as other places  the tacos are not any larger or particularly better than anyone else  but they do stand out from the crowd in one respect   they are never open.  The one on Spicewood Springs isn t even open on Sundays.
Taco Shack,38,Quick lunch or breakfast  and I usually get out of there for around 5 or 6 bucks.   The flavors won t take you to utopia like some of my other favorite spots  but they make my taste buds do the electric-slide  and thats good enough for me 
Taco Shack,39,only 3 things i expected from this place. fast  cheap  and good. Met all 3. Burnet Road burrito is where its at  used to get it once a week.
Taco Shack,40,Eggs from a bottle  Come on Taco Shack. Considering how many local competitors you have  how could you think that was ok  I had the  Burnet Road Burrito . For 5 bucks  it s not worth it. The bacon had a rubber feel. The eggs were straight out of a bottle. I watched the guy pour it into the pan. The tortilla wouldn t compare to an HEB tortilla. It s unfortunate that with such a prime guad location you would have such low standards.
Taco Shack,41,Honestly not the best breakfast tacos I ve had. I only like this place because of the location and seating. Service is fast and it s coveniently located on Guadalupe in front of spider house and across the street from juiceland. They let you make your own tacos and the prices aren t bad though.  Breakfast all day.
Taco Shack,42,This place has been a favorite of mine for a long time. If I am going out for breakfast  chances are I m going here. The tacos are quickly made  and taste great. In especially love the salsa. I do wish they had a larger menu though  maybe with burritos or enchiladas for lunch.
Taco Shack,43,The Tacos here are mediocre... Not impressed and the main reason is because they make their tacos with store bought tortillas..  Coming from San Antonio I m picky about my tacos and if the word taco is in the name of your restaurant then I think you should at the least have homemade tortillas.  Taco Shack step it up and start making your own tortillas...
Taco Shack,44,I stop here often to pick up a breakfast taco on my way to work  and they are fresh and quick and a decent size  if however a bit on the plain side  but they still hit the spot.  Their salsa is not my favorite  but it ll do.   I would give them an extra star if they just had a spicy option.
Taco Shack,45,i LOVE the breakfast tacos. mostly because the potatoes are so good and crispy  like frenchfries but breakfast potatoes. so cheap also
Taco Shack,46,Taco Shack is locally owned by Orando and Yoli  a couple of former school teachers.  They make some of the best straight up  nothing fancy  breakfast tacos in town.  The best for me is the  Shack  with chorizo  potato  egg and cheese.  Add sliced avocado and put it on a corn tortilla  then be sure to get some pico de gallo instead of the salsa.  It s an awesome meal  you won t need lunch.  For those of you who complained about the location on Spicewood Springs  it s the only location that Orlando doesn t own outright  it s another group and they run theirs a little differently.  Try the one downtown on 402 Brazos  back side of the Frost Bank building   it s small  but they do a great job.  Also  Taco Shack gives back to the community in a big way.  They sponsor the  Taco Shack Bowl  between McCallum and Anderson high schools to raise money for scholarships and the Capital Area Food Bank.
Taco Shack,47,One of my favorite weekend breakfast taco spots. The Shack taco is pure joy  the service is fast  and the place is perfectly funky.
Taco Shack,48,By far the best breakfast tacos  And if you disagree that you haven t tried the Shack Taco      Love love love taco shack
Taco Shack,49,My wife is addicted to going to Taco Shack  which means from time to time  I go to Taco Shack.  If you business is built on the scrambled egg  I would hope you could figure out that eggs like a little salt and pepper.  Here s some free advice  eggs also like to be completely cooked.  The cardinal sin committed by Taco Shack is found in their red salsa.  Horseradish   Horseradish   Horseradish   Are you kidding me   The green salsa is above average  but still...   Horseradish   Channeling Allen Iverson here.   Whose idea was it to put horseradish in the salsa   The Burnet Road Burrito has been pretty good.  I like their iced tea.  The price and location save this place from 1-star land.  You can fill up for cheap  but unless you re in a rush  why would you 
Taco Shack,50,I love the breakfast tacos at all of the Taco Shack locations. However  the Guadaloupe  amp  29th location NEVER opens on time in the morning. When minutes count in the morning  because I have to show up at MY job on time  it can be frustrating waiting for them to get their collective act together and open.
Taco Shack,51,Good  cheap  fast tacos at a convenient location  but they are a bit ordinary.  Hours are a bit inconvenient  as you can t come here for a late night bite.  The tacos are served with nothing special  and the meat is a tad greasy.  They don t offer corn tortillas  which isn t too good in my book  but for the price you pay  these tacos are definitely a great fallback.
Taco Shack,52,Good stuff  Amy and I stopped here on our way to the Texas State History Museum. Great little joint with fresh good ingredients  loved sitting out on the porch watching everyone wake up from a night of partying. Gritty and full of character  just like I like  em 
Taco Shack,53,A co-worker and i stopped here for lunch today. I ve gone to the north store for breakfast and it was good-nothing special. Today i am thoroughly disappointed. The rice tastes like straight up tomatoes  the beans are canned and not even seasoned  and the sandwich...ugh. They forgot my guac  which they charged me for  and the sanwich is cut all the way through  not on an angle so i can t even pick it up without half of it falling apart. The lettuce is brown and looks like it sat in the fridge overnight near the freezer  and the sour cream is plopped onto the side of the sandwich and not even spread out. Did i mention my bun is STALE  I hate stale bread  crackers  etc. If i wasn t so hungry i would have taken it back and gotten my money refunded. They charged my co-worker a DOLLAR per taco for CHEESE. Unbelievable. I get covering food costs  but haven t the owners read about nickle and diming your customers  If not  they should.  I will not be returning  ever.
Taco Shack,54,OMG  Their burritos are the size of a mack truck    Seriously one is equal to 3 square meals and soooooo darn good   Plus the food is prepared super fast and the service is just as friendly.  The only thing I guess I could complain about is the line at the window -- but then again isn t a line the sign of a prosperous business   Oh and the mack truck burrito is only about 5 bucks    Muy  Bueno  
Taco Shack,55,Nothing flashy about this place other than how good their breakfast tacos are. Plain old Bacon and Egg is great  or try the Shack Taco.
Taco Shack,56,not good at all  they need to know more about mex food since their food doesn t tatse like it...
Taqueria los Regios,1,My new favorite taco truck  Got the al pastor street tacos  5 for  12-13. Very flavorful with amazing salsa  don t forget the salsa    Located in front of the Sunoco right outside of Q2 Stadium.
Taqueria los Regios,2,I think they must have had an off night.  I ordered the  I ve never been here before special  delivered by doordash.  He s what I got for  17 before paying any doordash fees etc.  I tried each of these  and while it wasn t terrible it certainly wasn t anything special.
Taqueria los Regios,3,OMG talk about delish tacos    The carnitas were extremely good and sirloin  al pastor even better. We ate so fast we have no pictures of our food  but needles to say... 100  recommended
Taqueria los Regios,4,LOVE this taco truck. It s in an unassuming location at the Sunoco gas station on Braker Lane. It is the YELLOW truck that is in the lineup of food trucks closest to the road  not next to the Sunoco gas station mart . They serve both breakfast and dinner tacos. Be sure to check Google for the times they are open. The schedule on Yelp seems to be out-of-date.  Unfortunately I haven t had a chance to try their breakfast tacos yet  but I have been able to sample several of their non-breakfast offerings. For the tacos  the tortillas have pre-melted cheese on them  so they are kind of greasy and cheesy and extra flavorful. The meat is always on point for both flavor and texture  and they do not skimp on portion size. Both the red and green salsas are excellent.  Service is super fast. You won t have to wait long for your appetite to be quenched.  Prices are very reasonable. I don t know why anyone would anywhere else for tacos in the area. These are simply fantastic  and cheap. You can t go wrong.  I ve also had a few chats with the owners there. They take a lot of pride in their business and are super friendly. No issues speaking English either.
Taqueria los Regios,5,Perfect taco truck haul   15 for 4 tacos  Greasy so make sure to pack a fistful of napkins.
Taqueria los Regios,6,Omg omg omg  This food truck is amazing. I had the nunca he venido  9 which was fried tacos and fried quesadillas they were so good the green sauce was amazing and spicy  My wife got three tacos with flour tortillas. The tortillas were great but the Al pastor and bistec were nothing special. However  there Barbacoa  was sensational  a must get 
Taqueria los Regios,7,Holy smokes. I can t say enough good things. We got the tacos doraditos and the street tacos with pastor and everything was incredible. If you re looking for anything before or after an Austin FC game or any other time they re open I would highly recommend.
Taqueria los Regios,8,Delicious and super authentic  The empalmes are my favorite. Also wonderful staff and service
Taqueria los Regios,9,This is literally the first taco truck in Austin that makes me feel like I am in Mexcio  The food is good and the staff is friendly. If you haven t been  highly recommended.
Taqueria los Regios,10,Amazing food  I love the Tlaquepaque ba ados  authentic street tacos    Come and try the most amazing Mexican food
Taqueria los Regios,11,Great Mexican food truck  Authentic flavors of tacos and food from around Monterey Nuevo Le n. Awesome lean barbacoa  Goes great in any of their fixings. I went for their official grand opening and because it was my first time  I decided to try their written daily special  Nunca he venido . It means  never been here .     It might become a staple due to popularity. The owner and his family are super nice and friendly. It s definitely a family operation. The food was delicious. Some stuff was spicy  but not taste killer. The tacos de vapor  or canasta  were delicious and tasted like a tamal taco and not greasy whatsoever. Very tasty  The Empalme  kind of a quesadilla with beans dipped in a red sauce   was delicious  but I used a lot of napkins by the time I finished that one  Maybe a fork and knife could help that one out  Didn t get to try their breakfast menu  but I m sure it s gotta be just as good as the grub we had for lunch. I was too full to try anything else and seriously wanted to try menudo from the other truck nearby at first  LoL  This food truck is in a gas station parking lot and it gets full at lunch time  and in the weekends it s got both the stadium construction workers and locals. The great thing though is that there are a total of 5 good trucks in the parking lot so you have plenty of good authentic choices.
Taqueria los Regios,12,I tried this place for the first time today.  I couldn t get item I wanted or drink.  I should have left from there.  I ordered the barbacoa tacos and I felt like I should have my arteries cleaned after one.  The taste was bland.  Plus the lack of cleanliness and sanitation is shocking.
Taqueria los Regios,13,Wow this place is as amazing   Tacos were amazing and so quick  We will be back  The owner was here and was telling us his story  Amazing Resturant and throughly enjoyed the tacos 
Taqueria San Luis,1,Went to trailer located on airport and 38th.  Maybe it s moved or maybe there are two...  I have a system for testing taco trucks           1 al pastor taco with corn tortilla.  This al pastor taco blew my hair back.  It was so good.  Perfectly seasoned  crispy pork and fresh onions and cilantro with a freshly made verde sauce.  And the star of the show is the homemade tortilla.  Wow    
Taqueria San Luis,2,I came here recommended by a coworker. Was not disappointed. They make their tortillas to order which is great. I had the corn tortillas I really liked the flavor. Warning  they tend to get soggy easier than flour  but I prefer corn tortillas over flour that s just my preference. Meat was very well seasoned and had good flavor.  Idk why people are saying not much seasoning  some people have different palettes  They had a green sauce and red sauce  the red sauce is the spiciest. It had good spice and added more flavor. Will come back here again to try a lunch plate.
Taqueria San Luis,3,Hesitant to have this place blow up  but the only thing worse would be if they go away  So I m writing a rare review so I can continue enjoying this east side taco gem forever.  DAMN. These tacos are seriously amazing  most notably due to the homemade tortillas. I get corn tortillas for tacos  and normally that means your taco is falling apart halfway through. Not here. This tortilla is literally 3mm thick and hot off the press.  I ve been a taco deli loyalist for years  but this is a completely different level. It s authentic. You order from an abuela and the salsa comes in little packets made from plastic baggies.   SO bomb. Please do yourself a favor and eat here - Get the chorizo for breakfast 
Taqueria San Luis,4,Nice people  ok prices  lacks flavor.  Super bland.  I think if they added some spices it would help.  The salsa even was not that great.  It reminded me of school lunch salsa.
Taqueria San Luis,5,I am not the harshest breakfast taco critic but I am looking for homemade tortillas and gobs of yellow cheese and this is exactly what it is. Try it or order from Uber Eats so you don t have to deal w Austins s traffic and parking.  Oh yeah  the red Salsa is hot as balls beware when pouring on your entire taco.
Taqueria San Luis,6,Ordered a beef and chicken fajita plate through uber eats. The plates are well portioned and reading the reviews I had high expectations. Unfortunately  the food was lacking in flavor and overall was a disappointment. The beef and chicken fajitas tasted almost unseasoned. The homemade tortillas looked delicious but were also bland. The salsas were spicy but aside from that didn t really have any flavor.
Taqueria San Luis,7,Amazing tacos  Homemade corn tortillas. So fresh  so much flavor. I ll be dreaming of these for dayyyys.
Taqueria San Luis,8,Great salsa  great tacos  great prices  Only thing is the cashier doesn t speak english  but she is super sweet.
Taqueria San Luis,9,It is all about the homemade corn tortillas  Fillings were all tasty and well seasoned too. I had 3 types  al pastor  chicken and napoles- all delicious.
Taqueria San Luis,10,Pastor tacos with homemade corn tortillas.  They were great  going back as soon as I can 
Taqueria San Luis,11,Fantastic Barbacoa and al pastor Pork tacos. Lovely ladies serving up great tacos with homemade corn tortillas. Hidden gem in East Austin in the little food truck lot where Pleasant Valley meets E. 1st Street.
Texas Sushiko,1,Best sushi in Austin and it s out of a food truck    Chef Michael is a genius and super friendly to walk me through all the special sushi tacos of the day.   On the cheap side I was shocked at how good both the salmon skin and spam rolls were.  On the expensive end the crab was mind blowing.
Texas Sushiko,2,One of the best handrolls we ve had in Austin so far  This food truck is located at the most perfect location. You can get some sake at the distillery right in front to pair with your handrolls  - perfect for the hot weather    All of the handrolls we had were very fresh and delicious. Our favorites were the kingcrab and tuna handrolls. The kingcrab was super buttery and yummy  i mean who doesnt love melted butter    . My bf also liked the spam handroll as well. These were all so good we went back in line for seconds   Overall  i thought they did a really good job with pairing the seasoning with the fish proteins. We will definitely be back to get a our quick handroll fix again soon 
Texas Sushiko,3,How is it possible for someone to not give Texas Sushiko 5 stars     I ve been dining at Texas Sushiko at Texas Sake for months now  and since my first bite it instantly became my favorite sushi joint in town.  This may be the most epic unknown sushi joint in the country right now because they re doing truly incredible omakase style bites at a price every sushi lover can afford.    From their spam roll to their wagyu roll you cannot go wrong.  Just writing this review makes me want to go in when they open.
Texas Sushiko,4,This truck is one of the best kept secrets in Austin. As someone that has worked for Chef Morimoto himself  the handrolls are nothing short of amazing. Words cannot describe how good this place is. Go  Run  Leave your home or job immediately and grab the tasty creations they have to offer. No option is bad. This truck deserves its own restaurant. You make me dream of moving to Austin to always be closer to you.
Texas Sushiko,5,This is a cool food handroll truck spot with a sake bar right next to it  I know what you re thinking  sushi out of a food truck   Here me out... it was really good   I came here on a Friday night and although the parking is big  it here was ALOT of people out at this area that made it a little difficult to find parking for. We got a variety of hand rolls but hands down I think the best one was the hamachi. All the rolls were fresh and delicious but the hamachi just hit a little differently. It is a little pricey but I would say that it was totally worth it  
Texas Sushiko,6,This place is a food truck located in a park full of bars and eateries. The sushi tacos are so good  I ordered the spam  scallop  salmon  and tuna. The yuzu sauce on the salmon is especially great 
Texas Sushiko,7,Presentation was great  but the food was expensive for what you get. We ordered the salmon  hamachi  salmon skin and corn ribs. The corn ribs were great  the sushi rice had too much vinegar and the flavors were just ok. I wanted to really like this place as we were excited to try it but we much rather the hand rolls at uroko
Texas Sushiko,8,Seriously my favorite place I ve eaten at in Austin so far. Texas Sushiko is so underrated. The corn ribs are very unique in the best way. You can get your food brought inside to Texas Sake  their partner company  where we had a delicious sake margarita.
Texas Sushiko,9,I love the location and the concept. I got the corn  king crab and sea scallops. Corn and king crab were yummy  sea scallops was okay. It was an expensive meal  but I would go back to try some more things.
Texas Sushiko,10,This might be my new favorite sushi spot in Austin  and to make it even better you get to eat it at sake bar 
Texas Sushiko,11,High quality sushi and Austin craft sake. It s located in the yard where you can find craft wine  whisky  and sake   
Texas Sushiko,12,By far the best sushi ever  So glad we found this gem. My bff and I had a great time with both sake and sushi. The staff was super friendly and offered some great recommendations. If you re in Austin  this is a must try eatery    Can t wait to go back 
Texas Sushiko,13,This place is delicious   I had a blue fin tuna roll and my friend had a the king crab roll and we both tried the scallop roll as well.  One of my FAV sushi places now  and the ambience makes it even better.  Everyone at the food truck serving us was extremely nice and social and it made for an overall great experience.  Highly recommend trying this place 
Texas Sushiko,14,Shit is bomb af. Corn riblets  spam hand roll and scallop hand roll. Yep. I mean all the hand rolls are good. Don t skip this place.
Texas Sushiko,15,Honestly  presentation was pretty  it looked great. But the first bite i took it was so sour. There is so much vinegar in the rice that it masked the taste of everything. I ended up just eating the topping and not even eating the rice. Disappointed. The only thing good was the corn ribs because there wasn t any rice in it. Definitely have potential if they changed the rice recipe they use.
Pueblo Viejo Meanwhile,1,Went there on the Labor Day  thanks for being open  Pueblo Viejo . Long line  but it moved pretty fast   I ordered my usual favorite  Taco Bueno and Taco Nes. Both were delicious  consistent as other locations I ve tried. Their ghost habanero salsa elevated my tacos to next level.  When your order is ready  they texted you so people don t need to hover around the trucks. Appreciate that since it s hot out   Pueblo Viejo is still my favorite taco place in Austin.
Pueblo Viejo Meanwhile,2,I got the specialty taco plate with the quesadilla steak taco and steak and chorizo taco. Both tacos  beans rice and chips were great.
Pueblo Viejo Meanwhile,3,I love tacos and I also love Pueblo Viejo  This food truck is parked at the Meanwhile Brewery and is a happening place to be in Southeast Austin. I ve had Pueblo Viejo at different locations through the city over the last 10 years so and I was delighted to see them pop up at Meanwhile. Lately I m loving the Quesadilla tacos and chips and queso. It s been my go to order for several weeks now. They are open early for breakfast tacos as well  which I d recommend trying. Their selection of hot sauces is impressive too. If tacos aren t your thing  no worries  they offer all kinds of other Tex Mex plates to choose from and it s all good  You can t go wrong with Pueblo Viejo especially when you re re chilling at Meanwhile sipping on a beer and watching you kids play on the playground 
Pueblo Viejo Meanwhile,4,These tacos were phenomenal. I had the Al Pastor and Taco Nes. Both were delicious. I got the creamy serrano and Mexican chipotle sauce with them  which just added to the deliciousness. The menu is huge here  so definitely a place where you can try something new here each time.
Pueblo Viejo Meanwhile,5,I want to start out by saying that I am most definitely a huge fan of Pueblo Viejo as a brand - great food and pricing.  However  the location at Meanwhile Brewing left me with an unpleasant experience due to the lack of customer service.    I ve visited twice - first time service was great  food was hot and consistent with other locations.  Second visit - I was completely ignored by the staff.  When I attempted to make an order  the staff member sitting in front of the window completely ignored me.  I never want to be the person to bang on a food truck window  so I just stood there waiting  nothing.  I said  Hello  are you open    Ignored.  Hello     Feeling awkward  I checked their truck signage to make sure they were open  they were.  I checked online - also marked open.  Great  guess I ll go to the neighboring food trucks who actually serve customers.  Unfortunate experience. Would give one star  but added a second in good faith that this was a one off thing.
Pueblo Viejo Meanwhile,6,My wife and I were in Austin for a long weekend and i ordered the fish tacos and al pastor taco. The fish taco was one of the best grilled fish tacos I have ever had. It was ready in about 5 minutes but their salsas were weird. They were more like dressings instead of salsa.   The ghost was spicy  but not crazy hot and I like the jalapeno.  The chips and guac looked great as well. I didn t try them  but it looked fantastic   The atmosphere of the brewery was wonderful and during COVID  the outdoor seating was huge. Dog friendly and super nice people serving the beer.  Totally try this place 
Pueblo Viejo Meanwhile,7,Pueblo Viejo is my go to stop when I want to spice up my breakfast taco routine.   They have an amazing salsa selection. The orange  I assume habanero sauce is great. The smokey black sauce they give is great. Really all the salsas here are great.   I made a really complex breakfast taco order  all special tacos  all different toppings. I was sure there would be some mistakes. Guess what  they nailed it 100 .   If you want something a little nicer than your average taco truck and great service. Pueblo Viejo is for you.
Pueblo Viejo Meanwhile,8,I blame the beer for not having photos. However  I wish I lived in austin so I could come back here every weekend  Holy smokes  I had the burrito and it was the best I ve ever had  Idk what they did. But THEY DID IT 
Pueblo Viejo Meanwhile,9,This was our second time visiting the Pueblo Viejo truck at Meanwhile when we were there with friends on Saturday night. The food is decent  but it s an organizational shitshow.  We ve tried the guac and salsa  both great  but the queso is just pure melted Velveeta and absolutely nothing else. Tried the fish taco this time and one of the meat ones last time--again  both solid  no complaints. The Mexican salad  added saut ed veggies  was surprisingly good all things considered and our whole family  and a couple friends  enjoyed the quesadilla plate. Prices are a little high  but the value is there.  Honestly  we would have been happy to have given this place four stars  but the service is complete chaos. There was no confirmation text once you put your order in and after over 30 minutes of not hearing anything  we went there to find our food just sitting out. It was completely unprofessional as it seems like there is no system whatsoever here. We ll likely go for the pizza or BBQ place next time since we really did not appreciate the business model at this truck--hopefully they ll get their act together at some point.
Pueblo Viejo Meanwhile,10,The tacos do not disappoint. Consistently good  amp  no better place to enjoy than  picnic table at Meanwhile.
Pueblo Viejo Meanwhile,11,Just had the Gordita plate with beef  amp  it was delicious. Forgot to take a before pic. I ll definitely be back  especially when I get to pair it with a delicious hazy IPA
Pueblo Viejo Meanwhile,12,I d post a picture of the burrito but I already ate it. They are consistently consistent in quality and service. The pricing seems high for what I get. The flavors remind me of my grandma s cooking. I miss her. She only spoke Spanish and I at the time only English. I felt like she loved me but I never knew if she said it. I know I said it to her. I hope she knows how I felt. I learned Spanish later in life so I never miss out on an opportunity to express how I feel. The world is smaller when you learn other languages and culture. I wish it was smaller sooner but at least I have the burrito from Pueblo Viejo.
Pueblo Viejo Meanwhile,13,To be fair we only ordered quac... And I was unsure if I wanted to order bc of price. But we got a HUGE portion of guac and a side of salsa. They gave it to us right away so we didn t have to wait. We ate through all the chips and they were nice enough to refill our chip basket and she was super sweet.
Pueblo Viejo Meanwhile,14,wow  Just wolfed down a Midas plate. I m not usually a potatoes person  the red potatoes  tomato sauce and garlic hit was spot on  Migas with red salsa was that great combo of soft  crispy and oh so delicious . Taste buds b dancing
Pueblo Viejo Meanwhile,15,I usually enjoy the Al pastor tacos here  but today s tacos were off  January 13th . The meat seemed drier  as if the cut of meat wasn t right. Pretty sad because it s the only reason I come to meanwhile in the mornings.
Pueblo Viejo Meanwhile,16,The only reason this place gets 2 stars and not 1 is due to the chips and queso being somewhat ok and consistent. Other than that  waste of time standing in line and huge waste of money. Over priced  bad service and rarely gets the order right.  God forbid you need napkins.
Pueblo Viejo Meanwhile,17,Quite possibly Austin s lamest taco truck. They get customers because of their attachment to the popular Meanwhile Brewing  which provides a captive audience. But the results are grim. When Pueblo Viejo runs out of stuff  they don t indicate it on their menu  so after you ve waited in line for half an hour while they screw up someone else s order  you get to the front and find out your whole order is now messed up and then you waste more time for more people. Worst flour tortillas I ve ever had  only ordered it because they ran out of corn...   like eating a rubber drain stopper or something. The chips and queso might as well come from HEB  and I guess they probably do. The veggie tacos and taco nes couldn t have sucked more. Just bland  bland  bland. The Pueblo Viejo taco had no flavor  only ridiculously excessive spiciness.  I like spicy food  but there s more to life than heat.  Pissy service  too. Why not at least tell people up front that you re out of stuff  rather than snap at them every time they attempt to order something you don t have  I like Meanwhile  so I hope they kick out Pueblo Viejo soon and bring in something decent to replace it.
Taqueria Johnny Tacos,1,My new favorite taco place in Austin  The red sauce is ACTUALLY spicy and has really good flavor  The green sauce is not as spicy  but still has a slight kick and amazing flavor. From the fresh pico to how the food just melts as soon as you bite into it  I cannot recommend this place enough. I crave food from this place 24 7 definitely a must try place     Talked to the guy who runs it and he says they opened a few months ago. He seems super nice and loves what he does   
Taqueria Johnny Tacos,2,Literally came here cause it was the closest thing around. i would have eaten just about anything but thank God they were open and there was no line. It decided to drop 40 degrees today for no reason today  something about being November  and this was just was the doctor ordered. I was too hungry to take photos of the food but it was my savior tonight
Taqueria Johnny Tacos,3,Got this delivered via Uber Eats - it was AMAZING.   The Birria tacos are a MUST. Rich  delicious melty cheese  and so much flavor  Loved the freshness of the pico on top. They come in an order of 3  plenty to share.  And the bean and cheese tacos with the  super spicy  red salsa  Yes PLEASE. Comes with a big slice of ripe avocado  but I ll ask for diced onions as well next time.   My husband loved the beef fajita  as well  but I didn t try it.   So glad we stumbled upon this after most things were closed post concert.   Green salsa is much milder  for those interested  Will get this again 100 
Taqueria Johnny Tacos,4,Just stumbled on this place for delivery late night. The food arrived quick and hot  from a food truck too . Got the birria quesadilla and queso compuesto... very yummy
Taqueria Johnny Tacos,5,Easily the best tacos I ve had so far   I got their fish and shrimp tacos and they were so juicy and flavorful. Absolutely recommend and will be back 
Taqueria Johnny Tacos,6,Some of the best authentic Mexican tacos in Austin Texas. My favorite is the queso  amp  carne asada tacos.
Taqueria Johnny Tacos,7,Randomly ordered delivery from here and it s now my favorite place for tacos de bistek  They have a slight variation they call Tacos Locos which adds melted mozzarella  grilled onions  and a roasted jalapeno. It is also awesome.
Taqueria Johnny Tacos,8,Late night Postmates  this food was EVERYTHING. Best torta I ve had in Austin  All the tacos were amazing and nachos were loaded 
Taqueria Johnny Tacos,9,Short version  -Unethical food truck owner -Verbally ABUSIVE food truck owner -Inconsistent and very long wait times  -Poor communication from the owner -Owner happens to have serious anger issues  -Owner is extremely rude and disrespectful -Owner is extremely unprofessional -Poor customer service  Long version  I was initially told that the wait time for my order pick up would be 10-12 minutes  so I set my timer for 12 minutes. When my timer went off  I was told to wait an additional 5 minutes that quickly turned into 10  additional minutes.  So my overall wait time was 20  minutes. 20  minutes is a lot longer than the initial wait time of 10-12 minutes. I had every right to ask for an update on the order each time my timer went off. The owner had no reason to verbally attack me and scream profanity at me as he accused me of  rushing him  when I simply asked for an update on the order. The owner has broken English  but he is surprisingly fluent when it comes to screaming in English profanity. His irrational temper has definitely caught me by surprise. The owner of this food truck is an abusive psychopath with serious anger issues  very poor communication skills  and has absolutely ZERO respect for others. You can get significantly better Mexican food elsewhere without putting up with verbal abuse from an irrational psychopath.
Taqueria Johnny Tacos,10,Our second time having Johnnys birria and Al pastor tacos. Super delicious  Caters more to the late night crowd but we enjoyed them more sober 
Taqueria Johnny Tacos,11,Best tacos I ve found in Austin after 10 years. We ve probably tried half the menu by now and it doesn t disappoint
Taqueria La Chilanguita,1,Taco mile  Taco crawl  Of the places we went on our recent taco crawl  I think Taqueria La Chilanguita was my personal favorite. Prices are decent  tacos are big  juicy and flavorful. The meat is very well seasoned and the tortillas taste fresh too.  I really liked the cabeza and the barbacoa. Barbacoa is normally my gold standard to judging taco places and it definitely passes with flying colors here. The cabeza though has become something I liked at more places  as it has the richer fatty flavors I crave that cut well with the salsa. I don t think you can really go wrong no matter what meat you choose  and that s saying something given they seem to have the most meats of any food truck on the taco mile  though they may not necessarily have all of them at a given time . But all in all  they ve simply just mastered the art of simplicity in their food.   Definitely give them a try  You won t be disappointed.
Taqueria La Chilanguita,2,Food truck in the Texaco gas store lot. Authentic Mexican food    Food is good and they give you generous portions. The tacos de Cabeza have been the best I ve found here in Austin  so good   They didn t have any aguas frescas so wasn t able to try them.     I didn t really like the tripitas. I asked for them  extra doraditas  but they weren t. They were pretty runny - see picture so I wouldn t recommend them.   Relatively inexpensive. We got 5 tacos  1 huarache  and 2 Mexican cokes and paid   24. They accept card and are open pretty late which is a big plus  We will be going back to try more items  They also have a few other food trucks around in that same area so we re excited to go back 
Taqueria La Chilanguita,3,Very cute atmosphere considering its food trucks at a gas station. The lights and music are what drew us in  but the food is what will bring me back every time  The food was excellent I mean absolutely delicious authentic tacos. I got 4 barbacoa tacos and asada quesadilla which came out to 18  but I was charged 20  so kinda pricey but worth it truly. The wait was also kind of long and the line combined with the ordering and pickup process was chaotic but overall I will return because the food was truly 5 stars. That s all the really matters
Taqueria La Chilanguita,4,This is one of the best hole in the wall food trucks  Everything tastes amazing  And I love how late they re open  They cook once you order of course. Just ordered their Horchata for the first time  usually I go to the gas station nextdoor to get a drink  but I have to say honestly  it s not the best nor the worst. I always expect Horchata to be in a bin and you scoop it out. They have one of those running lemonade looking things with it in there. Again  not bad  not great. But back to their tacos  Man are they good  I love getting their Pastor Tacos and their Huarache with Pastor as well. Check out for yourselves. Don t judge this place by the atmosphere. Everyone there is there for the same reason. To eat and chill out. There are times I ll just chill on the tailgate eating and people watch. Pretty fun from time to time. All in all  everyone has their own opinion. This is mine. Enjoy 
Taqueria La Chilanguita,5,Great prices and great food  It can take a while sometimes  night hours  but they re still pretty decent on timeliness  I ve found it s best to call ahead and order for pick up. Their huaraches and sopes are so good and they have a variety of meats to choose from
Taqueria La Chilanguita,6,The food is really good home made tortillas order tacos de cabeza is really good is like barbacoa taco taste like in Mexico City. It has space to eat here   La comida esta muy buena Los buen tama o de tacos los tacos de cabeza como si estuviera en la Cuidad de M xico muy ricos tortillas echas a mano
Taqueria La Chilanguita,7,Best Authentic Mexican food in Austin hands down. Gorditas and Huaraches are huge and so good and filling. I loved their Pambazos. Also had tacos de cochinita pibil and chicharon verde. I eat here at least once a week. Support this business so worth your money
Taqueria La Chilanguita,8,For the first time i can say Authentic Mexican Street Tacos and Garnachas  just Amazing   Quality and made from scratch    
Taqueria La Chilanguita,9,So frickin good. Best item is chicharron prensado when they have it and make sure you get it on a pambazo or anything really.
Taqueria La Chilanguita,10,Nice customer service  clean food truck  skimpy portions. My pambazo was seriously lacking potatoes and chorizo. It was mostly bread and at  7 I d expect a little more meat and potatoes.
Taqueria La Chilanguita,11,I went there yesterday and the food was so good I got seconds. I got a gringa  my parents got tacos  my sister got a quesadilla  and my brother got a burrito they were so good. The size of the food was not small it was pretty big definitely recommend 
El Marisquero Seafood,1,Finally real Mexican seafood  Had the Baja fish taco and it was great. The ceviche de camar n tostada hit the spot. It s my second time here and will keep coming back.
El Marisquero Seafood,2,Highly recommend this place. Best seafood I ve tried in a long time. You have to order the Aguachiles Rojos.  The shrimp tacos are AMAZING    Don t let the appearance fool yoThis is a must come to spot next time I come to Austin.
El Marisquero Seafood,3,I m picky with my seafood so I m so happy I found this. Everything is made to order and the seafood is picked up fresh daily. The flavors are amazing. Authentic Mexican seafood dishes. Amazing.
El Marisquero Seafood,4,Very fresh  and delicious. Would recommend anyone who has never had true ceviche to try it here. Don t judge this book by it s cover. I had the Ceviche Borracho
El Marisquero Seafood,5,Incredible aguachiles  octopus  shrimp cocteles  tuna tacos...everything on the menu is incredible. They re not just the best food truck  -- El Marisquero is the single best   restaurant   in Austin.
El Marisquero Seafood,6,Just got 2 fried fish tacos  2 grilled shrimp tacos and 2 different ceviche for my wife and I and everything was ABSOLUTELY OUTSTANDING    I just moved a mile and half away from here and will definitely be back  Probably weekly
El Marisquero Seafood,7,I came back again to order something different and  after I ordered they ran out of cooking fuel so instead of having me wait there they delivered my food to me at home. A1 customer service. I love this place 
La Chapala,1,A local recommendation when asking for Mexican food but definitely not Tex-Mex style but more of a SoCal type. The employees are nice and may not understand my broken Spanish but they also speak English really well. The service is somewhat slow but that means food is made to order.   Authentic food from breakfast options  to seafood and even Micheladas. Party of 12 was a bit much but fit us between 3 tables but there are booth options.
La Chapala,2,Pretty sizable portions a a decent price. Food is pretty good for the cost. Cute Mexican decor and lots variety  of authentic Mexican dishes. This is a hidden gem one the few left in Austin.
La Chapala,3,Definitely my go to Mexican restaurant on the south side. It is inexpensive and the good is delicious. I have tried it several time already and it has not disappointed. One minor detail however  they only serve beer and no cocktails or wine  other than that highly recommend. The staff of lovely and the quality of service is outstanding  two thumbs up
La Chapala,4,I ve been eating at Chapala for years and am a little embarrassed I haven t taken the time to write a review yet   Solid  authentic Mexican at a great price.  My favorite salsa in town  made in-house. Not the tomato paste type  but rather the fresh veggie type -- to be clear  I recognize that the paste type is a valid style  it s just not my preference .  No black beans offered  but their charro beans are legit.  Their shrimp soup has replaced Dong Nai s egg noodle as my favorite in town. Mexican style with the giant carrots etc  I have their breakfast tacos  eggs and bacon with salsa  twice a week.   Other dishes of theirs I love  Chicken Enchiladas  green sauce  charro beans  with an order of sour cream on the side  Pork chops  Flautas  Chicken tacos with onions and cilantro on corn  Parrilladas   Honestly I haven t tried anything else of theirs  it s hard to branch out when I know I love the above dishes  you know 
La Chapala,5,The hostess was very disrespectful and annoyed we were coming to eat at the business   but once I talked to Jaza   who is also a manager there everything was perfect . I love this restaurant   we actually come here quite a lot . This was my first bad experience   and it wasn t bad it was just the hostess . She wasn t happy with her job so why was she here   Lol dosent make since   but Jaza  is amazing     amp  every other server and hostess besides her   were VERY helpful . Definitely will be coming back soon  
La Chapala,6,I don t like writing bad reviews but I am considering calling the health department due to the   2  RAT TURDS rolled up in my tortillas.  This place is nasty.  Completely grossed out.  Don t eat here.
La Chapala,7,I Like this restaurant a lot   the food and service here is always top notch.  I don t quit like it as much as there Oak Hill location  Taqueria Chapala  however I would still rank this among my favorite Mexican restaurants.  Their new interior decorating is like no other restaurant I ve seen around.  It is really colorful  authentic and makes you feel like you ve walked into Mexico with all.
La Chapala,8,They took a bigger tip from my credit card than what I had put on the bill. Do they really think people don t check their credit card statements  I don t know what the restaurant business calls this  but I call it stealing. Never going there again.
La Chapala,9,Not bad but not great. Better than just Tex-Mex with some variety. Carne Guisada was below average. Not sure I will go back but for the price you might find a gem there one day.
La Chapala,10,We were looking for a random new place to try and stumbled on this. Food was good  service was fantastic and we were pleasantly surprised. We will definitely go back sometime
La Chapala,11,A great inexpensive option if you re in the area and want Mexican food. No liquor license so you ll have to look elsewhere for margaritas but they still have beer and I like the service atmosphere here. Short wait times for food and plenty of parking.
La Chapala,12,Tried the caldo de res today and it was amazing.  Tastes like it had been stewing forever and wonderful deep beef broth flavor.  It also came with a good amount of beef as well.  A must try and a definite go back for dish.
La Chapala,13,One taco at a time  this establishment is taking over my tummy.   4 stars because the red sauce is not very good. Go with green  and your in the clean.   Wait staff  Straight 7 s across the board. These ladies provide valuable eye candy while I m remembering the correct combination of beans  eggs  cheese  bacon  chorizo  potato  pepper  onion  or even beans.  Come for the tacos  stay for the hospitality. Amen.
La Chapala,14,Not quite as good as the one in Oak hill - service was a bit slower and prices higher. Salsa was terrific- and as good as anything else close by. Chips were fresh - I had the combination plate see picture
La Chapala,15,So tired of them getting my order wrong. Food is fine  but there s plenty of good TexMex places. One time my order was so wrong that I sent it back - which is something I do like once every 10 years.   And here s today s episode with my to go order    Yeah  I just got home and my order s totally wrong. Not even close.    I m sorry. She doesn t understand English.    Well  how do you say enchilada in Spanish     Enchilada.    Exactly.   Then I was told if I want to drive all the way back  in the middle of Congress traffic  they d do me the grand favor of remaking my order. Wouldn t credit me  wouldn t give me a discount next time  nothing....  Well  I won t be driving back there today or any other day.  Like I said  plenty of great places to get Mexican food in South Austin.
La Chapala,16,This little taqueria has been improving ever since it opened. My family and I are pretty loyal customers so we definitely get our taco fix here. For the most part that s all I order because the fajita and barbacoa tacos are really good. I appreciate their salsa and chips too  very fresh. I definitely have to comment about their renovations too  they seem to spruce up the place a lot and I think it s very fitting to the feel of the place. The service here is pretty fast but it can get crowded too especially during the lunch hour. Overall  I ve never had a bad experience here except that time that they ran out of barbacoa meat...
La Chapala,17,This place has the promise of authenticity if not the the most consistent food.  I had a very tasty curry of beef tongue in a tomatillo sauce which was very tasty   But then the Sope was very strange. The substrate was this thin and fried-to a crisp wafer of masa. Not the nice  hand-pressed Masa you get at so many other places. And the cheese on it was Monterey Jack instead of queso fresco. It s clearly not their thing.  With so many places making their own corn tortillas  I am now getting dissappointed when I get served store bought. But really  I am probably just getting spoiled on that front. There is really nothing wrong with a store bought corn tortilla. I got great ones at Juan s for years   Salsa  2 great authentic green ones pretty close to the standard bearers  Fruta Feliz .  Not bad. Worth further exploration...
La Chapala,18,DISCLAIMER  I m a vegan gringo  and although also gringo  my carnivorous parents approve. And it s probably a good sign that most of the patrons are not gringos.  FOOD  Best nopales evaaar  Hefty portion of avocado. Their corn tortillas have the perfect texture and don t crack when rolled. Salsa is great. All in all  it felt fresh and light for mexican food. Parents raved over an enchilada plate and carne guisada.  PRICE  Tacos for less than  2 at lunch  and  1 tacos at breakfast  before 11am . Each taco comes with two tortillas. My sister and I did lunch for less than  10 before tip.   SERVICE  Tip like the food s not cheap  They are always quick  friendly  and patient with my spanglish.
La Chapala,19,Just had some of he best chilaquiles I ve ever had. Green sauce was great  the salsa was great  service was solid. Definitely a solid option for breakfast.  10 total including an iced tea  Can t wait to try other dishes.
La Chapala,20,I never would have known about this place had I not had car trouble nearby.  While my hero manly man replaced the starter on my car...we stopped in here to grab a quick lunch during the ordeal.  Knowing I was about to fork over major cash for car repair  I really appreciated the 4.99 lunch special. We both got that...Thursday enchiladas. Chicken with Green Sauce. He had the Beef with Red Sauce. Both were adequately slathered with cheese  mine white  his yellow. 3 to a plate and they were thick and delicious. The salsa was a tad salty but still tasty. The waitress didn t mind fixing us to go ice teas which we were happy to have later as we continued the quest for auto parts...got outta there for around 15 bucks and plenty full.
La Chapala,21,This was my fourth experience here.  The first three were fine.  This past experience was the worst.  I had asked for my eggs over easy.  A simple request as a dinner.  Eggs come out medium.  There s a difference.  I asked for a new eggs please.  As I waited I started eating the bacon and toast.  As I grab a piece of toast they had served the end piece of the loaf.  In all of my dinning I cant remember being served the end piece of the loaf.  I then asked for a new piece.  After seven minutes of waiting on the eggs my toast comes out.  I asked where my eggs were and they didn t know.  I asked for a manager and was told there wasn t one.  I got up from my breakfast and left.  Now  this is first world problems I know.  However  they need to pay attention to the details and they failed 
La Chapala,22,The green sauce knocked the snot right out of me... in a good way. And any place that gives me a giant squeeze bottle of the stuff is golden in my book. It s like the TacoDeli dona sauce but without the portion control. No more licking the inside of those little cups hoping for one more drop of fiery green bliss. Here  my inner salsa addict can leave satisfied.
La Chapala,23,You can get 3 breakfast tacos here for  2.99. There neither bad nor great. Just OK. The included salsa was a bit too watery for me as well. The tacos were cheap and did not leave me hungry. However  like I said before  they were just OK.
La Chapala,24,Pretty good food but the service was a little slow. I suppose I can forgive them because they had to prepare for a party of eleven or so.  I ordered shrimp with an avocado margarita. It was excellent. Great atmosphere  good food  it was just a fun time. I would definitely come back again.
La Chapala,25,Sorry  I only eat one thing here.  Steak Tacos with Cheese and Peppers.  This place is the real deal.  I m from Cali  and all these  Tex-Mex  tacos are disgusting.    This is yummy.   Good steak  good cheese  good Peppers.  I eat here at least twice a week.  If you think Taco Cabana is yummy  this is not for you.  Just going to be straight up  plenty of legit Latinos in here  so you know its good.
La Chapala,26,Just really great super legit mexican food. Love the salsa served with the chips. LOVE the horchata. Love the charro beans  seriously sometimes I skip that rice and get a double portion of charro beans in a small bowl. Beyond that the enchiladas are great  as well everything else I ve ever had there.
La Chapala,27,I get my car serviced in walking distance  so I always stop in for breakfast tacos. I love the salsa. The Bacon is deliciously crispy. The service is fantastic. And the chairs are amazing. If you re nearby  this place is great for takeout or sit in.
La Chapala,28,There are obviously better places than Chapala. But you know  for a neighborhood dive  its really pretty good.  My daughter liked her meal a lot. I was surprised they served Chilaquilles there.  The food was hot  the mom of the mom and pop team was really sweet.  Her English was   how are ju .  Which is a good sign of things to come generally.  You know  the thing that stood out really was the salsa.  They make really really good salsa.  It was very surprising to me. Everything was fresh. Nothing came out of the warmer.  It s kind of like going to somebody s aunt s kitchen.  They have a lot of stuff on the menu. All of its low priced.  Its hot fresh and plentiful.
La Chapala,29,I love this place. We come over here after church every other Sunday or so  and we can t get enough of it. From the fantastic corn tortillas that don t tear up to the Spec al Quesadillas  there is something for almost everyone here  whether you like authentic Mexican cooking or the milder TexMex version. And save room for great flan  If you manage to not fill up on chips and salsa before your meal  you will have room and cash left over for a tasty dessert. I m not so crazy about the canteloupe nectar or the tres leches cake. Service is always friendly and helpful.
La Chapala,30,This is oddly one of my favorite restaurants in Austin They give you a Free hot batch of Chips with Salsa no matter what when you sit down  their Prices are killer  and every Meal I have had there has been 100  on point. I usually get the same thing every time. Tall Glass of Water  Bottomless Coffee  and then the Chapala Breakfast that has 4 slices of toast with jelly   Bacon  Sausage  2 eggs  and home Fries and my final tab when I leave is about 7 bucks and thats after a couple dollars tip. Another few meals that are good is the Beef Fajita Quesadilla Special  or the Beef Fajita Dinner..Enjoy
La Chapala,31,My hubby drove by this place and decided he wanted us to try it. I am so glad he did  Not only was the food reasonably priced  everything was delicious  I highly recommend this restaurant if you are looking for delicious cheap eats. I will definitely be a returning customer. This has become our Wednesday dinner place.
La Chapala,32,Me and my husband tried this place out for the first time and needless to say we will never go there again  first it started with bad service then we noticed they had a full trash can right next to our table flies everywhere no good
La Chapala,33,Big meh...I has the Milanesa torta and it tasted like the old oil it was cooked in. They have a green salsa which i have had many times other places and this one was bland and it had no kick. At least it was cheap.
La Chapala,34,I ordered their enchiladas and a taco and wasn t impressed. The roomy and I went here some time last year and I can t even remember what I had. I guess that s how forgettable this place is. To be honest I only like my enchiladas from El Borrego. I did like their taco. It wasn t anything special and it tasted like something from Taco Bell. So now I know where I can go for my late night Taco cravings.
La Chapala,35,My family ate here Sunday brunch time and it was delicious and affordable.  We ordered the ceviche  quesadillas  and enchiladas.  All the food was tasty and fresh.  We loved all of the salsas.  The service was great too.  It doesn t look like much from the outside  but if you are looking for some affordable  authentic Tex Mex you should check it out.
La Chapala,36,While the pricing is pretty cheap  I found the food tasted fairly cheap as well.  I ordered breakfast  migas and a beef tounge taco  on a Saturday morning.  The migas came out looking like an egg caserole.  The taco was very good  but I found the tortilla to taste more or less like a store-bought one.  The service was quick and unspectacular.  All and all  totally edible  but not a place I am likely to revisit.
Sabe,1,Sabe has the most amazing options that are all delicious  When I arrived I saw them cutting fresh fruit  which I love so much more than frozen. It s all authentic and fresh    Bonus  is its right next to La Monta a taco shop so I got my watermelon agua Fresca  translates to fresh water  and refers to the fresh juices and fruit they offer  and my delicious tacos  I saw her blend my fruit right in front of me so you know it s fresh and delicious. Was my first time here but I can t wait to come back all the time 
Sabe,2,Great fruit cups  The agua preparada is also something I d recommend if you like Topo Chico  lime  and tajin 
Sabe,3,My family and I enjoy coming here to satisfy our sweet tooth  We go almost weekly  We adventure out to other new places but we always find ourselves coming back here  The only reason I didn t give a five stars is because of the personnel. Sometimes they can be in a bad mood.
Sabe,4,my go to fresh juice spot. I discovered this small business while waiting for  tacos  the place next door is great  and have been a regular for years.  This store appears to be owned and operated by a few ladies and it s geared to serve the spanish speaking community. Everything on the menu is in spanish first  english second. I ve not tried much on their menu  quite extensive and items I don t understand  and am mostly a regular for their OJ      It s fresh orange juice that s made to order and the price   quantity is fantastic value. They ve got many other fruits  smoothies and desserts too. If you want some truly fresh juice  w o the austin premium you should try this place.
Sabe,5,Still loving it  Still awesome.  I ve went to several diff places trying the  energ tico  and my kids demand we go to this one.  It s so good. Love their corn and most of all their fresh made juice  they re perfect for when you re feeling yucky
Sabe,6,This place is the best to get yourself a amazing Mexican snacks   Will recommend    Having the best of the best snacks   Whoop whoop  
Sabe,7,Love Love love this place. The ladies I work with got me hooked on the strawberries and cream.
Sabe,8,Interesting Mexican smoothie and juice house. Authentic Mexican snacks.  Fresh fruits.
Sabe,9,One of my favorite spots to hit up for authentic Mexican snacks. Such great people work here and they truly do take the time to prepare your food with care. Really can t recommend this place enough.
Taco Break,1,Well we are out and about and shopping for a Fan at Lowe s Home Improvement Store and decided to get some Brats for a Fourth of July Lunch and the service was top notch the Employee was very nice and helpful and the Food was Fantastic   we got 4 Bratwursts  I got 2 of my Brats with Mustard and Onions and Jalapenos  Dad got his 2 with Kraut and onions and maybe Mustard   anyway they were  all very good.
Taco Break,2,Really good breakfast tacos. I ll be back to try the tortas later. Staff was very friendly  fast service.
Taco Break,3,Do yourself a favor and order a pastor torta all the way before you run into Lowe s. It ll be ready when you get out and your stomach will thank you 
Taco Break,4,By far the best breakfast tacos in Austin  At a price that won t break the bank    5 STARS  
Taco Break,5,Really solid taco truck with a big menu. Owners are very nice people and prices are reasonable. Also fun to walk around Lowe s while you wait.  Had breakfast tacos and al pastor and steak tacos and will def return and try more of their menu. And If you re a gringo like me  just be warned. The hot sauce is HOT 
Taco Break,6,If you re at the Lowes  knock yourself out  but don t go out of your way to try this place  it s just o.k. The meat was a little bland and dry. I poured salsa on the tacos and they were still real dry. The tortillas were not homemade  more like store bought. Solid 3-stars but not more.
Taco Break,7,The staff was friendly and didn t take too long to get my order made. I got the steak quesadilla and it was pretty pretty good along with some green hot sauce  I ll be visiting again   
Taco Break,8,This place is fire  I haven t had a taco place since home but this place should open a spot up DownTown bc words cant even explain my happiness with the tacos. It definitely hit the spot     
Taco Break,9,Stop your taco search now. Every time that I land in Austin  I will be heading right to the Lowe s parking lot for the best carnitas and barbacoa tacos  served in generous portions on a piping hot fresh corn tortilla. At  2.50 taco  it is hard to find much to complain about.
Taco Break,10,I tried a chicken taco for a mid-afternoon snack after shopping at Lowe s. The chicken was hot and fresh and full of flavor. The corn tortilla was homemade and delicious. All-in-all  perfect. I eat a lot of tacos  this was among the best I ve had.
Taco Break,11,Best tacos in Austin. The owners are very friendly  and prices are very reasonable.  I highly recommend the beef fajita taco. Excellent.  I m certain anything and everything is good and it s in a great location. I definitely will be going back  I want to try everything on the menu.
Taco Break,12,I ordered a few tacos to try out an assortment.   The service seemed legit at first  but then I ended up waiting longer than I should have.  I was told I would be alerted when my order was ready  but I wasn t and ended up finally just asking if it was ready.  It was luckily  but then they acted like  why didn t you check sooner .   And then the tacos were bland and lacking any kind of flavor profile.  I was hoping for good tacos  but you won t find them here.  And to top it off  they charged me more per taco than is listed on their menu.
Taco Break,13,I stopped here once after getting some stuff at Lowe s.  I couldn t believe how good the carnitas with cilantro and onion were.  Definitely get it on corn and get the green salsa.  The corn tortillas were grilled nice and crispy and the green salsa was full of flavor.  I just brought some home to my wife to validate I wasn t crazy for thinking some of of the best tacos in Austin are at a truck in front of Lowe s.  I need to try the barbacoa next.
Taqueria Piedra Grande,1,Best tacos in Austin... Hands. Down.  I was fortunate enough to misunderstand some directions to Rositas up the road and ended up at this gem. It s a no frills straightforward authentic experience with the best seasoned meat wrapped in homemade tortillas that you can buy. Bistec  chorizo and barbacoa are phenomenal. Phenomenal as in you d sacrifice a good night of sleep to wake up at 2 am to go buy more and STILL not be able to sleep while laying awake thinking about going back again in the morning for more.  This is more of a grab and go kind of place so take your tacos and find a secluded place where no one can hear you moan with delight. Whether you know authentic or not  just GO. You won t be disappointed. And if you are  you re probably unaware of life s finer pleasures. Which is ok... just sad though.  A QUICK NOTE   I ve read the reviews of people calling the staff rude. But you ve got to put those in perspective. This place is not a trendy chic Eastside food truck with an instagram following that has national presence and draw. It s located on the side of a busy road in an inconvenient location where the staff has to sit all day regardless or not if you come skipping up to the window with a smile and a pending yelp review in your back pocket.  These are authentic people making authentic tacos as a way of life. Not as a social experiment. Go here. Often.
Taqueria Piedra Grande,2,Not what I expected  barbacoa tacos where super watery and Al pastor was mediocre  I was really looking forward to these tacos but really can t say anything good about them
Taqueria Piedra Grande,3,Just wow.... amazing late night tacos that you would definitely want to have sober as well   Open until 3am 4am  The tortillas are homemade and the meat is flavorful. Remember to bring cash and expect a line.
Taqueria Piedra Grande,4,The tacos were good... when I finally got them. I ordered my food late night on Sunday with a couple people who ordered ahead of me.  It took over 90 minutes for me to get my order... this place wasn t even that busy  way less busy then Rositas Al pastor is even on a slow night  still took over 90 minutes for my order to be finished.  Was the food worth the wait  No.  The food was cooked well  but there was absolutely no seasoning to any of the meat to the tacos. If I m waiting over 90 minutes at 3am for a taco  I would love to be thoroughly satiated by the flavor of said taco... this was not the case  the juice was not worth the squeeze... the squeeze being waiting over 90 minutes for  bland flavored tacos.... If you have a choice and Rositas is open  go to Rositas no matter how long the line is. I guarantee you ll be served faster at Rositas with more flavorful dishes than at this place. I will never order anything from this time sink of place  ever again.
Taqueria Piedra Grande,5,Misunderstood the directions to Rosita s and came to this food truck. Then found out rosita s is in the next block but the line was too long and I didn t have time to wait. Ordered bistek taco  chorizo taco and gringas  with pastor meat . Overall  the food was okay. Meat was slightly hard and was not adequately marinated. There is a seating area in front of the truck if you d like to eat there.
Taqueria Piedra Grande,6,Meh.  Something was off about the taste of all of our orders. We all tried each other s food and none of it was just even ok.   Underwhelming and under seasoned.  The only bright lighthouse for this slowly sinking ship in a fog filled sea was the plain bean and cheese burrito  not that it was great  but the only one that liked it was our finicky eater so that has to account for at least a 2nd star  yeah   There s better taquitos a block up or down Riverside.
Taqueria Piedra Grande,7,My favorite is the pastor bambaso and the carne asada quesadilla  their food is great one of the best taco trucks I go to
Taqueria Piedra Grande,8,Legit taco truck with homemade tortillas corn or flour. Open late and super cheap  2 tacos. Green hot sauce makes my eyes tear but I love it  not the kind of spicy that lingers too long  unless you have a lot of it . Random taco trucks are the beeeeeest not the ones in a lot full of other food trucks...
Taqueria Piedra Grande,9,Great  for when you re drunk or sober  the spicy green and red sauce is reason enough to visit. Locally owned  and open until 3am
Taqueria Piedra Grande,10,Best gringas in town  Seriously they give rositas a run for their money. Home made corn tortillas nbd.
Taqueria Piedra Grande,11,I visited Taqueria Piedra Grande 2 on a late evening.   We drove by and found the very well-lit food truck open for business.   The food truck had a covered dine-in area and a good selection of foods to choose from.   We tried the beef quesadillas  a bacon and egg breakfast burrito  gasp  I had forgotten cheese   and a barbacoa wrap.  1.  Barbacoa wrap  I ordered it only with cilantro. I normally enjoy the fatty barbacoa and the simplicity of cilantro on a flour tortilla.  Unfortunately  the barbacoa was dry and not very tasteful.  The amount of barbacoa was good  I wished it was more moist.  2.  Breakfast Burrito  Bacon  amp  Egg    It was very silly of me but I read straight off the menu and it didn t say cheese and I didn t think to add cheese. Cheese makes everything better  There was a good amount of egg and bacon and the flour tortilla was just right.    3.  Beef Quesadilla  I only had a bite  but man it was good. Really  really good. The fajita beef was perfect and savory and moist. There s just enough cheese. Even as I m writing this review I m thinking about having one right now.  If I m ever that way again  I ll definitely order correctly and give everything another try. On my maiden trip  I was very impressed and plan to go again.
Taqueria Piedra Grande,12,Was going to go to another taqueria next to this one but I am so glad I didn t.  I had a Gordita de lengua and taco de tripa.  Was so bomb  it definitely reminded me of the California Mexican food trucks which I dearly miss.  Glad I found this gem. No indoor seating.
Taqueria Piedra Grande,13,Really delicious tacos  We got the carne tacos and I got the breakfast egg and potato taco with cheese  onion  cilantro and they were all delish 
Taqueria Piedra Grande,14,Found this gem aimlessly wondering for an open Walgreens. It was late late and I was Hombre Mucho Mucho so I Froggered across Riverside and the lively bunch of locals told to just a Gordita and fugetaboutit. I ve been recommended a Carlzonor two like that but WTF is with Gordita. I prefer the flaquitas my self.  Oh wait this is a food truck review not OK Cupid search settings.   I got all up in that Gordita and luckily I was saved by a huge roll of paper towels. We re not talking vegan friendly recycled organic un bleached septic tank friendly hipster napkins they were old school lumber jack man paper towels.  On a side note they had to lay that dude off because all the wood in the Pacific North burned or already got turned into a Walmart parking lot which ironically provides a safe parking lot for the homeless lumber hacks and out of industries coal minors to sleep in their cars at night.   Back to tTacos  break out the red and green salsa and drizzle it over ass so phat you can see it from the front or back  Gorditas are almost always on pointe except when they are swamped. The Sope  which is quickly going from staple to relic disappointed and  piled so high you ll think you are in Denver Except at El Big Leg  dos there are no Microbrew small batch Blue Dream Marihuana  Texas penal code spelling. The J goes back in when Tejas decides to legalize it   infused tortilla option.   This one is toward the top of my rotation so check em out and say hi to El Gato Negro who lives a taco troll life below.
Taqueria Piedra Grande,15,Growing up on the border  these tacos taste like home. Austin has a lot of really questionable tacos but these taste the most authentic. The chorizo and egg are amazing for breakfast but the tacos de bistec are my favorite. And always leave a nice tip 
Taqueria Piedra Grande,16,Tried this place because my friend suggested it. She said it was better than the others on riverside. I thought she was just hyping it but it did not disappoint. I had the burrito and it was huge. They even give you a knife and fork because of how huge it is. I also had the melon water and it was soo good. A great meal for  8. I m hooked. Will definitely be going back.
Taqueria Piedra Grande,17,I am not Mexican so I don t know much about what s on the menu  and I had a lot of questions and the girl that was working had the worst attitude and customer service. I don t even want to eat the food  definitely not coming back here.
Taqueria Piedra Grande,18,Drunk and uber to El Taquito.. saw it was up a hill so went here instead and was blown away  Good barbacoa tacos
Taqueria Piedra Grande,19,Honestly one of my favorite taco trucks in Austin. They hand make their tortillas not like the busier taco truck a few feet away. Always fresh not always friendly but the tacos are worth it 
La Yaquesita Food Truck,1,I had the bistek tacos and they were flavorful tender and delicious      They were a good size too.  Try it out
La Yaquesita Food Truck,2,Amazing tacos   I got the bistec and pastor tacos and they were so good  The salsa verde is a bit on the spicier side but it s very delicious. The red salsa is more tolerable for those that don t like spicy foods. The tacos were big I m used to always receiving small tacos but at la yaquesita you ll get a big meaty taco . 10 10
La Yaquesita Food Truck,3,Accidentally stumbled on this place and it s so good   Close to Mueller  great tasting food  and big portions  Definitely coming back here again -- highly recommend.
La Yaquesita Food Truck,4,Y all.  Go here.  Get a gordita   They are amazing.  We went on an afternoon for a late lunch.  The ladies are so sweet and the food comes out piping hot  fresh and tasty   There are picnic tables to sit at and enjoy your food  as well.  I got a chicken fajita taco  they were out of beef .  Chicken was hot and tasty and seasoned perfectly.  Mark got a gordita and I totally wanted to steal it   It was absolutely scrumptious.  I can t wait to go back and get my own.      They have a wide variety of items to order  so I definitely want to go back and try more.  There s parking  picnic benches and the ladies bring out sauces  the crema on the gordita was heavenly   that range from no spice to OH SO SPICY  YUM 
La Yaquesita Food Truck,5,Very good. I m very happy to have such a good place to eat in the area. Great al pastor.
La Yaquesita Food Truck,6,Everything was tan incre ble  Def eat here   I asked for soup and she said she didn t have any and then said she had consume  which sounded like some French  something or other  and I said yes please   It was a groovy pepper based deal and I dipped my tacos into it like a happy crazy person and slipped deeper into culinary madness    Ps everything was super homemade with love  you want this food  
La Yaquesita Food Truck,7,We went today with my partner. Delicious  authentic and inexpensive  Looks like any food truck but there are seats inside. The service is awesome  you can feel the love in the food and the place  we loved the tacos and gorditas. My favorite was beef gordita and my bf loved the bacon breakfast taco. Thank you for a delicious dinner   We were so thrilled with the food that we forgot to take pictures  but there will be a next time for sure  
La Yaquesita Food Truck,8,If you are looking for homemade comfort food. This is the place to be    The food is AMAZING  I love the tacos  all of them  and  their gorditas  The soups are so flavorful and perfect in any weather. The Food is delivered within a few minutes and always with a smile. Staff is extremely friendly and make you feel at home.
Cilantro's,1,Great tacos . Found this place couple years back and can t speak enough about their food and service  It s a mom and pop joint that knows what they re doing   Do yourself a favor  and check it out.   Clean  great food  and excellent customer service
Cilantro's,2,Really Nice  amp  Chill Tex-Mex Restaurant Across the street from Me  last time I went unfortunately wasn t able to pay   so they kindly gave me the food low key was embarrassed... made it back to them couple days later when I went back and pay for that food and some Extra   amp  Definitely about to go right now on this Sunday Morning
Cilantro's,3,I don t get all these high star reviews. We finally went in to try this place out and it s NOT cheap and the food is NOT good. We ended up paying almost  60 for 2 adults and a child. There was a weird aftertaste on almost everything. The queso was microwaved  there was an obvious nasty film on top.  The beans tasted like they came out of a can. The fajita meat was older than my grandmother. Dry  brittle  amp  absolutely disgusting. The one redeeming quality was the salsa but based on how everything else tasted  it probably came from a jar.  To top it all off we decided to give them a second chance and got breakfast tacos. Not only are they tiny  there was a huge hair in one of mine. Appetite gone. Nasty.  Oh  I should add that they have hand written signs up inside that say  1 basket of chips per table      Extra chips  amp  salsa cost money  F that. What a joke. Charging for additional tortilla chips   a Mexican food place. Hahahahahaaaaaa go to hell.  Don t go here. You ll regret it.
Cilantro's,4,This is a little local spot  not fancy but it does the job.  My husband comes here for breakfast and lunch on weekly basis.  We tried many things  all good.
Cilantro's,5,Paid 11.22 for a water and a salad the size of a child s plate. Menu said 7.99 but doesn t mention extra charge if you pay with a debit card. Didn t know places charge you extra for using a debt card  seems illegal to me. Don t go here  super small servings and it s not even very good. Chicken tasted old  salad was wet and slimy. TOTAL RIP OFF        
Cilantro's,6,This cute  little hole in the wall is a great value  Right in my neighborhood  you can get 2 breakfast tacos for  3.25  I m not sure where else that can happen and the food actually be good  I m glad I tried this place  Staff is friendly too....beware  if you spend under  10  you must have cash 
Cilantro's,7,My goto spot after school. The food is delicious and they have great weekly specials. The staff is super helpful and friendly. Great food for a great price.
Cilantro's,8,When My work schedule allows this is my go to place for breakfast tacos  The service is great and the food is consistently good especially the Migas  
Cilantro's,9,Tiny hole in the wall.  Ordered migas plate  5.99 with bacon  2.00.  The salsa is to die for  but be careful because it is spicy hot and addictive.  Migas were a bit dry  but cover it with some of that addictive salsa and then you can t tell.  Came with beans and potatoes.  Potatoes were plain  beans tasted like they came from a can.  I think the tortillas might be home made  so not too bad there.  Biggest disappointment was the bacon.  Three slices of paper thin tasteless bacon for  2 is ridiculous.
Cilantro's,10,Good prices on tacos very fast only wish they would lower there credit minimum to like  5 instead of  10
Cilantro's,11,Great place to stop for breakfast tacos  Service is quick  and the tacos are delicious 
Cilantro's,12,Must write a review about this place now. Last time I ll eat here. Placed a to go order for two flauta plates. We received hot sauce for each order that equaled to less than a teaspoon  one of them was just light red water basically. When I received the order to go I asked for some more hot sauce and was told it would be an additional .25 cents each... For half a teaspoon of hot sauce  Should just have not tipped so high on the to go order. Funny thing is if I ate there they probably would have given us a cup of hot sauce  or would they have charged for it  who knows  I ll never go there or recommend this place again.
Cilantro's,13,Great food . Amazing amazing service . Everything in the menus is Trully amazing and you can t beat there prices
Cilantro's,14,This is one of my favorite places to get breakfast tacos. I can t really speak for their non breakfast menu items  but the breakfast is pretty good. I love their potatoes. Seriously  MAGIC POTATOES they re so tender.   The parking lot is tiny  and they re closed on Sundays. However the women behind the counter is very pleasant every time I go.
Cilantro's,15,I love love love the brekfast  as the sign out front reads  tacos at this place. They seem to use fresh ingredients and their SALSA is freakin  good--fresh tomatoes  cilantro  onion and garlic- all in a little plastic cup with a cap...especially for your taco to go. The bacon they use is extra yummy  they chop it up in small crispy pieces. If you need more grease in your taco- try the chorizo in your taco  mmmm authentic.  They have week night specials-- I recommend Wednesdays  taco night  3 beef tacos rice and beans- I think it is around  6. Locally owned- the people couldn t be nicer. Very neighborhoody feel when you dine in.
Cilantro's,16,This place is my heaven. They have great food  The salsa is fantastic and they have the best bean and cheese tacos everrrr   I m sad I don t live next door anymore but it s probably a good thing   Also  the two ladies that are there when I go in are so friendly  Love this place.
Cilantro's,17,This rating and review is for the breakfast tacos. So so so many mornings I have great service and great tacos 
Cilantro's,18,Excellent down home place to eat true Mexican food. Perfect Menudo even my Mom and Uncle loved and recommend. Tender and not too spicy. Muy Sabroso    Friendly staff and great conversation if you want.  Very good everflowing coffee. We go at least once a week usually twice.
Cilantro's,19,We stopped here for breakfast tacos on the way back from a Buda bike ride.  Cilantro s is a little dive.  Maybe a dozen tables  all covered in plastic tablecloths.  Cheap chairs.  Cash register sits above a mostly-empty glass display case featuring gum  toothpicks  and kiddy doodads.    We ordered sausage egg and chorizo egg.  They were hot and tasted fresh.  The salsa was good and not too spicy.  I think the tacos were  1.25 each.  This was my first visit  so I can t speak for the rest of the menu.  I ll endorse the breakfast tacos though.
Cilantro's,20,Breakfast tacos are all I know.  I live around the corner  poor me  and have ordered multiple times from them in the past 3 months.  They are about  2 each plus or minus 50 cents and worth every penny. They were ready within 5 minutes.   The cashier waitress was nice and never failed.
Cilantro's,21,Lately I ve been on a quest for caldo. Surprisingly  it s a little hard to find. The caldo at the Taqueria Arandas by my house is inconsistent  so I decided to try this place  since it is also fairly close by. I ve had great breakfast tacos here  too  so I figured they knew what was up. I went on a Sunday afternoon because I knew caldo was on special on Sundays. I asked the waitress what caldos they had  and she had to get the manager to translate my question. She was obviously pretty green  so I d rather her ask her boss than get my order wrong.   My husband s food came out first  which is weird  since I ordered the special. Doesn t that mean that they have a bunch of it cooked up and ready to go  There ain t much to pouring soup into a bowl. His food began to get cold as he waited for my caldo to come out  he s polite like that . I began to realize I was getting full on the chips and salsa I was snacking on to sate my hunger. I could taste that caldo now...warm  flavorful broth and juicy hunks of veggies. And then  my actual food came out of the kitchen. My heart sank as I looked down into the nuclear red mass of oil and vegetables. I d never seen caldo that looked like that before. I took a chip from our basket  and literally could scoop the oil from the surface of the soup. I d been waiting so long  that I decided to try it anyway. BLECH  There was no flavor  it literally tasted like hot canola oil soup. I darted my eyes around  looking for eye contact from one of the employees. Eventually I asked the manager if I could get something else  and it was  no problem  to order another dish. I was depressed. Delicious  warming  all-healing caldo was within reach  and then not so much. I replaced my first order with chicken fajita tacos  which were equally greasy and tasted exactly like HEB fajita seasoning.  The manager told me to come back and try the tortilla soup  but I don t know if I ll ever be returning. Cilantro s has numerous clippings on the walls of write-ups and honors  but those were mostly from a couple of years ago. I m not sure if they ve changed owners since then  or what  but this was not award-winning food  even for a quaint taqueria.
Cilantro's,22,Had breakfast  it was excellent.  Shredded beef  eggs and bacon.  The bacon was outstanding.  Coming back tomorrow.
Cilantro's,23,The food is fantastic   I am so happy I found this little gem   I have tried the carne guisada  menudo  barbacoa  fajitas  and pozole   All excellent   The prices are very reasonable for Austin.  Lunch special is  4.99.
Cilantro's,24,For lunch  order the tacos doblados  or however the hell it s spelled. Chicken  guac  and sour cream mixed together and then  uh  fried. Greasy  hot  tasty. The other stuff on the menu is fine  but the doblados are the best. The best  I say.  The salsa is supposed to be warm. Sometimes it isn t  which it makes it less good. It s still good  just less good. When it s warm it s very good.   Also  sometimes  the iced tea has  as my grandmother would say  a  wang  to it. Not wang as in penis  but a funky rancid taste. Like it s old and has been sitting in the metal pot for a long time. This has happened twice in twelve visits or so. Math nerds can do the percentages.
Cilantro's,25,Prices were cheap. Portions were small  maybe we are just big eaters   But what got me was the  6.99 large guacamole. You would expect a large bowl of guac. What we got was a large bowl of shredded iceberg lettuce with avocado mixed in. No spice. No flavor. We tried it but we won t be back. Service was friendly and we didn t have to wait long.
Cilantro's,26,Cilantro s has some of the best breakfast tacos.  I would say they could hold their own in a head to head breakfast taco fight with anybody else in town.   It s a really small place in a strip mall that you could drive by and miss if your not paying attention.  They even have an award from the Chronicle on the wall for  Best place to eat Salsa in a Dingy Strip Mall.   I ve had most of the lunch and dinner specials they have  and all of them are priced well.  The fajitas are good  but not so great that you HAVE to tell your friends.  This is a nice little place to eat at.  The owners are always in there working   very friendly people.  I also really like their salsa.
Cilantro's,27,Cilantro s is a cute little dive.  I ve only been there for breakfast.  Their tacos are pretty good and stuffed full.  I d prefer it if they made their own flour tortillas  but other than that  I have no complaints.  The staff is very friendly  and it s pretty cheap.  It s a good place to go for a quick  decent breakfast.
Cilantro's,28,This place is deceptively great. Just looking at it  you wouldn t think it would amount to much as the storefront is small and it s located in a sort of run down plaza. I haven t ever had a plate so I can t speak to those  but I order the tacos to go a few times a week.   The breakfast tacos are solid and fairly cheap  although most do not come with cheese so you have to pay a bit extra. The sausage and egg and bacon and egg are good  although they do tend to skimp a bit on the meat. However  it works out because the substantial amount of egg seems to soak up all the delicious sausage bacon flavor making the taco both tasty and filling. For lunch I recommend the Al Pastor and Barbacoa.  The customer service is superb  the ladies behind the counter have always been extremely polite and seem genuinely happy to have my business.
Cilantro's,29,I just live a mile or so from restaurant and have always wanted to try it but never stopped in till other day and was kinda disappointed the day i went I was way hungover from nite b4 entered and was only customer in place sat down ordered the lady there was very nice service was good but while I was eating my chips  amp  salsa I noticed how warm hot it was in rest. and asked about the ac she apoligzed and told me the ac was out and that she could comp my beverages ok what ever that was nice of her but couldn t really enjoy my food it was to hot in there  food was allright  Ill try them again maybe just hope the ac is working next time
Cilantro's,30,I have been twice now to cilantro s and it is acceptable but not the greatest. Let me tell u why...first of all  apparently i am a creature of habit because both times i went it was a friday and the lunch special was enchiladas. The first time i had the enchiladas  i ordered cheese because that is the first thing i get at any traditional tex mex restaurant  unfortunately they brought me beef  which i am not the biggest fan of but i ate anyway and they were pretty good  came with rice and beans of course  and only 4.99 till 2pm. That part i liked  also atmosphere was great  felt like a small traditional taqueria. Second time i went  i ordered breakfast tacos  which is great to be able to order tacos any time of the day but not that impressed with the quality of the taco. Overall i say it s a good neighborhood joint  but i wouldn t go out of your way to eat here
Cilantro's,31,Basically  it s a great place to eat good food cheap. The environment won t remind you of the Four Seasons so as long as you don t expect that  you won t leave disappointed. We had the fajita combo plate. The beef  amp  chicken was tender  amp  flavorful. The guacamole  amp  veggies were good as well. I rarely have it due to it being super sweet  but the horchata was off the hook  The meal was under  10 each. Actually  we liked the food  amp  price so much that the fiance  amp  I decided to have them cater our wedding.
Cilantro's,32,This review is for service  not food.  The breakfast tacos here are good  but they have lost my business due to service.  They charged me for an item that they didn t put in my to go sack.  I called to inform them of this when I got home.  The lady on the phone  Liz  said  We did forget to add it. No problem  just come back next time and I ll remember to give it to you at no charge since you ve already paid for it.   Given  I didn t come back immediately  but I m a regular customer.  When I reminded them of said item on my next visit they didn t remember  including Liz  and didn t honor what they initially said.  Even if they really didn t remember  I m a regular customer and the item was just a few dollars.  So...basically they ve lost my business for life in order to save a few dollars.  To quote Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman... Big mistake. Big. Huge. I have to go shopping now. 
Cilantro's,33,This is a little hole in the wall dive kinda place. It is in a little shopping center with what used to be a convenience store that no longer sells gas but still has the pumps. It is tiny. 4-5 booths and maybe 6 tables. Friendly staff and good service.   The wife and I found this little jewel a last summer. We got our complimentary chips and salsa  they will charge you for a second basket of chips but the prices are so cheap on the entrees it really doesn t matter . Nice flavor with a slow and pleasant build to heat on the salsa. Won t hurt you but it will let you know it is there.  I ordered the Mole Chicken Enchiladas. I have been back many times and I have never ordered anything else  nor am I likely to. More on that later. First thing my wife and I do is take a bite of the re-fried beans. Pure magic. Never have I been so impressed by a plate of beans in my entire life. Most places I have been the rice and beans are just a side used as a filler. These beans could have taken center stage in and of themselves. Smokey bacony bites of heaven. Whenever and whatever my last mean is I hope it includes these beans.   In my experience Mole is one of those dishes that is either done right or not at all. I have not experienced any  middle ground. That being said Cilantro s mole is top notch. If you don t know what mole is it is chocolate sauce  the first time it was described to me I did not think it could possibly be good but my curiosity got the best of me thankfully . It can be spicy  I think traditionally it is supposed to be spicy  but Cilantro s is not spicy although it is still fantastic.   Great food  great prices and good service  what more could you want 
Cilantro's,34,Another place to hit on my infrequent trips to south Austin.  I googed mexican restaurants near my destination and this one popped up.  Not much to look at  it s yet another of those places stuffed into a little shopping center.  Basic seating  no frills.  The woman waiting tables was friendly enough  though.  As with previous excursions to new Mexican breakfast places  I got a chicharron taco.  It wasn t better than my favorite place  but it made a decent effort to try.  Also the al pastor is good  not heavy on the sauce like some places I ve been.  And the tacos are decently filled  not skimpy.  It s only a block or two off my path up Manchaca  so I don t have to travel out of my way.  Not a bad place altogether.  Hate to try to find a parking place during peak hours though.
Cilantro's,35,Excellent breakfast tacos. I am eagerly awaiting a chance to go back and try a lunch special 
Cilantro's,36,The girls at the counter have a lovely disposition and the food is good  If you want your best value   eat your breakfast tacos at the restaurant because to-go tacos are made smaller to fit in the bag. Good salsa as well 
Cilantro's,37,like this place. good  cheap  fast breakfast tacos
Cilantro's,38,This place is ok. Pretty Divey but cheap as cheap gets. Really hoped for better when I did eat there a few times. But food for dollar it was not too disappointing.  The breakfast tacos are actually pretty good standard.  Some things there....well they kind of have their own  who knows where they got that from  interpretation of the meal.  Outside of the typical food if they are unsure  they kind of  figger  and throw some cheese on it and bring it right out with smiles. Very nice polite people working there.
Chapuln Cantina,1,Awesome spot  Authentic Mexican food. No  it s not Tex-Mex  The taste and feel of the food is like being at a Mercado  farmers market.    I would come again  the price is cheaper compared to having to go to Mexico for the taste of its food.
Chapuln Cantina,2,Very enjoyable experience.   We sat at the bar  we originally had a reservation for a table but we prefer sitting at the bar. The service was very good  we got drinks  a starter  and entrees at a good pace  and never felt rushed.  The delfina cocktail  watermelon mezcal based  was awesome. We had guacamole with chicharrons  and my boyfriend got the crickets on the side  they were a little too salty for me. The guacamole was great.  I have a nut allergy so I couldn t have the mole negro or Colorado  the server was really helpful and brought out a list of all the ingredients in the moles so I could check. I got the shrimp in the green mole  the shrimp were cooked fabulously  cilantro rice  so good  the mole could have been a little silkier but the flavor was there.  The prices are a little high but that s South Congress for you. I would definitely go back  and try some of the platos fuertes  amp  tostadas next time.
Chapuln Cantina,3,Really disappointing. Went on Saturday and arrived just after they opened at noon. The place was empty  fair  since they d just opened.  We were offered a table outside and I said I d like the shadiest spot. ALL of the tables were open. The greeter offered us a table directly in the sun. I reiterated that we wanted at least partial shade. She seated us a a four top with partial shade. The manager sees this and BERATES the greeter for sitting two people at a 4 top.  We offer to move inside  and are reseated.   This place bills itself a the real deal upscale Mexican food. I ve had better guacamole at HEB. The yellow fin tostada was good  and the bone marrow appetizer was meh. Frustrating to have hot bone marrow delivered to the table then have to wait for the tortillas to arrive so you can eat it. I ordered a pork memela. What I got  two tiny  smaller than a small drink coaster  corn cakes with what appeared to be a chopped up pork chop. Most of it was inedible gristle and fat. Never got the side of beans I ordered. Husband got the steak. Prepared ok but way overpriced and nothing to write home about. Oddly  for an  authentic Mexican  restaurant  the steak came with a pile of French fries. Like  a pile the size of a newborn s head. Total bill for this disaster   101 before tip. Our server Bailey was the only bright spot. She was excellent.   Since this restaurant is associated with Vespaio  next door  and the former Enoteca  I really expected great things since those restaurants are  and were  pretty excellent. This place is a giant disappointment. From the incredibly rude manager berating staff  to the false claim that this is  authentic Mexican   the subpar food... not good at all. If you re looking for excellent food and service  try Comedor. Skip this disappointment.
Chapuln Cantina,4,Amazing selection of mescals  2 full pages   Great  attentive service by Bailey and the food was fantastic. Lots of options for smaller plates and tacos to share. My friend and I decided to try the Pescado Al Espazote  mahi mahi with a delicious fresh herb sauce and the most crispy potatoes I ve ever had  and the Mole Amarillo with roasted pork shoulder. The seasoning on the pork was umami-rich and crispy skin as well. The second dish was served with buttery cilantro rice and black beans. We can t wait to come back again and try more delicious dishes and cocktails.
Chapuln Cantina,5,We tried the Tu tano  Charred Bone Marrow  and it was by far the best dish we had that night. It s not that much food but the bone marrow just melts in your mouth like butter.  We also got Barbacoa de chivo  arrachera  and duck with mole. They re all very solid  but I wouldn t say they were amazing or super memorable. I definitely want to come back and try some other dishes that they have on the menu though.
Chapuln Cantina,6,Listen  I miss Enoteca too. I actually told the waiter  Michelada  who I highly recommend asking for  the second I got sited that this is my neighborhood and eneteca was on my top list so I had low expectations.  He walked us through the menu and gave us the best options  he made the whole experience a 10  The good news is the chef stayed the same  the waiters also  so the quality is still there  it just didn t make sense to Italian restaurants next door. Moving on to the food.  It s definitely an upscale Mexican restaurant.  The chips are served in tortadas that you cut yourself  and the queso fundido is excellent.  Then we shared one of the ttayuladas  Mexican pizza  with chorizo - good  but also not the thing I ll be craving again.   I don t love mole but the pork mole was excellent  so tender - definitely a must  That was also the most expensive part of our dinner  but I probably would only get that next time I come back.   The chocolate cake for dessert was delicious. Not just a simple chocolate cake  it had cayenne is it  very interesting combo   Overall  I recommend giving it a chance. It s an excellent upscale Mexican place and the food was high quality. For 3  we ended up sharing queso  2 dishes  dessert and had 4 margaritas  which were excellent  and paid  150 tips  so it s pricey  but also not unreasonable.  I would also check if they have a happy hour  that would be a great way to test it.  Pro-tip  - request  Michelada  as your waiter - make a reservation on Open table  so easy 
Chapuln Cantina,7,When this place first opened up  it had the buzz of the chicest of the chic and the hottest of the hot.  That flower has wilted.  5 30 on a Friday night and there are lots and lots of empty tables.  The place did fill up over time - but not the way the gangbuster places are doing out on the New East Side.  What is the issue   This place does not put very much on the table  quality wise or quantity wise - and they charge a lot for what they serve.  Chi chi touches do not hide indifferent food.  Instead of chips and dip they serve whole crispy tortillas wrapped in a napkin.  Well ou la la.  The chips  whole and circular rather than broken up and in a basket  still don t taste like much.  One salsa was hot and uninteresting. One salsa was sweet and undistinguished.   On most chips and salsa  I inhale the entire bowl.  I was just as happy to leave these.  Guacamole was standard fresh guacamole just as you can get in over a hundred other restaurants in town.  Queso fundido was its usual hard-to-eat wrestling-with-cheese-sticky-putty that you also get in over a hundred other restaurants in town.  My paloma was indifferent with unpleasant sips of whole granules of chili powder.  The shrimp cocktail was large and very good.  However  I am eating tomorrow at Ceviche Love out on 812 which serves an even better shrimp cocktail at a fraction of the price of Chapulin Cantina.         Overall  tourists who aren t going to leave Downtown Austin or the Soco area will be the primary beneficiaries of Chapulin Cantina.  Since tourists don t know the price of anything  they will happily overpay for food they think they can t get at home.  The room is pretty enough to give them nice selfies.  If you are an Austin resident  and you are lucky enough to have out of town visitors  take them to the real places where they can get the good stuff.  Your wallet will thank you.  If you are an out of town visitor - consult Yelp.  And seriously consider getting out of SOCO and Downtown.  Both BBQ and Mexican are better out of the tourist zone.  For elegant Mexican  and that romantic night to remember  try Fonda San Miguel.  For down-to-earth family Mexican  try El Secreto de Abuela.  For Barbecue  try Stiles Switch.  And for a ton of fun  try T-Loc s Mexican hot dog truck.  He does amazing burritos too .  And for Keep-Austin-Weird Mexican for bona fide Mexican nerds - try Chilakillers.  And for new bold daring Austin cooks go elegant - try Vixen s Wedding  Austin-Goa fusion  or Canje  Austin-Caribbean fusion   Did you notice I did not mention a single downtown or South Congress location   That is not accidental.  Get out and discover where the good food REALLY is.
Chapuln Cantina,8,Thanks very much to Gordy  our fantastic server  who was willing to brave the chilly patio with us and our pup. The queso fundito with champi ones and fresh tortillas were excellent as were our moles and barbacoa. Delightful service  great food  and due to the chill  the patio all to ourselves   We miss the former concept but will come back and keep trying the new one  especially the homages and other nods to Enoteca.
Chapuln Cantina,9,Came here for Austin Restaurant Week. They donate a portion of every meal to the Austin Food Bank.  I ordered the Chicken Milanese with pasta. By far the best dish at the table. Think Latin Chicken Parm.  It was delicious.  I m a sucker for good table chips and boy oh boy did they not disappoint. Great staff. Warm environment. I would definitely come back here.
Chapuln Cantina,10,Came for some appetizers  will be back to try entrees and mezcal cocktails  I recommend trying some of the tostadas and memelas.  The queso fundido tasted more like Tex-mex style queso... it was still good but not what I was expecting.   Definitely still miss Enoteca  but this place is a nice addition to south Congress.
Chapuln Cantina,11,this place was not it. i am mexican and it is so hard to find actual interior food in austin. so  my family and i were beyond excited when we saw a place that offers chapul n had opened up. despite the prices being incredibly high for seemingly regular food  we decided to give it a try with open hearts  i wish we did not.   the arroz frito appetizer was very bland. despite coming with mole and huitlacoche  there was little to no flavor. the tlayudas however  were very tasty. they were gigantic and the huitlacoche especially was incredibly delicious. my only complaint is the chapul nes were very very small and salty. nonetheless  i really did enjoy the tlayudas.   the food is not why i m giving this place one star  it was the employees. the server was standoffish and ignored us until my family said something. when we tried to order in spanish  because the items are in spanish  she did not understand then gave us attitude. do not give mexican people attitude for ordering in spanish  at a mexican restaurant  where the menu is in spanish  be serious.   later  one of the managers decided to come and speak to us asking how we enjoyed everything. he was pleasant until he decided to explain all the food we ate in a very condescending tone  despite my family saying we already knew what all of this was. when my mother spoke about what our version of this was like in mexico he was quick to cut her off and say that  well this is from oaxaca so it s different . right  but if you wanna talk about food don t start getting stuffy when we talk about what we know and experienced. la morena que estaba trabajando detr s de la bar era la persona m s dulce de all .   overall  this is a perfect example of what happens when white people try to open authentic restaurants of different and cultures  it just doesn t work. si quieres aut ntica comida oaxaque a  solo ve al north lamar
Chapuln Cantina,12,I keep coming back since first visiting. Yes  it is a niche restaurant offering non  Austin Mexican  food but those who know and appreciate Oaxacan and other interior Mexican cuisine will love it.   Each time we ve gone these are my go-tos   - queso fundido - huitlacoche risotto balls - Tostada de at n   tostada de camar n  - tlayuda con tasajo  quintessential Oaxaca dish  - chicken with mole negro  I know the menu is intimidating if you re unfamiliar but hopefully these recommendations make choosing easier    As far as drinks  look  just get an agua fresca with a serving of one of their many mezcals on the side  Can t go wrong 
Chapuln Cantina,13,Good food but grossly overpriced  for what it took to leave there content and full  we could ve gone elsewhere and had a fancier meal. Portions are small so don t come hungry  it s more of a tapas place if we re being honest. Everything tasted good  but it wasn t over-the-top amazing to warrant the price.  We had the following  - Yellowfin tostada  blue corn tortilla was nice and crispy  but also oily  - Rice balls  I ve had better at an Italian restaurant  - bone marrow  you get such a small amount  but the homemade tortillas were great  - ceviche  a more decent portion  but meh  - wagyu memelas  again  oily  - chips and salsa  the chips are hidden in a napkin holder thing  we didn t even notice them until we were leaving  the green sauce was great   - good drinks  they have lots of mezcal  Meh  I don t see a need to go back.
Chapuln Cantina,14,Meh  I m disappointed. We loved Enoteca  but were excited to try a new concept here.  While the decor was nice and the service was fairly good  the food was pretty lousy. I think the only dish I enjoyed was the queso fundido  who doesn t like melted cheese though    The octopus was served chopped up in a cold sauce that had a funky flavor. It wasn t necessarily bad  but didn t taste great.  The pork had that musky pig flavor you get sometimes when they either didn t cook it property and or didnt marinate season it enough. Was okay  but not worth the almost  70 it cost.  The chips were served as tostadas so you have to break them up yourself to dip them. Not a big deal  but just sort of weird.  Hope they can improve it  but for now I won t be back anytime soon.  Also agree with the other review regarding servers trying to pick up dishes before we were done. You need to ask customers if they are through before you pick up plates.
Chapuln Cantina,15,I was pleasantly surprise by the food. The food was such good quality with lots of flavor. I will be back to try something else on their menu. The decor was also  cute and fit the ambiance very well.
Chapuln Cantina,16,Without question  the worst service I have ever had in any restaurant at any time anywhere in the world.   We arrived without a reservation and all the tables were full but the bar was almost empty with perhaps two people on one end of a long bar with many seats. We sat down and waited. And waited to be noticed. The bartender kept doing whatever she was doing  but never approached us to asked us if we wanted a drink. Finally  when she was close enough to talk to  I asked if we could order some drinks. She obliged  and the drinks arrived A few minutes later. we never received the menus for drinks or food  so I requested them. We figured out what we wanted fairly quickly  but the bartender never came back over to ask us if we were ready to order. Finally I told her when she was close again  that we were ready to order some food. She took the order. The food arrive in not too long of a time  brought by someone from the kitchen.  The food was decent  not necessarily stellar. The bar started to fill up a little bit more. Two women that sat next to us who had the same problem with the service  waiting to order drinks  waiting to order food. Wow. Finally  I got the bartenders attention again to request a check  which arrived incorrectly. I think it was someone else s check. We then got ours and waited to get the final bill to sign. I left only a 10  tip which is half of what I normally do. The bartender didn t deserve that but  people still have to eat  right   So  it really doesn t matter the quality of the food at this point because the service was so unenjoyable  the food could not compensate for that.
Chapuln Cantina,17,Great food and service  We had guacamole   Mahi tacos and steak tacos. Highly recommend all  Great atmosphere and staff 
Chapuln Cantina,18,ReAly good flavor of food lots of mezcal options the ceviche cenizo was really good had a mole sauce not spicy at all. We had the puerco de Chamorro with mole sauce on top was very savory filling of flavor . Could of been cooked longer  it did not fall of bone was a little tough.otherwise
Chapuln Cantina,19,I m giving Chapulin 5 stars for food and service. Both me and my friend felt the ambiance didn t match the food  we felt it could be more elevated without being overly pretentious. With that said  our food was really delicious   We went for Austin restaurant week. I had the Yellow Fin Tuna Tostada as my appetizer  4 5   the Milanesa De Pollo Y Pasta for my entree  5 5  waitress also recommended    and the Chocolate Cake with Fig Ice Cream for dessert  4 5 . The service was amazing  5 5  and our waitress was helpful with drink suggestions and food suggestions. A manager came by to make sure we were enjoying our meal. I will say that the portions were medium to large. I have enough Milanesa De Pollo for two additional meals. I noted mixed reviews for this restaurant prior to our dinner  but glad we selected this restaurant for restaurant week.  I would love to go back for Happy Hour small plates. I prefer authentic Mexican cuisine and feel this restaurant is a great addition to the neighborhood.
Chapuln Cantina,20,What a disappointment  The menu looks very inventive and creative  everything looks to be authentically Oaxacan. However  we found a food to be totally bland which is the complete opposite of what this type of cuisine should be. Everything felt like it was missing salt or acid. And absolutely  insanely ridiculously overpriced for the quality of food. Both of our meats were overdone and tough. We went to get tacos from the local taco truck after our meal. A shame because the menu shows real promise and the interior is so cute 
Chapuln Cantina,21,Great service  vibe and ambition.... You can tell this place is new and working things out. Happy to pay for great food but this was not good whatsoever    Just really bland food. I Just went tonight.... Not sure if the chef is tasting what is going out  Maybe it was just an off night  All food at our table was universally unseasoned and inconsistently cooked. Fundamentals were missing  and flavors were portio sizes need reevaluating. Chorizo was overcooked. The tortillas were meant to be crispy and they were soggy.   We had 4 drinks and one was great  one tasted like rubbing alcohol. I suppose that is my fault for ordering vodka at a mezcal house. Reminded me of everclear jungle juice from college.  Maybe this place is just inconsistent and others are seeing things we didn t  All I know is  chef and bartenders need to know  Salt matters  And this place had little  Server was great  manager offered to comp the meal  asked for feedback  which we politely declined.   Hopefully back of house will improve.  Lots of respect for a business trying to get up on their feet  hope they can turn it around ... Hope to be back with a refined menu  and same high quality service.
Chapuln Cantina,22,OK. Fist ask yourself did S. Congress REALLY need yet another TexMexish eatery   And did it ever need  21 taco s   Me thinks not
Chapuln Cantina,23,I loved Enoteca  and I had hoped that this place would be more on par with my experiences there  but I would rate it as  okay.  It was a bit overpriced  but I did taste some delicious Mezcal  was impressed at the size of the ceviche  and my partner enjoyed his carne guisada tacos.
Chapuln Cantina,24,Best mole in town  top 5 margaritas  what else do you want  Stop being so unreasonable  No  I m totally calm  you re the one getting worked up  Just go there already 
Chapuln Cantina,25,Food and service was wonderful. We liked the new festive ambiance. Can t wait to go back 
Chapuln Cantina,26,Chapulin Cantina has beautiful  vibrant  authentic decor inside  great food  and friendly staff. My favorites were the pork mole and crispy rice balls. And it is located in the fun and fabulous South Congress  so bonus there.
Chapuln Cantina,27,Had been looking forward to trying this place but left disappointed. Based on these reviews it seems like I m not the only one who found the food extremely bland. We ordered several margaritas and they were not great. They tasted like sweet and sour with zero tequila. Guacamole was shockingly bad with no lime juice or seasoning whatsoever. We didn t even finish it  left after appetizers and decided to go elsewhere for entrees. Sadly I wont be back.
Chapuln Cantina,28,Food was cold and flavorless.really over priced for what they serve  seemed like our server was in a hurry and kept taking things away while we were still working on it .
Chapuln Cantina,29,We had a wonderful experience   Love love love the food     We had tlayudas and reminded us of our last trip to Puerto Escondido in Oaxaca    Cocktails Oh my  We had el chavo   Mezcal cocktail    Salsas were spicy and service was Amazing
