El Super Taco 3,1,Staying in a local hotel and there s not many other options so I decided to check it out.  I got 3 tacos  pastor  asada  and chicken  and they were all excellent.  Definitely a no frills joint and they don t accept credit cards  but well worth the stop.  No chips and guac or anything like that  but if you re in the mood for some solid tacos then definitely check it out.
El Super Taco 3,2,Delicious food truck on East Riverside  It shares the lot with a Honduran food truck and a building that is a hair salon.   I was at a work site nearby and decided to drop in for a quick lunch. I ordered two tacos  carnitas and al pastor  and a veggie sopes.   I really love sopes so any time I see them on a menu  I make sure to order it. While they usually sell sopes in a plate of three  the lady said she could make just one for me. The corn bottom on the sopes was perfectly crisp and you can hold it and eat it. it was a great vessel for the beans  crema  avocado and queso fresco  YUM   The two tacos I had the traditional way with corn tortillas and cilantro onion. The carnitas was well seasoned and had good crunchy bits. The pastor could ve used a smidge more pineapple  but both were great.   The green and red salsa they had were muy pica    Two tacos   sopes was less than  8  What a steal   Give them a try if you re in the neighborhood.
Pupuseria La Bendicion,1,Really great pupusas. They assemble and cook them when you order so don t expect it to be a quick grab and go... but you can expect the pupusas to be delicious. Friendly service and they are generous with their sauces and curtido.
Taqueria Guerrero,1,From walk up menu was expansive and it was nice to have so many options coming from a food truck   The service was great and friendly  anything I asked for they would response with  absolutely  and with a smile.  I got the quesabrria tacos  torta with bisteak and jam n  and an elote. Quesabrria was amazing the meat was soft the cheese was melty and the cozume was hot and juicy. The torta was huge and delicious it was so warm it wilted the lettuce a bit and the flavor was there. And the elote was amazing the Chile was exactly was it should be Chile molido not hot sauce like Valentina and they were very generous with the toppings.  I will definitely be back     Sorry my pics aren t better we were hungry
Chevron,1,I stopped here for gas and ended up having lunch  This convenience store has a full size kitchen  spacious and very clean. The shrimp tacos are a must  I ordered a latte to go which they prepared fresh on the spot. Delicious  Looking forward to making a stop there next time I go through Austin.
La Chilnguita #2,1,Food was amazing. Really enjoyed the food and had an amazing time. They have a wide variety of dishes. The person attending is really nice.
El Xolo Tacos,1,Their food truck came to our neighborhood. Tried their miga tacos. Oh my. So GOOD  It s authentic and just perfect. Def getting my breakfast tacos from this place now and on 
El Xolo Tacos,2,Sorry to leave a 2 star but the breakfast tacos were really bad. Swimming in old grease  room temperature  hard burnt coffee-ground like chorizo in one  another with the tortilla rock solid  another with the fillings very dry. It seemed like whoever made them focused on nothing but slopping together the ingredients as fast as possible without any regard to things that actually make food good  especially when you re around one of the top foodie cities of the US  Austin TX. Do not recommend.
Burrito Mexicano,1,Stopped by on the way home from work for a PERFECT sope. She sells huaraches  tacos  burritos  of course   you name it. Really high quality meal  and super nice owner. One of my new favs.
Villanueva Taco Truck,1,The food was to die for. The service was great  I have a lot of tacos and I was surprised with the quality of the food
Villanueva Taco Truck,2,This little food truck is located on Dessau Lane directly across from Dessau Elementary school. They are parked in the Dessau mini Mart parking lot. It appears they ve been here for sometime and probably have a lot of regular customers. The truck itself looks pretty worn and at this time the menu under the order window has no prices. They do have some outdoor seating under an awning. I ordered two sausage and egg and two beef fajita breakfast tacos which came to just under  10. They were both made fresh to order with fresh onions and cilantro.  They do give you two sauces with your order which are not your typical tex-mex salsa. The tacos themselves were actually quite savory. They do offer a full breakfast plate with rice and beans. The average wait time is about five minutes to get your order should you order at the window. Basically it s a nice spot to pick up some good breakfast tacos on your way to work.
Taco Cabana,1,If you don t love mexican food don t get in here. Your stomach don t love you
Taco Cabana,2,This location was super rude. guy taking ordes was an idiot. Not only is there inside is not open but when I ask to place an order for 2 separate people they refused to do so and said that I would have to go back through the drive-through once again for my 2nd order which ended up being almost a mile long the 2nd time around   at my lunch hour  Then when I ask for street tacos on flower tortillas they refuse to give it to me or charge me extra for it when all the other cabanas never have a problem with it. This taco cabana should be shut down or completely restaffed. Customer should be treated with respect.
Taco Cabana,3,The first and second time I went there in a week I ordered steer tacos. I found the meat in the tacos had more grossly then descent meat. Our tacos were not warmed up at all even though I reguested tto have them wormed up
Taco Cabana,4,Things can be slow here so be prepared to wait. Unlike the Chick-Fil-A next door  this Taco Cabana take a bit longer most times around. The food is usually pretty decent  although on several occasions  the staff have missed parts of my order. Accuracy could be improved. Pricing is okay for a campus eatery but a bit higher than normal. Wide selection of salsas at the side bar.
Taco Cabana,5,All I really get here are their breakfast tacos because I can customize it at the toppings bar. I do enjoy their myriad of salsas which always spice up their bland food.   The quality of their chicken is sub par so the only think I m comfortable eating without feeling at any sort of danger are their tacos.   The positive thing is that there is never a line so if I was ever starving  I would have a quick bee to the front of the line to grab something to control my hunger.
Taco Cabana,6,Pretty bland food. They don t let you customize. Avoid this place. Even though it s cheap  it s not worth it.
Taco Cabana,7,I usually don t have much of an issue with this place  I d probably typically give it 3 stars  but today I ordered shredded chicken soft cheese tacos and I got quite a surprise. After I added the lettuce and guacamole salad they give on the side for plate orders  I took a bite and some of the lettuce fell off. When I went to spoon it back onto my taco I noticed there was something black on it...  There was a bug on my food. I threw it all away and just left. I had to go to class soon  but I ll definitely NEVER eat at this location again. I recommend you do the same.
Taco Cabana,8,Horrible guac    I got the plate and the gauc was almost frozen. It was really  really cold. Ruined my lunch basically since there s no microwaves around .
Taco Cabana,9,I normally love getting Taco Cabana s bean  amp  cheese tacos for a quick breakfast. I have been eating them ever since high school  but this time it was different. I don t know if they changed the recipe or what  but the beans were INCREDIBLY salty. My roommates even agreed that there was too much salt. I had to scrape off 90  of the beans off the tacos in order to not taste how salty they were. I m so disappointed because there is a taco shop closer to my apartment and I could ve gone there instead of all the way to this place only to get salty food.
Taco Cabana,10,Looked it up to see if they were still open and it said they close at 1 am. After I ve parked and  walking to the door person inside waves that it is closed. There were people inside in line and the doors are still open. It was 10 till midnight.  Guess taco Cabanna doesn t like money
Taco Cabana,11,I ve never given a one star review to anything before but unfortunately  Taco Cabana has earned it. The  tacos  dont really taste like tacos. They just have this weird rubbery processed taste. I am not above chain food fast food but Taco Cabana seems to have lost their propensity for southern flavor somewhere along the assembly line.
Taco Cabana,12,Don t trust the official hours. Students working it will tell you it is closed 30 minutes before closing. What a joke.
Taco Cabana,13,I guess I ve gotten spoiled by actual good tacos but I just ate the worst soft chicken taco and bean and cheese taco of my life  The chicken was very mushy  greasy and didn t even taste like chicken. The beans were very salty. I hadn t eaten at all so I forced myself to eat them since I didn t want to waste  3. I wouldn t have even fed these to a homeless person they were that bad  Never will make this mistake again 
Taco Cabana,14,By far the worst option around. I have ordered twice from this place. Both times the food tasted bland  saved by salsa bar  and was not substantial. Service is terrible  as expected from an on-campus resto.  I don t even want to bother going on  just skip it.
Jack in the Box,1,I got eggs and bacon  I needed something keto. The manager here rocked it. His attitude was amazing. Thank you Jack in the Box 
Jack in the Box,2,Long Review but worth the READ .MY family and I went to this Jack in the box location.  Ed Bluestein   I ordered a three-piece combo for 8.49 and was charged  8 for a three-piece chicken strip. When I got to the counter and realized this part of my order was wrong  I told the girl at the window she had my order wrong. She went to get the manager who I explained she discrepancy to. After giving them the chicken strips back I explained that I would like to pay the difference and get the combo which was  0.49 more. They close the window then come back to me tell me there s no way that I can pay the difference and I would have to pay the additional price for the Fry s and drinks. Make it make sense. I told him I m not going to do that and I would just prefer to get my money back. They close the window again and came back and told me I had two choices to either pay additionally for the fries and drink or to take my food or get nothing. At this point I tell him I don t think so and just to give me my money back. He tells me he can t do that. I then tell him I don t know what you have to do but give me my money back he tells me that I am yelling at him not going to yell at him and slams the window. I get out of my car knock on the window and ask for my refund.  I see them behind the glass getting upset bc a line has formed and I m not moving. They begin yelling screaming profanity and saying other obscene things telling eachother they don t know why I haven t moved I m not going to get my refund. Then a pregnant Mexican lady comes from the back telling the guy I had just talked to how he doesn t have to deal with me calling me all kinds of things out of my name b       and whores f this and f that and how she will whoop my a  . I m looking at her like  what      I m like say bro just run me my money back. She then tells me to f myself and to come through the window  she then punches me. Immediately a black lady gets in between us  through the drive-thru window now mind you  pleading with me .. ma am please don t hit her she s pregnant. I m like I don t care what she is she just hit me.  The black lady says   I know she did ma am and I m sorry  she shouldn t have did that. We are going to go give you you re refund. Just please don t hit the lady back. She s pregnant.  I ask her   Did you see she just assaulted me   She said   Yes.  Then the pregnant lady comes back to the window still wanting to fight.  Talking all kinds of crazy. The black lady ends up having to hold her back cuz she s acting a fool like she wants to come and fight me through the window. SMH By this time my best friend who was behind me in another car with my children has jumped out her car also my daughter jumped out the car. She is crying. They re hysterica.l My mother-in-law is traumatize and I in utter shock. No one can believe this chick REALLY JUST PUNCHED ME THROUGH THE WINDOW. I look back the line is full. People are hanging out windows asking questions. The scene is chaos. My friend is on the phone with police with 311. I look at my daughter and see straight fear in her eyes   which instantly snaps me into another mode. I tell them I will be contacting corporate and tell they lady who punched me she s dumb bc she s pregnant and is going to definitely lose her job behind her actions.I  just get my car and drive off.  I ve contacted corporate a countless times. I can never get a response. The next day  I go back and speak to a manager. I asked  to see the permit of the restaurant. Denied. She stated it was expired and she couldn t let me take pictures of it bc they were waiting on a new one. Convenient. I asked for the owners and higher supervisor number. Denied. I asked to and get information for whom I could speak to about the incident that happened the night before. No One. I asked her names of the employees that work there she gives me these names. Pablo. Erica. Erica. But who is who  She doesn t know. Imagine that. I explain to her the incident  she immediately gets weird. Again   she doesn t let me come in and see the permit of the restaurant stating that it s expired and she can t let me see it because they re waiting on new ones. She then called her  her manager who told her to tell me to get any information I needed  have my lawyer get it.  To me all of this is just sad. There was no I m sorry ma am for your inconvenience or I m sorry ma am that we still didn t refund you your money. I m sorry ma am that my employee assaulted you in front of your children because they were too incompetent to manipulate the machine and give you your refund. What happened to the customer is always right  I thank God for growth today. That s all I have to say about that.
Jack in the Box,3,I ordered my food through Uber Eats and I the person picking up my food didn t receive my drink and I had ordered the loaded tiny tacos and my tiny tacos I got were loaded
Jack in the Box,4,if i could give no stars i would. rude disrespectful of our money tried to steal. told me items were out yet still charged and i had to say something they didnt offer money back        they dont wash their hands. went at 3am and theyre very dense at that time. day or night shift they dont need to be in customer services. fake gm never calls back. ever. he played on my phone did not leave a vm. they allow this bald headed behavior. trash.
Jack in the Box,5,I just left that place and please heed my warning- DO NOT SPEND MONEY HERE. Nose picking  employees with attitude  long wait times  odd hours being closed  and disgusting. I live literally right by this place so I ve had a few experiences here and every time I m absolutely disappointed.   This time was definitely my last  I literally waited at the speaker for over 7 min before they greeted me even though only one car was in front of me. I ended up waiting 15 minutes total before getting to the window.   ... then I get up to the window  and the guy answers and tells me they don t have Apple Pay even though it says on the website they do. As he explains that oh well  nothing they can do for me after waiting making me wait 15 minutes  then he starts to literally pick his nose in front of me and their manager who is watching too just shrugs her shoulders and laughs as she turns away.   I really hope the owners read this because their staff is disgusting and they always have attitude  completely lacking basic customer service skills- I ve tried coming here a few times and every time I get attitude and the food is always trash. But now after seeing what I saw tonight- I will never try again  I don t care if it s the only place by my house.   Also sometimes they will be randomly closed during operation hours while having a full staff inside. I m pretty sure they do this when they don t feel like working.   Don t come here.
Jack in the Box,6,Took about 30 minutes to get through the drive through  about 5 cars in front of me . I only ordered a burger and fries combo and they somehow managed to get my order completely wrong.
Jack in the Box,7,They will straight  Lie to you and say they re not open. When the sign says and the website says 247.. The person in front of me had to honk to get service  From the female that didn t want to do nothing.
Jack in the Box,8,I m stuck in the drive thru with ppl honking bc of the wait. Makes no since. Fast food ain t what it used to be. I hope no one gets out their car  might be a fight.  And after all this I have to pay for my food. Go figure  Should have went elsewhere.
Jack in the Box,9,Only one person working drive through  took 5 minutes of us sitting at the speaker before we could order. Then when we got to the window to get our food I saw an employee handling my food with no gloves on and another employee incorrectly wearing a mask allowing her nose to stick out  and when I asked for avocado lime sauce the employee didn t even check before she said they were out. Definitely going to Sonic next time.
Jack in the Box,10,Came here with my family ordered the 12. My husband got the same. His was fine but mine was cold the cheewce was ice cold not melting at all it tasted old and felt weird. Asked for another one. These people put it in the microwave. They dont bring it to the table im yelled at from the counter and could not grab it at the time because my baby was asleep on me. So i had to wait for my husband to come back from the bathroom. The geniuses put my sandwich in the microwave  Still had a bite taken out of it the bread was now soggy and all the veggies were limp. Worthless location.
Jack in the Box,11,Terrible service via drive thru  making customers wait a really long time at the speaker without saying anything.   I ordered the buttery bacon and Swiss burger   and got just a berger without cheese and no bacon instead  I also order curly fries and they were cold and hard burnt.  Avoid this location  is damn joke.
Jack in the Box,12,Terrible service    they never have anything   They gave me a coke with no ice and I asked the guy if I could have some ice and he rudely said  we don t have any  like really how do you not have ice  they re always just so lazy   
Jack in the Box,13,Went to get a Sausage extreme and found large pieces of egg shells Very noticeable and they still served it with shells Tacky place and people  
Jack in the Box,14,Had a craving for breakfast since they advertise having breakfast all day and was told they don t serve breakfast at this time. I also tried calling before to ask and they didn t not answer there phone.
Jack in the Box,15,Open 24 7 but somehow their ice cream machine late night is always   just not working right now  which I m pretty sure is code for they just aren t working right now. Don t waste your time.
Jack in the Box,16,Jack in the box must be struggling. I ve tried the drive thru at this 24 hour location a few times and they ve been inconsistently been  closed  or  had some excuse as to why they weren t able to serve anyone.
Jack in the Box,17,cashier was rude when i asked if i could make another order she said they only do 1 per car which is weird because they ve always been able to take multiple orders separate orders . she was not following covid guidelines no mask or gloves when handling food do not come here  .
Jack in the Box,18,Ordered a southwest salad and got ranch instead of SOUTHWEST for the sauce and didn t even get my croutons I mean what would I have expected it was late at night which is the shift that doesn t really care ...  Also wished the managers would show the employees good customer service...
Jack in the Box,19,They were slammed and had a lot of problems because of that  like no time to clean tables and people taking orders that weren t theirs   but the food was good and they made the best of a bad situation.
Jack in the Box,20,One of the employees who was working drive through on 10 02 19   11 30pm  reused a brown bag that already had trash in it from a previous customer  and gave it to a new customer. She also seemed like she didn t wanna be there because she was giving me attitude and rushing me to order. Find another job if you re not happy with fast food. Simple.
Jack in the Box,21,I love Jack in the Box.  This location range from a 1 star cant get anything right  slow  poorly staffed mess to a 4 star excellent fast food experience. They cant seem to hang on to the good staff though.
Jack in the Box,22,i went through their drive through they just leave you waiting for hours there not until i honked they asked me in a very unprofecianl way what i wanted to order then the cashier at the window was very rude and disrespectful not only to me but to the costumer behind me i ve been here 3 times and for the past 3 times has a cashier at the window been very rude i do not recomend at all
Jack in the Box,23,I ordered  10 worth of tacos and they had me waiting for 30 min then Finally tell me that they no longer have tacos they have to defrost them ... gave me my money back without even asking if I wanted to wait then gave me a soda for an apology I guess   The place was dirty anyways don t wanna eat there ever again
Jack in the Box,24,Oh my I have to wait 20 min longer evertime. It s gross to the bathrooms are always smelling really bad can smell out of the bathroom nothing is ever put up or rotated it s a mess a smells bad or like weed so nasty really I have never had such bad service and I just want 20 churros that take 2 min to cook 20-30 min to get its rediculis I m surprised they are still open
Jack in the Box,25,If you feel like sitting in your car while the Jack in the Box crew gets high  then this is your place. 45 minutes for a taco is normal - with little to no apologies. When the drive thru window opens  and a cloud of smoke billows out  you might as well put your car in park because the entire team will forget about you and your order until you honk. Classy joint.
Jack in the Box,26,Just went by on my way home after a long day. Storm on the way so trying to just grab food and get home before it hits...I ordered 2 things...2. Value nugget and a large seasoned curly fry. How hard is that  I got the nuggets  claps  and a value fry  sigh . I even said  a large seasoned curly fry . Not big curly fries or curly fry that somehow sounds like value fry. People make mistakes but damn. She repeated it back and we ended up going over it a 2nd time. Still it was even entered on receipt as value fry. Am I speaking English 
Jack in the Box,27,The food is great... IF you can get them to get your order right the first time. They ve messed up my order 3 separate times and by no means was it complicated. A number 8  13 and 8 tacos. Instead  I got a number 8 and a pita. No tacos and no chicken strips.
Jack in the Box,28,To start  im only giving this crap hole one star because I cant give it zero  Every interaction at this jack n the box is like pulling teeth every second order out of three has either wrong food or drink with it and god forbid to go back to make it right they make you feel like YOU made your burger wrong. On top of bad customer service you get hit up from bums while waiting in the drive through line. All in all I was surprised there is not one review for this place and all of them bad. Stay away
Olél Taco Food Truck,1,The barbacoa and pastor are soooo good and melt in your mouth.  2.50 a taco and totally worth it. Definitely need to try this place.
Como dijo la Abuela pancha,1,Tastiest food truck in north Austin  Conveniently located off parmer ln and Lamar behind the Velasco. They have a nice set up with umbrellas if you want to dine in. I tried discada  bistek  pastor  barbacoa and her costilla de puerto plate and I fell in love with all of them  She hand naked corn tortillas too   I also ordered a Guava  mango and lemonade agua fresca and they are all made to order from REAL fruit  Very affordable and big menu to select from. I was already full but the owner showed me the Cuban torta and I will definitely be back to try that  Owner is the sweetest  support your local businesses   Comida muy deliciosa  Est n localizados en la intersecci n de Parmer ln y Lamar detr s de la gasolinera Velasco. Tienen mesas con sombrillas por si gustan comer ah . Probe tacos de discada  barbacoa  pastor y bistek y todos estuvieron muy deliciosos  en tortillas de ma z hechas a mano. Tambi n ordene aguas frescas de guayaba  mango y una limonada  todas las aguas est n echas al orden. El men  tiene variedad y los precios son muy buenos  La due a del lugar es muy amable  si est n en el area deben tratar su comida   Cash only  Solo toman effectivo
Jack in the Box,1,They don t serve the whole menu 24hrs like every other Jack in a box does. I went there at 1030am tried to get a burger and they only serving breakfast
Jack in the Box,2,Came by at 3 35 today.  No cars in the drive thru.  After sitting several minutes  get  I ll be with you in a moment.   Must be nice to have no customers and not need any to stay open.  Drive off to someone that wanted my order.
Jack in the Box,3,With a line of ten cars at the drive through  they won t ask the lead vehicle to pull up and everyone has been stuck for over 15 minutes.  This is horrible service.
Jack in the Box,4,5pm on a Sunday and  we re closed unless you have a DoorDash  wtf ... just do us a favor and close all your locations because they are all terrible.
Jack in the Box,5,Wish I could give it 0 stars   Seriously took my order and didn t follow any of it. Lettuce tomatoes on Al burgers when I said non on ALL   Mini churros didn t even have sugar on them so taste Super Bland  S the chicken on my sandwich was so fried it was Hard to tear apart even with my teeth    We all know Jack ain t the best when it comes to employees but we are still paying customers  
Jack in the Box,6,I know I didn t ordered burnt curly fries... smh... I knew I should of gone to Starbucks instead
Jack in the Box,7,Okay. We have used this place several times  that is when the 24 hour Jack in the box is actually open. The last 3 times we tried they were closed. Which is why their app doesn t work. So just to name a few issues. They make you go around to the back of the drive thru to make your food. Idk if that has changed. The app is twice as much as in the store. So today the person was so rude and literally spelled the word CLOSED. When said  closed   back to the person. I mean it s normal to confirm a 24 hour store is closed. But that was the last straw. Won t give it another try EVER.
Jack in the Box,8,It s 10 34 AM on a Saturday morning and the doors are locked. I tried to go to the drive-through and they are only serving breakfast. Since when does Jack-in-the-Box only serve breakfast  Never stopping here again  There is a P. Terry s just a block away so I won t have to. Oh  and I just looked at their schedule and they re open. Guess what   All they serve is burgers   
Jack in the Box,9,This place sucks. Horrible employees. They always say they are closed because they don t want to work. I don t understand why they won t just close down. Do not recommend
Jack in the Box,10,Service and availability at this location are nothing short of ridiculous. Too many horrible experiences to even begin doing it justice. I like JIB in general compared to their competitors and I STILL wish this location would close. It s a complete waste of real estate.
Jack in the Box,11,They never have anything in stock and they always make us wait for nothing. A constant problem with their system. In conclusion don t come here  save your time and go to another Jack.
Jack in the Box,12,Back in February we went to this jack in the box and they said they weren t taking orders  it was a weekday around 4pm and they said it was bc they were on lunch break.... Okay  We gave it another try about a month later for dessert and of course  they said they couldn t make anything with ice cream.  Now tonight we re very hungry after a long day at work so we go through the drive through at 11pm and they said they re closed    Posted hrs say it s open til mid-night. And as we re driving off we look in and no ones doing anything but standing around.
Jack in the Box,13,I came all the way from Copperas Cove to pick up friend from airport. I ordered sourdough Jack and large fries. I only got sourdough Jack and no fries. I went back and let them know that burger was cold and stale and that I didn t get fries. They give me another sourdough Jack that I asked to be fresh cooked  and was cold and stale breaf again  and again  no fries. Their lobby is closed so I have to go thru the drive thru for the 3rd time. I won t do it  considering my friend is already off his plane and waiting.  This place sucks  Not somewhere to get a quick bite while waiting on flight to come in. Our nearest JIB is Killeen  and their freshness is far better than this place.
Jack in the Box,14,Pulled up and ordered one burger and they didn t have it apparently. so I said ok how bout this one Oh no we don t have that one either and then asked for churros and they don t have that either what about iced coffee  no we don t have that  is your shake machine working   Nope. So settled for less and got something I didn t want cause I was hungry and waited 30 minutes for my food with no attention by the drive thru other than to collect payment while they were playing on their phones and playing around the kitchen.
Jack in the Box,15,Worst jack in the box ever there hasn t been one time they haven t messed up my order not one and then have the worst attitude when you tell them is wrong like how are you going to be rude when y all messed up my food not once but 3 times 
Jack in the Box,16,Went by at 11 30 and it was closed.. Hours say they close at midnight. Light were on as if they were inside but not taking orders
Jack in the Box,17,This place has been buttcheeks since it opened  COVID did not bring this place  a href   redir url http 3A 2F 2Fdown.it amp s 73af71776a344478ed2d5d760372da735da2e3601e29a9578c2ef653d44d4046  rel  nofollow  target  _blank  down.it  a  was already down. Slow and unprofessional service  cold food outta the drive through and extremely long wait times even with 1 or 2 cars in the drive through. Only reason I go here every once in a LONG while is because it s so close to me. I regret it every time.. damn munchies   
Jack in the Box,18,It s some of the best fast food out there. Fresh produce and big  juicy burgers. Better than Burger King or McDonald s. This location has consistently good service.
Jack in the Box,19,I came to order an order of five regular tacos the lady on the speaker tells me  the tacos are frozen I can t get you any  what does that even mean don t they have a fryer I worked in fast food for five years Everything starts off frozen
Jack in the Box,20,I have been to this location about 4 times since it s so close to my work and every order I have received it has been wrong  I mean every order and I don t figure it out until I m at work and it s too late to return it. So disappointed because I kept giving them the an opportunity to redeem themselves however that has not been the case. This last visit will be the last. I don t know what it takes to be more clearer.
Jack in the Box,21,I was at this location this morning  on 1 28 2020 around 12 50AM. It took about 10-15 minutes for me to get  my food. The guy in front of me had a really big order  but regardless I wish this location had more staff to assist with the graveyard crew. I ordered 6 tacos and a small fry. I made this order in advance via the mobile app. When I finally made it to the drive thru  I got my food within 1 minute or so. I have been to the other locations in Austin around the same time and it has never taken me that long for me to get  my food. This location needs to do better  however I applaud them for getting my orders right when I do come. This is my 3rd  time coming to this location. I m not sure if it ll be my last.  This location is close to my house.
Jack in the Box,22,Waited 10 minutes in the drive thru never even got to order I had to hop the curb  it was insanely slow.
Jack in the Box,23,Dont usually stop here  but I was running late to work and didn t get a chance to eat breakfast so I decided to stop by and get a breakfast croissant. I got the whole meal  paid and left. As soon as I got to work I took out my croissant with my hash brown and my hash brown looked like if someone had bitten into it already  I was very disappointed since I hadn t eaten and was looking forward to eating that but now that I saw that I looked like it had been touched  I don t even want eat any of my meal that I paid for anymore  I should ve double checked as soon as I got my order through the drive through but I didn t 
Jack in the Box,24,This location has slowly become my absolute favorite   Huge shoutout to Jose for the amazing recommendations   This man deserves to be employee of the month   He also has such a lovely speaking voice  
Taco Bell,1,I enjoyed my first ever tacos there. Will be back to a Taco Bell soon to try something else. I do recommend this location.
Taco Bell,2,I really hate leaving bad reviews  but when you re treated ugly with an unwanted shity attitude by an employee  it s a huge NO  NO  especially if I m the customer  because of customers like me  they get a paycheck. I came in and placed my order on the tablet  went up to the counter  an employee  Adriana E.  was standing in front of the counter. I asked her if she could give me the cups for my drinks. And with a shity  ugly attitude she responded     I can t because I m already leaving.   I said   ok  I ll ask someone else. 
Taco Bell,3,Do not ever go here. Bad food  even worse customer service and bugs. Run. Fast as you can.
Taco Bell,4,Ordered my food take out  it was warm  great flavors. Great honestly for fast burritos.
Taco Bell,5,Constantly closed early. Second time in a row I ve had to cancel my order because they do not clearly indicate their hours.
Taco Bell,6,Twice I have went to this location and ordered the same thing  2 quesalupas with steak  and both times I ve been charged for steak and given the gross beef.  Twice I ve tried to call and both times I have gotten a recording saying they were busy.   I need a refund or some sort of replacement for those orders and for the staff to just pay attention. It wasn t that difficult of an order with special instructions.  Put the right meat in the meal.
Taco Bell,7,For the past week they have been saying they are closed when it s only 3pm. Someone needs to get this place in check. Fire those employees and get new ones.
Taco Bell,8,Do not order from this location on north Lamar  Every time i order through UberEats they either cancel my order or they turn the delivery drivers away   very unprofessional employees  Get paid to do NOTHING. GHETTO 
Taco Bell,9,Went there last night at 10pm and waited ten minutes at the drive thru until I called them. Didn t pick up the first time but I they had two cars parked outside  lights on  and so I called again and got an answer. They said they were closed but I had already ordered online. They told me that they were still closed and they weren t going to make my food.
Taco Bell,10,Fix your hours or stay open until your supposed to  no reason to close 3hrs early but have all the lights on.
Taco Bell,11,Fix your online hours. This is filler text because Yelp sucks and is a poorly designed product.
Taco Bell,12,Honestly.... just dont go to this location. Messy  slow  forgetful       Food was nasty more importantly
Taco Bell,13,This place is clean inside  the customer service was great and the tacos were filling. One of the best Taco Bell experience I ve had in a while.  I definitely recommend coming here if you re craving Taco Bell or an affordable snack. I got 3 regular tacos and I was full after.
Taco Bell,14,They say 1 Am  close    but really it s like 12 I ain t sorry I work late and get off late that s your job WORK YOUR DAM HOURS   
Taco Bell,15,I have been here multiple times and about 20  of the time they get the order right. For Example  today I got 2 cheesy gordita crunches  with no lettuce  and a beefy Fritos burrito and a shredded mini chicken and I actually got 2 cheesy gordita crunches with lettuce and 2 beefy Fritos. I wouldn t care about the lettuce if I got what I actually ordered. Too add onto how bad it is  I was the only person in the store and there was no one in the drive thru so they weren t even busy. Terrible location  go somewhere else if you want Taco Bell.
Taco Bell,16,I stopped by today to get some food with a coworker  since we were in a hurry we decided to stop by this location. Let me start by saying the customer service is really bad. I work a customer service job too and I understand sometimes we are having a bad day  but as soon as I pulled up the guy sounded like he just did not want to talk to me. He yelled when I asked him to repeat what he had said since the intercom was cutting in and out  it was broken of course . I was nice to him and told him that I did not need a drink when he asked he then proceeded to yell at me and tell me  then you just want regular tacos why ask for this order if you don t want a drink    I really wanted to drive off the location at that moment but I had already wasted time and if I didn t get this I wouldn t have lunch for the day so I put up with his attitude and him cutting me off most of the time. As soon as we pulled up to the window he just gave me a mean look and took my card  I asked if I could have guac on the side and boy did it look like I had just asked him something extremely difficult. We waited there for a while and finally got our food  I asked my friend to check the bag because I had a pretty good feeling our food wasn t going to be right. And of course  I didn t get the correct order and neither did my friend. I got regular tacos instead of supreme and she had a chicken quesadilla instead of steak. With no guac. I would 100  recommend another location besides this one  overall the whole staff just looks like the hate working there.
Taco Bell,17,This place looks great. But  yeah it is substandard. I was harassed by the very same cashier who had rung up my order. I was using the restroom after dining and right before  leaving. She got angry that I wanted to make sure to take care of my businesses.  I don t think I am coming back here any time soon. Having a restroom for your own paying customers is a mandatory health and safety requirement. This is not something which this respective fast food worker gets to decide. Does not work like that. Not at all.
Taco Bell,18,Ok  so we were in a hurry and figured  fuck it  we would go to Taco Bell.  Taco Bell is a place where even though we write bad reviews  we still end up going there.  In any event  we ordered some food thru the drive thru and it was seriously taking 5-8 min per order which is odd for a fast food joint.  We get up to the window and ask the lady how long it is going to be for the order.  They hadn t even made it  and when she told me another 5-7 min  I asked for the credit card back and drove off.  It seems that she was messing around with one of the cooks and someone was distracting someone  as their process was severely slowed down by this.  The food is good  but the service at this particular Taco Bell is below Sub par.  Seriously I am done with this place.        My wife called up Taco Bell and the manager there remembered the order and offered at any time to get it for free.  Talk about add insult to injury.  Do they not even consider that the amount the food cost was not their fall from grace   Seriously  its like they think that offering something for free will make things better.  How about take some fucking responsibility for your service and provide me with what you are gonna do to make sure it get s better.  Give me a fucking game plan or something.  Not some god damned coupon for free food.  What the fuck do we look like   In either event  as you can tell by what I wrote  we declined that offer.
Taco Bell,19,This has a new look...but it the same as old.....a lot of homeless causing and fighting..begging inside restraut .....food is taco bell....so its OK...only go if u need too
Taco Bell,20,This location has some residence street beggars. Every time we come here they are inside hitting people for money.  I don t know if this is another way they are making money or the district managers  is not aware of the problem. We really have to be tire of other restaurants to come here. Just  a href   redir url http 3A 2F 2Fgot.my amp s 6a5c63ad48197be80f5448d14cb83f6e4ac79a257f6fc0c5ee80622191d57585  rel  nofollow  target  _blank  got.my  a  food and got the wrong food. Manager sits there and check price to charge me more . I just said to the manager just get me the right food i order please.  he said is going to be more let me check. I had a recipt in my hand and he did nto even notice. I don t care if is more just like to get my food. He got an attitude for 10 cents. Hahahaha. and i order the only thing i like here a wrap. i can say i will try to stay away from this location and recomend everybody not to come here at all is not worth it. plus the tables are always dirty.
Jack in the Box,1, open 24 hours  when y all want  once in a blue moon  when y all come out with a new item  i ve never seen it. put your correct closing hours if your this short staffed so customers aren t wasting time and gas
Jack in the Box,2,Wish I could give zero stars. Theres a homeless camp in the parking lot. Creepy men living in tents and peeing behind the dumpster. Someone should ask them why they haven removed  vagrants from their property.
Jack in the Box,3,STAY AWAY - The admitted to serving old eggs.    My pregnant daughter bought food today from this place  they served her gray eggs.  When she went back to complain an employee and the manager responded non chalant - oh those are just old eggs.  They knowingly serve expired gray eggs     Seriously   There are food regulations and standards to follow.  We are keeping an eye on her to see if any food poisoning symptoms occur  hopefully not. I advised she try to throw it up as she ate some eggs before realizing they were gray   This is ridiculous - this should not be tolerated.    STAY AWAY - they knowingly serve bad food to the public.
Jack in the Box,4,I ve come here often over the last year as I work close and don t have time to eat lunch usually so pick up something fast. Food is as fine as expected to its typically ALWAYS hard to understand anyone in the Drive Thru. Such heavy accents that they have messed up my order a few times because it doesn t come on the screen and they say what I think was right but ended up wrong.  Please make sure customers can understand the people working for you as it s frustrating for all.
Jack in the Box,5,This is the order I received today 09 05 19.  This is the worst meal  I had to throw away.
Jack in the Box,6,It s taken me three years to get to the point where I m willing to leave a bad review. This place is just awful  and it s unfortunately located just up the street from my house. I no longer order tacos or fries here because you can tell that they re not fresh. Nothing like paying for stale  lukewarm food  and then waiting ten minutes to get it with one car in front of you at the drive through. The drive through is often closed at night despite this being a 24 hour location  and the customer service ranges from decent to mostly non-existent. I now drive out of my way to the location on Burnet Anderson which is a a 180 from this awful place.
Jack in the Box,7,Employees didn t use gloves for making my order and my sweet tea was way off. It was overly sweet at first and a few drinks in it instantly became bitter
Jack in the Box,8,My mom and I ordered food here yesterday and they were taking forever    It was like 6PM and we waited for tacos and curly fries for a good while. Yet while we waited one of the workers was on her phone with gloves on  while her other co-worker was trying to bust her butt to keep the drive-thru going. A manager walked by her and didnt say a thing.
Jack in the Box,9,always mess up order and are sometimes  closed  even though people are inside working.. it s supposedly 24 hours
Jack in the Box,10,Well  Jack me up again  look I live a simple life and do not eat out much but how could I pass up two crescents for  3.00 so here we go again   I never go through drive through because you are guaranteed they will screw up the order 60  of the time. So I always go into the restaurant and order. I ordered 1ea Sausage Crescent and 1ea Supreme Crescent  went to work ate the Supreme Crescent and was full so I put the other one in the fridge for the next morning. Get to work and heat up my breakfast open it up and  Surprise  it s another supreme     What  Jacks me up  is that there is NO Customer Service any more in America. People just do not care or listen to each other. Maybe the food  heater upper  was texting or maybe they  she  did ent understand English whatever it was was messed up. I called the store and spoke to the Assistant Manager Adrianna  she was grateful I called  I hope she was sincere  and did give me a new order whenever I come in next. This is GREAT customer Service and that s why I give her store a three star rating.  Just thought you should know 
Jack in the Box,11,Went thru drive thru.  My order wrong. Had to remind worker about giving my drink.  I drive home 3 blocks away. Only to notice not all my food is in bag.   It s almost mid night I had to drive back to get rest of my food.  Not cool at all.  Manager on duty.  Please do a better job.  U were the one who gave me the order wrong.
Jack in the Box,12,Very disappointed in this establishment very unclean and didn t give us the correct order and they over charged us and to make it right the counter person manager gave us more cups for drinks we already paid for drinks so where s the value    not in touch with there business
Jack in the Box,13,No. I will never eat here again. This place rushed my food for no reason because nobody was in the line at all. It was midnight and the lady taking the order was rushing us to do that as well. The food had me sick as hell and it was horrible.
Jack in the Box,14,Always delicioso  Bacon and cheddar potatoes would be my meal of choice if I were on death row and it was the last food I would ever eat  with buttermilk of course.
Jack in the Box,15,this jack in the box sucks. more often than not - seriously  most times - i go there in the middle of the night to get some grub  and they re closed. either i don t see anybody through the windows  or whoever s at the drive thru speaker will tell me that they re closed for the moment. this happens ALL THE TIME. but sure enough  the hours listed at the drive thru window state that they re open 24 hrs. if they say they re open 24 hours  then damnit  i don t want to waste my time leaving my house and burning gas just to find out the people there don t feel like taking any orders.
Taqueria Alayna's,1,Literally  a hole in the wall  an interstice between a laundromat and a check cashing place. It s amazing that the source of such goodness takes up such a small footprint.  Buy delicious  greasy tacos for very low prices   1.75 for the breakfast tacos and  2 for the others. The convenience store next door sells cold soft drinks like Crush and Big Red.  As I said  this is just a window inside a wall  so it certainly it does not provide conventional seating. But if you go with some friends  you can stake out a parking spot and form a circle inside it  letting the wholesome grease dripping from your tacos mix with the machine grease deposited on the concrete by previous visitors  cars. A prime combination.
Taqueria Alayna's,2,wow dude. grease. lots and lots of grease. so the thing is  alayna s is cool. i mean it s a window and a table. there s something exciting about that. also it is cheap and you get a TON of food. the problem is that i had to spend a day recovering from the fact that most of what i ate could be used to power a bio-diesel van on a trek across europe. just too much grease  however  i do have a bad stomach.  i wanted to give this two and a half stars  but that s not possible. 
Takavron,1,This company was the best  Their tacos are delicious   Real Mexican food  no Tex-Mex food. They showed up ahead of time and stayed a little later to feed those that came late to our party.  Eric and his team was super kind and went out of their way to make this is a special event.  Everyone had fun and talked about wanting to do this again.  They cooked the best pastor  carnitas  bistec  piratas and gringas tacos and they were huge tacos     I highly recommend them.   Esta empresa es la mejor  Sus tacos son deliciosos     Real Comida mexicana no Tex-Mex. Llegaron temprano  antes de la hora que acordamos y se quedaron un poco de m s tiempo para atender a las personas que llegaron tarde a la fiesta. Eric y su equipo fueron s per amables y dieron todo para hacer un evento muy especial para nosotros. Todos la pasaron muy bien y dec an que quer an hacer un evento as  de nuevo. Los tacos son se pastos  carnitas  bistec  piratas y gringas  Y est n s per bien servidos  Son lo mejor   S per recomendados 
Takavron,2,I stumbled upon this truck last month with Thing Two when she went ice skating at The Crossover. This truck was located at the back of The Crossover in-between two other food trucks.   Thing Two ordered the nachos at the suggestion of another customer who was raving about the order he picked up. After we ordered  it took about 5 minutes for us to get our order. The nachos were heavier on the cheeses than on the carnitas. The hefty cheese took away from the carnitas which was unfortunate. Overall  this was on okay execution of nachos but not ones that I would seek out in the future.    8.50 before tip
Takavron,3,If you venture north of Austin off 183  you ll find this really cool spot called Field House. Inside Field House is a good little taco truck that serves up big flavor. If you live in Texas you have to know your taco spots and I m happy I tried this one. Here s what I had   Pirata - Good amount of sirloin steak  cooked well with onions and cheese on a flour tortilla. This was the second best of what I had.  El Capitan- This is the one  If you get anything on this menu  get this  Of all the tacos I tried on the menu  this one stole the show  The shredded pork melts in your mouth. Paired with cheese on a flour tortilla. This was taco heaven   Chicken taco- Underwhelmed with this one. Flavor was lacking and it was just ok.  Gringa taco- Standard pastor meat on a flour tortilla. Nothing stood out about this one.   Price was higher than what I like for 1 taco   7-8 . Standing in line also took a while  then the wait was quite long but the food was good. Overall  worth a try if you re in the area. The atmosphere is definitely worth it as Field House bar is cool.
Takavron,4,Takavron was recommend to me by the owner of The Crossover  Eric Perardi and I have to say it is a great choice. Last time I came here and saw Eric and Allocious there and I ate with them. Again  great food  great friends  always leads to great conversation.  We talked about how great all the tacos are and that we really wished they had a fish taco. Eric told me that Nicole and Rachel have amazing fish tacos and I should come over to their house one night and try them out. Allocious added that his wife s fish taco was always dry no matter what she did. I told him she just needed to cook it less so it d stay juicy. He just laughed. However  I told Eric that my wife and I would be up for a dinner party. He said they hold upside down pineapple football parties every Sunday. My wife and I are going to bring our world-famous pineapple upside-down cake. We can t wait   Thanks Takavron for having awesome tacos. How about a fish taco 
Takavron,5,Prices are a bit high and make Torchy s Tacos seem like a great deal. I best they re paying out-the-rear rental rates to Perardi who then skims some of that money off the top to pay for his drugs and girlfriends and swinger parties with his ex-wife. The tacos themselves are nothing to write home about. This place is just here to seperate all the California transplants from their money while lining Eric s pockets.  If the tacos were  4 piece or less  I d give this place 5 stars.
Takavron,6,1 of 2 Food trucks at The Crossover.   Kinda pricey but the atmosphere is bougie chic for Leander  Sirloin is chopped to a great size but it s rather dry and not marinated enough.   Pastor was a hearty portion and good flavor. It was verging on the texture of chorizo.   The nachos had a great cheese ratio.   I d go back if I m here  but wouldn t drive here just for the food.
Takavron,7,Nachos al pastor for the win  Best value and most delicious offering at the Crossover.
Takavron,8,Ate Takavron outside of a brewery  and it was a great experience. Food was excellent  and we ordered the al pastor  veggie  and gringa tacos and they were well made. Would highly recommended the gringa and al pastor tacos  because they were well flavored and cooked to perfection  I think I wish the tacos were a little bit more filled  and for the price I was off out at the total. But i also felt that the ingredients   and especially the meat was very fresh. The texture of the Gringa was excellent with the crunch of the cheese on the tortilla. Overall great spot 
Takavron,9,This should not even have any stars. I had better tacos   7 per tacos is ridiculous. Their tacos are below average  nothing special about it. They may have to bring their price down to what it should be.
Takavron,10,I had these tacos at Rentch brewery on The 4th of July and i can confidently say these were the best tacos I ve ever had  and I ve lived in Texas my entire life. I don t usually leave Yelp reviews but these tacos are worth traveling for 
Takavron,11,Got the pastor tacos and chips with queso. Since we ve moved to Texas 2 years ago  these are the first tacos we ve had where we thought  finally  REAL TACOS.  Tex-mex has its place but real Mexican style tacos are few and far between out here  and Takavron crushed it   
Takavron,12,Absolutely wonderful  Noticed the truck here in Georgetown earlier in the week and made it a point to make my way here today Saturday... They were out of their sirloin so I went with the Pastor which was oh so good     Thanking you all for feeding us here in Georgetown 
Takavron,13,Authentic Mexican tacos  they lack some taste and grill but still good non of the less. Not worth the  4.50 each though  Their chips and queso is great and you have to get  Really nice staff and would rate higher but the price and taste definitely had to bring it down.
Takavron,14,Great tacos  great beer  and great service  Josh made me the pirata and gringa tacos when they were parked at Barking Armadillo. Absolutely incredible  Excited to try the nachos next time  they looked amazing
ZIKI,1,Great spot on UT Campus  right next to the PMA    FOOD  it s great  flavorful  and and all-around well stationed bowl. It s consistent in flavor  but is a smidge pricey. It is a wonderful option to have on campus and a greatly appreciated food truck    Very nice staff  tip whenever you can   Cheers
ZIKI,2,Such a convenient location right outside of the EER. The ordering system was also super convenient to build your own bowl and add your preferred ingredients. However  they only allowed 1-2 toppings which was annoying as the bowl was pretty expensive    17  considering the portion sizes and other similar options  halal carts  cava  etc . It also tasted quite bland. The only  flavor  I could taste in the entire bowl was from the pickled olives. The only thing I liked was that all the packaging was compostable and sustainable. I d only order from here again if I need food near the EER and don t have much time to go elsewhere.
Tacos al Chile,1,This adorable  women-owned taco truck was parked outside my apartment complex recently  but their regular location is off North Lamar  I tried a chicken and an al pastor street taco   3 each  and the portion was great for the price  I also tried their new dragonfruit pineapple mango agua fresca  and it was so refreshing on a hot Texas day  Very Instagram-esque too 
Mary's Tacos,1,Mary s Tacos is just a block away from my usual taco truck  but I m glad I decided to give it a try.  I went with the pastor  barbacoa  and a bistec tacos for a late night meal. The tacos were served with lime slices  a salt packet  and little containers of a orangey-red salsa  amp  a creamy green salsa. Since the corn tortillas are handmade  I had all my tacos on corn tortillas. The tortillas were pliable  soft  and not overwhelmingly corn-y - the perfect taco vehicle.  From best to worst  Barbacoa - juicy  dripping   tender and lightly seasoned  I thought this was perfect. Bistec - A little more toothsome chewy  also lightly  amp  simply seasoned.  Pastor - relatively dry and saltier.. I d get these at another truck and skip here.
TAQUERIA  ELITA,1,After walking past this truck 100 times  I finally took the time to look it up on Yelp and I found nothing  So I had to find out for myself. I stopped by at about 9pm one night and it was empty. The truck is located in between a pawn shop and a big shopping center on Airport just past Rosewood. I ordered two tacos Fajita Pastor and Fajita Chicken both on flour tortillas. They were all out of Suadero  Brisket  and Chicharron  pork skin   so I ordered a beef tostada instead. I brought the food home  although there are benches and a seating area if you want to eat there. The tacos were solid and came with cilantro and onions. But the meat was a tad dry on both. The salsas were good too  but inconveniently came in plastic baggies instead of little plastic cups. There was a red smoky sauce and a tangy green avocado based sauce. Neither were as spicy as I would ve liked.   The tostada was what I really enjoyed. It was a decent size crispy corn tortilla topped with a thin layer of refried beans  cubed chunks of flavorful beef  lettuce  onions  creamy Mexican cheese  and some kind of sauce that was super flavorful. I would have taken a picture of it as well  but I accidentally turned the styrofoam container upside down upon opening it. It was no longer picture worthy.   I will be back to try their breakfast tacos and other plates. The lady working was very sweet and friendly.  They are open from 7am everyday until 11pm on weekdays  and 3am on weekends 
TAQUERIA  ELITA,2,The tacos aren t anything special and the salsas are SUPER watered down. Stingy with giving them out too.
La Catedral Del Marisco #3,1,This place is definitely in one of the hard places of access from 35.  My coworker and I decided to try this place out. I have to say one of the first places I have been to where you only get chips and salsa on the house for a Mexican restaurant. After that you have to pay for the next chips and salsa.  But don t worry you won t want more chips and salsa after you get your meal here. I was pretty full from just a lunch special. Their food filled me up.  The staff was friendly and took care of our drink needs in a timely manner.   Parking was definitely a breeze and it was not packed at all when we showed up during lunch.
La Catedral Del Marisco #3,2,Some waitresses are slow to serve  some customers get chips n salsa  others don t  the menu prices are different from when the bill comes  and they will not accommodate special request on a food item. Food is good but I would not go back.
La Catedral Del Marisco #3,3,The flush on one urinal wasn t working.  The other urinal was out of order as well.  In the dining room  one diner s old meal was sitting for twenty minutes uncleared.  The fish carcass and leavings were out there for everyone else to enjoy.  The staff passed the filthy table multiple times taking no action.  I ordered the 7 Mares Seafood soup.  The first spoonful of soup suggested that some of the seafood in my bowl was very very old.  I took a smaller more careful second spoonful.  The fish was old and questionable indeed.  I never took a third spoonful.  I was out of there.
La Catedral Del Marisco #3,4,Incredible enchiladas and great vibe and service if you are into low key dining - old ihop architecture and the smell of syrups from a past life are an added plus if you are all about that keep Austin weird vibe - went there two days in a row because it s that dank 
La Catedral Del Marisco #3,5,I have mixed feelings about this place. I ve been there 3 times in past month as I m working next door.  The first time I ordered a bacon cheese burger. It was pretty dang good. Liked it enough to order it again the second time. Was still very tasty. On their 3rd time  I figured I would order a Milanesa torta. Every Hispanic knows Milanesa is a very thin cut  breaded piece of BEEF that is pan fried. So what do I get.....a torta made with a thin cut of CHICKEN that is barely even breaded. Oh  and btw  they put refried beans on the torta without even mentioning on the menu. I dont like refried beans on my torta. Update your menu  I m not sure about the other food  but I would stay away from their milanesa tortas
La Catedral Del Marisco #3,6,Came in to watch a game and have dinner around 8 50 pm. First waitres told us that she didnt know how to change channel on tv 10 minutues later she told us that the truth was restaurant didnt have cable   we sat for about 10 minutes and had to ask twice for chips and salsa.  Never coming back during the week again
La Catedral Del Marisco #3,7,It s very nice inside the waiter can memorize the stuff but it takes way too long.The food is great too but it takes too long.
Pollo Rico #8,1,Possibly a new favorite. Open late and a  9 meal deal that can t be beat. Half chicken  tortillas  two sides  and a drink. I really don t see how I could ever finish all of that  so naturally that was 2 meals for me. Friendly worker when I stopped in. Only real negative I found was that they were doing cleaning and there was a STRONG ammonia smell while I was trying to eat. Also their online prices are not the same as in-store  so it looks like you can t order this  9 deal for delivery.
Pollo Rico #8,2,El joven que atiende no quiere hacer te porque se le queda y el due o le dijo que ya no hiciera  medio pollo  solo que sea de pelea no es medio pollo  maquina de sodas no tiene bebidas.
Pollo Rico #8,3,Jesus Christ.  Just went to get a togo order about 20 minutes ago. Watched a lady come out of the back with her mask down  she takes her time rubbing her eyes while taking my order and then went straight to bag my food without washing her hands.  Seriously  what the hell is going on  Did she never get the memo  That shit doesn t fly even without a pandemic going on outside.
Pollo Rico #8,4,Food was excellent but I ordered plantains as a side and got an order of beans. They actually refused to switch it out.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,1,The customer service was great at this location. They had several employees available. They were allowing you to come in and place your order as long as you wear a mask but there was no dining inside.  I decided to try the new cauliflower rice to lower the carb calories. It is two dollars extra. That was kind of a bummer as I feel like the pricing at chipotle is borderline high for the meal already. They were nearly out of black beans so I had pinto beans  I had fajita veggies  Pork  lettuce  sour cream  cheese  and some medium salsa. I also ordered a small guacamole and chips. I opted for the lemonade ginger drink. The fountain drinks which had been off-limits are now open.  The flavor of my burrito bowl was good  I will say that I could definitely taste the cabbagey flavor of the cauliflower rice. It wasn t necessarily a bad taste just a little bit strong. It did combine well with all the other ingredients. It was definitely plenty of food for a main meal.  Interestingly enough even though I could see big pieces of cilantro in the guacamole I couldn t taste it at all and I was extremely thankful for this because I dislike the flavor as it taste like soap to me so I m not really sure it was cilantro  The chips were fresh and good just the right amount of salt. I do wish you could get a half-and-half with half guacamole and half queso.  The reason I did not offer five stars is the lemon ginger drink that was available didn t taste like it was freshly made up so I don t know how long it had been sitting in that fountain dispenser and I wished I had gotten one of the other options  maybe one of the Agua Fresca s. I will do that next time or I will ask how fresh the lemonade style beverages are. I haven t been to Chipotle for a very long time and this was a good experience.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,2,Worst service I have gotten at chipotle. I asked for gluten free and she looked at me like she didn t care and grabbed the bowl w out doing anything to keep me safe. I had to ask her to at least change gloves after I saw her grab multiple flour tortillas and she looked annoyed but finally did. Then she gave me the weakest scoops. I only asked for rice  steak  barbacoa  and salsa. I had to ask for extra barbacoa bc the original amount was ridiculous. Only gave me like five pieces of steak and the tiniest barbacoa scoop. They are out of the salsa I even like. She just treated me like I was annoying the moment I said anything about gluten free. I have celiacs disease so it s a serious allergy and thought it s safe at chipotle. If you have an allergy avoid this location. They are horrible. And I just left there so it s Sunday at 640 pm. Whoever worked there then sucked. Not ok and it s discriminatory to treat me like crap just because I am allergic to gluten.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,3,Avoid at all cost you better off going literally anywhere else  The staff Al lsat around as a line built up and then I ordered a quesadilla and burrito. They told me to wait for the quesadilla  after making it they left it sit out while helping everyone else for 10 min realized and then when I asked them to make a new one since it was cold they just looked at me and handed me the quesadilla.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,4,Over here at the Southpark meadow location you have line workers that hate doing their job   its not my fault youre in control of a spoon . I don t appreciate the attitude and shaking the spoon for  15
Chipotle Mexican Grill,5,Chipotles are usually pretty consistent but the steak at this Chipotle was rock hard-chewy. Line was long and not moving fast.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,6,To say that this has been the Worst Chipotle I have been at is an understatement. As am placing my order for my family and I. I ask about the kids menu since I had my 3 kids with me. I asked it if it was possible to just get three regular tacos and the guy said it would be the same Price regardless of whether or not I wanted the sides.  the question was answered by a guy named Abraham that was not taking my order but kept butting in. Mind you am just asking a question.  I never say I didnt want the sides. Anyways  The other guy actually serving me proceeds to ask me what I would like for the Quesadillas to which i said steak. Once again here comes abraham and starts getting after the guy for over portioning the Quesadillas in front of not just my family but other customers as well. Then my bowl gets served but I was never asked about my three kids meals getting sides or fruit. I proceed to ask if i will get served the sides and he was like no because you said you didnt want them. I never did such thing. I asked if I could get my sides and he said no...Horrible customer service   
El Rapido,1,Right across the street from Emo s on the Red River entrance there s this nondescript little truck. You re not really sure if it s a taco truck until you walk up and notice the small menu  if you don t catch the smell of grease first or the tv inside the truck blaring Univision. Surrounded by hot dogs  bratwurst  and pizza  El Rapido holds its own with a decent taco selection. Beef  chicken  carne guisada  barbacoa  picadillo  even a veggie taco that was surprisingly good. Above average pico de gallo with a solid kick makes these tacos worth the 3 bucks a pop. This truck even sells raspas and Mexican coke as well as a few other food items that are not tacos.
Lylyâs Tacos,1,A run-down looking food truck behind the Chevron station at the NW corner of I-35 and E. Rundberg  the food delivered turned out much better than the look of the truck. The al pastor tacos with plenty of cilantro and onion were marinated nicely and diced small. It is not as tender as their neighbor s tacos at the no-name light blue truck on E. Rundberg  but still a good bite   but this truck serves a great big serving of meat that is guaranteed to fill you up.  2.00 on corn  or  2.50 on flour. Breakfast tacos are only  1.50 for 2 items before 11am  and  2.00 afterwards. The Bistek was tender  not spicy  but unfortunately the cheee served with it was without flavor  Mexican Asadero style. The corn tortillas were thick and hearty  and the flour were made from the same brand that I use  raw Guerro s brand  flipped until hot and cooked on the griddle.   This truck also offers gorditas  sopas and tortas of all sorts. The order-taker cook is supremely friendly and helpful through Spanish English translations.   Hint   you can ask to add avocado or cheese for free 
Taqueria Piedra Grande,1,Happened across this place driving around late at night looking for some food.  Of course  almost everyone in Austin suggests P. Terrys for burgers late night  but I decided to buck the trend and look for a taco place still open and come across this place across the street from another taco trailer.  The line for this one was way bigger  so I decided that all those people couldn t be wrong   The menu selection process is pretty simple  with what they have written on a board by the window.  Being a little cautious at first  I order only one lengua taco  one pastor  and one chicharrones.  You get a choice of flour or corn tortilla  but really  there is never a choice there  maize  babaaaay     I ask for cilantro and onion with lime to finish my taco  and am crazy happy ten minutes later after finishing up.  Nice crispness on the lengua from hitting the flattop a bit  and the chicharron is just tender porky goodness.  I get in line again because I m a fatty and end up ordering another round of those same three plus some barbacoa  tripa  and carnitas.  So dang good   
Taqueria Piedra Grande,2,I love tacos stands I think they are a great place to get good authentic tacos and tortas. However I wasn t a fan of this place. I ordered a torta and a few tacos and everything was very bland. The wait to receive my order was quite a long time. There are so many good tacos stands in Austin this one just didn t live up to the rest of them. I won t be returning and would suggest if your in the mood for good tacos go else where.
Taqueria Piedra Grande,3,severely disappointed. came here because taquerias 7 estrellas was closed so I ordered 11 tacos for  30 to go late at night. came home to see they gave me three tortas... stick to other places where they can get an order right.
Angelitos Tacos,1,Tacos are on the smaller side but still packs big flavor...solid strip of bacon is a plus and the chorizo is really good..both sauces are equally tasty....very friendly service and they got the tacos out quickly 
Angelitos Tacos,2,Wasn t special   fajita meat was very dry and cilantro was all stem basically.The only good thing about this place is the price.I think it was 2.50 for a fajita taco which isn t bad at all but the tacos aren t very good.
The Bakers Rack,1,The Bakers Rack comes to my work every Tuesday for lunch.  The food is good and for the right price.  The ladies that are running the truck - truly awesome  The absolute BEST customer service ever   I was craving some basic nachos and they made it the best I ve had.  Thank you ladies and I look forward to lunch on Tuesday   
The Bakers Rack,2,I didn t quite get the menu  with options of sliders to nachos to carnitas. I had never tried this place and the prices were cheap so I thought why not  I should have noticed everyone ordering carnitas  I opted on a burger slider and regular nachos. BIG MISTAKE  When I saw the nachos  I thought oh no  so I decided to add a little sauce to the top and the people in the truck made a comment about it  like that won t help  and they were right  It didn t  These nachos were comparable to what you get at a little league park. The burger was blah  but on a great bun  My suggestion is to definitely get the carnitas  and just because the workers are Hispanic  don t believe your food will be authentic  just sayin  blah.
The Bakers Rack,3,Only redeeming factor is the price. Food is nothing special. Any Joe Schmo can cook better than the food served at this truck. Also my total was  7. I paid with a  20 and received nothing but ones back when I could clearly see fives in the till. That s bullshit.
The Bakers Rack,4,Today was my second visit to The Bakers Rack truck  I did not have any cash on me so I verified before I ordered that they accept Credit cards because that was my only method of payment  I was advised that they did  I placed my order and as it turns out they were having issues with their credit card reader  after several failed attempts they politely said enjoy your lunch and comped my meal  even though I did not ask and advised of my willingness to wait a little longer for them to resolve the issue. The food is good  I just had a soft and crunchy taco but enjoyed them both  but the people are awesome. The sliders I had on my previous visit were good as well. I recommend them on quality of food  service and just the fact they are good people.
Karlita's Tacos,1,Karlita s is a great night taco option at Congress and Ben White. They have stools for elbowing right up to the truck  like it s a bar. Another uniqueness is they have discada tacos. I d never heard of that before  and it s a mix of pastor  chorizo and bistek. The tortillas aren t handmade  but they have a pickled haba ero and onion mix to make up for it. It was a solid enough taco for me to order another with barbacoa. Great choice.
El Tapatio,1,this place is great for austin  but as an overall taqueria in the states  theyre missing the burritos. not this baby tex mex crap where you get a mid size burrito  i m talking about muy grande tortillas. other than that  this place has it down. the meats  the tortillas  the chips  everything. inexpensive and high in quality. highly recommended if you re tires of the gringos in austin ruining mexican food.
La Llamarada,1,North Lamar in Austin has a long stretch of Mexican and Central American food trucks all located in the parking lots of other commercial establishments between 183 and Braker.  The largest cluster of trucks is in the parking lot of Marketplace Austin - a giant flea market that sells all sort of stuff. The biggest parking lot gets the biggest assortment of trucks.  The most popular individual trucks are elsewhere.  Just look for colored lights and crowds .  The Marketplace parking lot cluster is dwindling due to the drop in business from COVID-19.  But this is still a good place to get something to eat.  The trucks often have a special angle. One sells sausages  another pupusas.  La Llamarada is a straight middle of the road taco truck.  You have seen all of these menu items before at other taco trucks.  But the execution here is completely pleasant.  They do a superior chorizo  a pastor that is decent enough  the tortillas are excellent and they give you a nice grilled scallion on the side.  I would eat again at La Llamarada happily.  That said  there are a whole lot of food trucks on North Lamar to try.
Violet Sky Rooftop Lounge,1,It s too bad this place wasn t closer in town. While nothing about it is absolutely outstanding  everything was pleasant and appetizing. We came here for an election night party  and they paid attention to details. A live musician played  and took some requests. Stickers saying either  I voted  or  I drank  were provided. Flags were up for decoration. The bar made some clever politically-themed drinks. The food I tried was good but not show-stopping. The nachos needed more cheese. The elote dip was good but creamy enough that I had to stop myself for fear of eating an entire cup of mayo. The salsa was sweet and just a little spicy. My friends also enjoyed their tacos and flatbreads. The view was nice  but would have been more spectacular closer to the city.
Taco Flats,1,Good taco place at the Pitch. There are less menu items than their restaurant location.  They do have the frozen margarita on the menu  but not their regular house margarita. The chips and salsa are great and served with a big container of salsa that you can take home as well. The salsa is mild. Chips are seasoned well and very crispy. You can get your choice of mild or medium salsa with the tacos.
Jack in the Box,1,Not bad at all..new location just opened awhile back..really not a fan of fast food in general  but I am a fan of breakfast..service was good  food was hot   place is really clean..and the bang for you buck is on point..i would stop again  as it is on the way to work..
Jack in the Box,2,Place is shit. I am so irritated. Got there at 10 07 online it says they don t close until 12  i pull through the drive through abs some girl says we re closed and then doesn t say anything else. Signs outside even say 24 hours sooo     Wish I could give 0 stars honestly.  and i know they are supposed to be open because i tried getting uber eats and my driver also told me they were closed.
Jack in the Box,3,At 10 30 no one in sight  parking lot is clear. No signs saying they had to close early  hour sign still says drive through24hours  google says closes at12AM
Jack in the Box,4,Placed my order-at the window the cashier was not wearing gloves -along comes a coworker-tall thin-pants hanging below hiss ass-plaid underwear showing-he had no gloves on-poured a huge bucket of ice into the machine-pulled up his pants and walked away-cashier told me to park up front-they would bring my food-the tall guy brought me my food-I confronted him about no gloves-sign on the front door stated ALL employees wear gloves-he lies to me and said he took them off to bring my food-I called him on his lie and said I just saw him dealing with the ice-with NO gloves-he shrugged and walked away   11 bucks for a sandwich-onion rings and potential death  No thanks Jack  No more for me
Jack in the Box,5,Yo this place sucks.  Order a burger and they ll give you a taco. Order a fry and they ll give you a small sprite. When you tell them it s not what you ordered  they will get mad at you  tell you to park so they can bring food out to you...and then 30 mins later - give you a bag of napkins and a hot lettuce sandwich.  This place suuuuuucks.  Go to a different Jack.
Jack in the Box,6, Closed because I don t have a cook   Why no sign on the intercom  I waited 10 minutes before the person working there told us. Lights on and everything.
Jack in the Box,7,I went again last night around 2 30am - 3am   all the employees were outside and they said   sorry our system is down we are not taking any orders  so frustrating this happens all the time. something needs to be done. no one has reached out to me. they seriously need new workers or management. I will keep posing reviews every time im denied service.
Jack in the Box,8,Zero stars if I could. Today  5 3 2019  went to this location at 6 15am.  Doors were locked and no one answered in the drive-thru. Waited about 5 minutes  but still nothing.  All the lights were on in the building.  Sign on the door said the lobby was open from 6 00am - 10 00pm and that the drive thru was open 24 hours. Last week  I went there around the same time  but when I went to order in the drive-thru  they came on and said  We have no cook   and that was it... no good morning  no  sorry...   no nothing -- just the  We have no cook   click .
Jack in the Box,9,This place literally had one guy working the window and kitchen at the same time he would take a persons order and then wait till he was done to help the next person  that poor guy  this location is always understaffed and they run out of stuff all the time don t waist your time
Jack in the Box,10,It d be nice if when their shake machine is broken here  about 6 out of 10 times in my experience they re  not doing shakes at the moment   they put a sign out front so you don t get trapped in the drive thru for 20 min  there s no escape from this drive thru once you re in     because their service is insanely slow. Or don t have shakes on your menu if you can t make them 60  of the time 
TaquerÃ­a La Luna,1,Really good tacos. They re a little small so 3 tacos should fill you up. Get the birria tacos they re really good. The shrimp and bacon taco and the ham egg and cheese taco are my favorite. I wish they had sides tho  rice  amp  beans  and chips and queso maybe. And guac. Their sauces r really yummy too. And they give you a lot
Amorcito Taqueria 2,1,Located inside the gas station with some friendly service..they have indoor seating as well..tacos were super fresh and hot..Chorizo  Egg and Cheese all around...spicy sauce was really good..was in and out quick as we are road tripping today  
El Buen Sazon Michoacano,1,Tried two bacon egg cheese and two potato egg cheese breakfast tacos.  Both were really good and was happy to see that they didn t skimp on the bacon.  Bacon was chopped up into the egg but it tasted fine.  The potato and egg cheese was also delicious  nice chunks of potatoes.  We asked for green and red salsa  both were good but the verde was my favorite  although it was hotter  that s the way I like it. My only critique was that I thought  2.50 for each taco was a bit much for what we got in the way of filling.  They weren t under-filled but for the size amount I felt  1.75 would have been a more fair price.  But the taste helped make up for that. Very limited English spoken but we muddled through just fine.
El Buen Sazon Michoacano,2,I came to buy  soup the other day 15  only for it to be all water and skin they didn t put any vegetables in there and it literally tasted like water  I wasn t going to write a bad review but they were rude the whole time and when I went to order they saw me and didn t take me they made me wait like 10 minutes and they didn t have have people   I 100  do not recommend this shitty place
Taqueria La Chiapaneca,1,The chicken fajita burrito was amazing. Will definitely be back to try all of the tacos.
Taqueria La Chiapaneca,2,Great Tacos Bistec Asada and Chicarron. Freshly made Tortillas full o Quite Flavorful Meat. Cook from Chipas  MX. I will be back for more o these Delicious Tacos  Dr Wiley Coyote SFO... Located in Chevron William Cannon   Brodie. Hours 8-8 pm closed Sunday
Taqueria La Chiapaneca,3,Best tacos in south austin.  Tortas. Pastor with pineapple.   Got go get some. William and Brodie lane
Taqueria La Chiapaneca,4,This place is one of the best spots in Austin to find  Mexican street food. I m from Mexico and this is my go to spot... there green salsa  pastor  amp  Bistek tacos are fire. It s a truck right next to the chevron gas station   Si quieren probar unos buenos tacos que te recuerden a Mexico este es el lugar. Este lugar es de los mejores de todo austin.. es un carrito que est n en el estacionamiento de la chevron.
Casa Jaliscienses,1,I know the golden rule of restaurants. Never visit when there is half an hour left to close  most times you will see servers already closing part of the restaurant down or you will feel rushed since everyone is trying to head home for the night.   After a long drive we were tired and hungry and just wanted a good meal before we headed to bed  fortunately for us we were there with more than an hour and a half till closing. We figured we hit that sweet spot of being able to take our time eating but still leave with about half an hour for them to close.   When we walked in there was a minute of confusion as to what to do  no sign told you to wait nor was there really anyone there to tell us where to sit. After a few awkward minutes we were sat and handed some menus  the girl seemed to not really want to be there   i quickly noticed it might be a family run restaurant since that is what seemed to be both serving and in the kitchen  The complementary salsa and tostadas were good  our orders were taken and the meal was brought out in time  but after that it was sort of a hassle to get drinks refilled or anything else brought to our table.   Kinda bummed about it since the food was pretty good  but the service was beyond something i would find acceptable for a restaurant. Hopefully next time will be better  they certainly have the food to be great  but their service is sadly under par.
Taqueria Monterrey,1,I have no idea where this truck is located these days  if anywhere at all.
El Mango Feliz,1,Extremely friendly atmosphere and amazing pricing for what you re getting. Much quality than other alternatives such as torchys
El Mango Feliz,2,Do not waste your time ordering from here. Thought it would ve been a good idea to doordash some tacos after a night of drinking. Horrible idea. The salsa is extremely pasty and thick. The meat almost felt like you were chewing on rubber. Awful experience. Overpriced tacos for them not to be good is ridiculous  Never again.
El Mango Feliz,3,Jesus Christ. 15 dollars for cheese and tortilla  DO NOT ORDER THE QUESADILLA. waste of money.
Taqueria Chelo,1,Got gas  I m not saying the food will give you gas  unless you get the beanos  but this taqueria is located inside the Chevron.  Their breakfast burritos are pre-made and left under the hot lamp. The usual suspects are in attendance  eggs  potatoes  american sausage  chorizo  etc.   The green and red salsas are tasty and the green is spicy   There are breakfast plates as well as a fairly lengthy lunch menu. I haven t anything except for the b-fast tacos  which are acceptable if you want something a few notches above a Whataburger taquito. I think the cooks would benefit from a bit more seasoning.  The price is right and there are a couple of tables inside the store if you want to sit and eat 
Taqueria Chelo,2,Saw a taco stand inside and thought  why not  go for it  and it was big mistake. Mistake  1 heat lamps. Mistake  2 potatoes were undercooked each and every time. I gave this place a try 3 times and each time it was a disappointment. The worst and biggest mistake of them all was telling them that the potatoes were undercooked and they got offended.  Ma am the potatoes were under cooked   they are not undercooked  we put them in a steamer. Now if you didn t like them. I will give you your money back  Woah  Really   this place is trifling.
Ley's Tacos,1,Hungry for something authentic late at night   Live on the Eastside  Brushing up on your Spanish   ...then Ley s Tacos is for you   Little taco trailer between 5th and 6th street on Comal with some decent food and a less than charming parking lot location.  The first time I went there  the kindly gentleman working that night asked if I wanted to try some menudo.  My gringo ass didn t know what that was so I said sure   My boyfriend and the owner giggled as I chewed the intestine soup pretending  probably badly  to enjoy it. Tripe is not my thing as it turns out.  BUT if you like tacos  this place is great late at night if you re in the area.  I had the chicken fajita tacos and they rocked.  Good quality meet  fresh avocado slices  and pico on a warm tortilla. They have that super-spicy  sort of creamy  green salsa found at many Eastside joints... mmmm.    Despite the fact that our Spanish was awful  and they didn t speak much English  they were super friendly and nice.  The tacos were  1 each so the price was right.   Woo tacos 
Taquria El Laurel,1,  UPDATE as of 09 09 2017. I came by as I wanted to give the Chichirrone taco another try. It was spot on today. The spice level was better  and they were cooked to perfection. With their green sauce  which is thick and spicy  it was delicious. The menu has expanded to more items. I will be back for sure.    UPDATE   I am continuing to leave this at 3 stars for now. I freely admit that I am a Menudo snob. Today was their first day having Menudo. It was  OK . While not my favorite Menudo  there were some bright spots for this new little truck that is building a local following.   The small Menudo had a lot of broth  but not a lot enough  meat  for my taste. No hominy  no bones and seemed a bit bland. Served with store bought tortillas  that is not always a bad thing if there is a lot of orders and they can t keep up with making them or want the place easily cleaned . If someone wanted to try Menudo for the first time  this is a good introduction. Now the bright spots  after I ordered  I  did notice the pot on the grill.  While waiting  I glanced into the trash can and saw no cans of Menudo or the dreaded  Bag O  Menudo as I actually seen at some other places. It was served in a nice clean bowl and the lady running the trailer actually asked  Is that enough   That is the first time I have been asked that and as she is still trying to determine quantities to have no left-overs  I was quite pleased. The meat had obviously been cut by hand  beware of that has all the same size  and that made me wag my tail.  I will try again in a few weeks to check it out then.   Yelp had not put the correct address or zip code  so I sent it in again. It is on Brodie Lane  not Slaughter. I sent in a correction.  So far A-OK. Today I had a Chichirrone taco and the Chichirrone had ben cooked in tomato sauce. I was a little early and I think they needed about 20 minutes more cooking. But not bad. There is a bit of communication issue  so be very clear about what you are ordering. I will continue to try things at this new little truck and see if stars need adjustment. Menudo is the target for this Saturday. They do have a table under an awning to help with the sun.
Victorina's Food,1,I love this place  Cynthia  the owner  is so sweet and offers call in orders. They make everything fresh and it is 100  authentic. Their green sauce... to die for. AND the prices are great  Can t get this kind of food for this price anywhere else 
Victorina's Food,2,It s not closed   I got a great lunch there today. It s in the parking lot of the Gulf station on the northeast corner of I-35 and 38-1 2 St. - I stopped to get gas  and the aroma was so good that I decided it was the right place to get my lunch before heading in to work...  The fish taco was very good  and the veggie taco was outstanding   Veggie had potato  avocado  cactus  nopal   cotijo cheese  a lovely combo. And as a bonus  I got a little heap of pickled vegetables - onion  carrots  jalapeno slices - and a charred roasted whole pepper   Very tasty lunch for less than  6.
Mariscos Mazatlan Taqueria Mi Tierra,1,This place is located within the somewhat newly opened Westgate Marketplace  which is a collection of shops within what used to be an Albertson s grocery store.    In general  I m pretty hesistant to eat at any shopping center food facility because A  it s usually not that good and B  always seems overpriced.  But  after walking around for awhile  I soon realized I needed to eat something  so why not put my best Yelp face forward and take one for the team   Well  the Mariscos Mazatlan  Taqueria Mi Tierra  I didn t know quite what to call it because both names are on the front of this booth  is pretty much the only restaurant in the place and is more of a typical Mexican taqueria than Tex-Mex restaurant.  That means if you re expecting psuedo Mexican food like Nachos and 3 lb vegetarian burritos  you re out of luck.    Some of the many items they serve include ceviche  sopes  quesadillas and menudo.  However  I tried the tacos al pastor  a mole torta  and jamaica aguas fresca on my visit.    The al pastor tacos were complimented by diced mango and grilled onions with your choice of tortilla.  Both types do not appear to be handmade  though.  Overall  the tacos were decent in taste  but a little less flavorful than you would think they might be.    The torta was pretty huge--about the same size as a small loaf of bread--and filled with chicken mole  lettuce  refried beans  and Oaxacan cheese.  Again  decent flavor but not outstanding.  The mole also lacked a strong  defining flavor.  One big problem both dishes had was bit too much grease and the flavors suffered because of it.  Still  both were quite edible  though  just not the best I ve ever had.  The aguas fresca was good.   Jamaica  seems like one of those flavors that s kind of hard to find  so props for including that along with the other 3 or 4 varieties.    So how about the prices  you ask   A couple of tacos  at  4 for two   a torta   4   and the aguas fresca  around  3   ended up costing around  12 with tax.  It s not exhorbitant  but there are  quite possibly  20 other taquerias within a 5 mile radius with prices cheaper than that.  For lunch anywhere  though  that s pretty reasonable  To sum up  if you re in the neighborhood  or maybe at the shopping center  this isn t necessarily a bad lunch option.  Just be prepared  though  because it s not the best Mexican food you ll ever have.
Pinches Tacos,1,This is the one taco truck where the vibe is always on point    Have you ever had the best taco ever crafted  This is where you get  em from   Absolutely gorgeous cuts of tender meat  salsa that s from the Good Lords secret stash  and Service that puts Pinches Tacos above anything else I ve ever had. 10 10 nothing I eat now will ever be as enjoyable after being exposed to such bomb tacos make sure you order an extra taco and eat it for me 
Pinches Tacos,2,So happy to have this option for tacos while at Revival Coffee. Everything I have had is amazing and the service can t be beat either 
Pinches Tacos,3,Is good tacos and good costumer service asada good and pastor is veered the mafia tacos
Tacos Lucy,1,Meh. There are better options around  Taco More  or the Rositas Al Pastor truck.
Loading Zone Grill,1,Saturday evening Blanca and her truck were parked behind The Cigar Vault in Buda. Wow awesome Chicken Street Tacos  Probably the best I ve had to date. Give the Loading Zone Grill a try  I promise you stomach and taste buds will thank you   
Loading Zone Grill,2,We love tacos and were surprised there weren t any places in this area .... And then came the little yellow taco truck    YES   Breakfast and lunch are both delicious here   Do yourself a favor and stop by    The lady that works there is super friendly   My son loves to go there too     Cold Topo Chico and delicious tacos   What more could you ask for   
Loading Zone Grill,3,Great food reasonably priced. Very nice lady runs the food trailer. Goes somewhere else on weekends but during the week she is located at corner of 1626 and Bliss Spillar.
Taqueria Las NiÃ±as,1,Every taco I ve had off their menu was fantastic  highly recommend the pastor and nopales in particular 
Taqueria la Guera #2,1,Some of the best gorditas I have found in Austin. And believe me  I have sampled them from 2-3 dozen restaurants. These guys gorditas are actual pockets  as God and Mexicans intended. I prefer mine without the beans tho. Just steak fajita  lettuce  tomato  cilantro  pico de gallo  shredded white cheese and green sauce.
Taqueria Las Chismosas,1,This late night taco joint is delicious  We stumbled in after a night on 6th  and were blown away. The men working were friendly for it being 2am and made our food quick and delicious. The decor is minimal and there s only a few tables since this is meant to be a to go place. We had the Al pastor burrito and steak tacos. Also get the horchata and the tomatillo salsa  Must try
Tacos Vallecito,1,The handmade tortillas make this place a special one. The tripas are some of the beat around and the aguas frescas are the best companion to the food they serve.
IBM Cafeteria,1,IBM Austin had decent cafeteria food in the early  00s  but it seems like their contractor had them over a barrel or something because prices went up and quality went down. Back in the day  you could get a couple of pretty good breakfast tacos for three or four bucks during breakfast  and lunch was good enough that most folks might only eat out once a week.  By 2010-ish  my friends who were still at IBM would never eat in the cafeteria because it was known to be kinda expensive despite having lower quality food than even the worst fast food you could find in the area.  Luckily  the decline of the IBM cafeteria coincided with the rise of more lunch options in the area  so there are lot of options around if you want to avoid this place.
Lada Ladies,1,This is one of my favorite food trucks   These ladies really get it right.   They come to our neighborhood often and there are always people lined up and ready   It s totally worth it. It was also nice to be outside the truck and chatting with neighbors.   I ve eaten everything they have but my fav is the chicken enchiladas.  My son absolutely loves the Lada wrap. The cream sauce they use is thick and flavorful.  The chicken is fresh  shredded white meat.  It s delicious   Rice and beans are cooked well and tasted great.   Ohhhh and the queso   OMG. The queso is creamy and you won t be able to stop eating it.   These ladies are also friendly and fun.  They even put up with my husbands silly jokes.    Sadly  we ate before I got pics - sorry   But go see Lada Ladies.  You ll be glad you did  
Lada Ladies,2,We had a function at work where these lovely ladies rolled up and provided lunch for us  and they can come back anytime and twice on Sunday. They provided great service and food. I am not a sweets person  so I am picky about lemonade  and I cannot stress enough how good the hibiscus lemonade is. OMG  I went back and got a second cup  it was that good. And let s just say that was the best queso I have ever had. I enjoyed that it was white rather than yellow cheese. The beans  rice and enchiladas had wonderful flavor. If you see this food truck roll up you need to belly up to the window and place an order. Even if it s just chips  queso and lemonade for something light or a full meal you will not be disappointed
Lada Ladies,3,Very good food.  I had the Lada Enchilada Plate with beef and my wife had the Lada Chicken Bowl and we also got a side of their Chips and Questions.  Everything was very good and my Enchilada was the size of a Burrito.  Very filling and satisfying.
Lada Ladies,4,This food truck comes to where I work on a fairly regular basis. They offer very delicious food at a very fair price and the service is so very welcoming and friendly.   The enchiladas are delicious. So are the bowls. I love the Quesidillas as they are big tasty and filling. Get the delicious salsa to go with it. When the the weather is cold they offer enchilada soup. Think tortilla soup with enchilada spice. I love it with chicken.   A great food truck for a satisfying meal. You won t regret it.
Lada Ladies,5,They came to our neighborhood and I have to say - I wasn t expecting to be blown away by enchiladas from a food truck. However  I was wrong. We got the sucia and enchilada plates  both with beef . Due to the COVID situation  we got them to go  so the aroma from the plates filled my car and I knew then they d be delicious  The enchilada wrap was too big for me to eat in one session. Hope to see them soon again 
Lada Ladies,6,Lada ladies came by my neighborhood one evening and they did not disappoint  They were about to close down but we texted in our order and they made it happen. They were delicious. Queso  quac  and all the fixings were incredible  They also included two free limonadas because they knew we worked at H-E-B  Thank you so much LADA LADIES. Love your new  1 fans. These ladies know how to cook    you won t be disappointed.
Lada Ladies,7,Updated. Because they are still wonderful   I was excited to hear they were coming back  So you know  We had to stop by. I was Greeted with a smile and amazing attitude  which is thee best   Yummy food all around   We tried the beef lada sucia and it was great  The chips and queso    Delish     Yum  yummy  yum   Pictures added of the chicken and cheese enchilada plate as well     Thanks ladies. For being Fun  and amazing to chat with  Thanks for making some delicious food for us to eat. We love it 
Lada Ladies,8,My experience went as follows   1  Placed order online  your order will be ready  12 15  2  I get there at 12 10  I proceed to get in line  based on the context at hand   3  My name is never called  I m finally at the front of line.  4  I tell them I placed an order for 12 15  they proceed to start making my order.  If you re cool with that process management  good for you.
Lada Ladies,9,Their food is still great. I moved so unfortunately I can t get them as much  but do when I can. The owners are very friendly personable and accommodating to my pickiness. And I ll readily admit I m picky. I highly recommend anyone to check them out.
Lada Ladies,10,Love love love Lada Ladies   I met them two years ago at Sights and Sounds  and they quickly became my go-to for dinner each night of the festival.  Food is cooked fresh  tastes amazing  and the family behind the business is so sweet 
Lada Ladies,11,Caught these ladies at the Eilan for lunch. I ordered the chicken Lada Quesadilla. It was delicious  and nicely stuffed. Word of caution  the tomatillo sauce is inside  I figured they forgot to add it since there was nothing on top. The woman I spoke with was super helpful and cheerfully explained that the sauce was not missing and was inside. She even offered me an extra side of sauce.   I don t know if she is one of the owners of the truck  but it took my review to a 5  Other businesses take note  be pleasant  it makes all the difference in the world  Can t wait for them to come back so I can try the wraps and some of this Red Lada sauce I have heard so much about.
Lada Ladies,12,OMG  I had the beef Lada bowl  cream cheesecake roll  amp  Hibiscus lemonade and it was amazing     Can t wait to try the rest of the menu  the side salad  with corn was so delightfulfood made with love   Thank you for serving us on Friday   Sheila
Lada Ladies,13,Queso is fantastic. Fresh ingredients used for wrap. Anxious for another opportunity to try something different. Of course will order Queso again.
Lada Ladies,14,Got the Lada wrap and cheese enchiladas with rice  amp  beans. The tortilla chips in the wrap add a nice crunch. Plenty of cheese and sauce on the enchiladas  flavorful with a bit of spice. The limited mixed berry lemonade is the perfect amount of sweet  with real berries  not syrup.
Lada Ladies,15,Best food ever  Wraps and queso is on point. If u ever get the chance  definitely try them. Customer service is always friendly and welcoming.
Lada Ladies,16,Best damn wraps this side of the universe. Chicken is delicious but the beef is where it s at. Me and the boys at work always eat out at Lada Ladies when they come rolling through the oaks.
Lada Ladies,17,I got the Chicken Lada Wrap  and overall it was just good. I will say that the ingredients tasted very fresh  and the wrap wasn t greasy at all  which isn t expected from a food truck. Other than that  the wrap itself was nothing too special  it was just good  not bad  not really good. The plates and enchiladas might be better  which I think are what they are more known for.
Lada Ladies,18,Chicken enchiladas were awesome    The staff was friendly and the kids enjoyed the quesadillas.
Lada Ladies,19,The veggie enchilada is DELICIOUS    You can truly taste the freshness of their ingredients     I was very surprised how good their lemonade is  perfect sweetness   
Lada Ladies,20,I had their chicken enchiladas last night   the Dia De Los Muertos fireworks festival   Woodlawn lake  and they WERE SOOOOOO FREAKING GOOD  I D RATE THEM 10 STARS IF I COULD  
Lada Ladies,21,This was the best part of Sights and Sounds for me... I m even thinking of going again just to get another wrap lol   I browsed all the other food vendors and saw Lada Ladies wrap picture and it was love at first sight.  The staff was super friendly and accommodating.  I first ordered 1 regular beef enchilada wrap  went and shared with my family  and after asking my wife what she wanted to eat   no I m good  answer  guess who ate most of it    So of course I had to go get another one so I could could enjoy most of that deliciousness   I d love to try other things they offer  but I ll have to wait until I stumble into San Antonio.  Keep up the work 
Lada Ladies,22,Lada Ladies was a huge hit at our wedding   They killed it  The FOOD  amp  service was amazing  Every single one of our guests loved the food  Definitely recommend Lada Ladies  Delicious 
La Poblanita,1,If you want authentic Mexican food  visit xochi  Kind soul and great food and drinks.  She is in a small food truck near a gyro and pizza place. Infront of body shop  Nice new business and great food. Hope to come again
