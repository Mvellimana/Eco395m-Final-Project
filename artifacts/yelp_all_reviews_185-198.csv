La Flor,1,Best bacon  egg and cheese I ve had in my 10 years living in Austin. Friendly and fast service too 
La Flor,2,Ate too many beans here but  2 a taco is what s up.  Literally cannot understand any part of this awful city and its pricing.  Boycott absurd taco joints.  I think it s 6 bucks for a lengua at Papalote  Lmao.  La Flor slaps.  Watched a guy who  I think  owns the corner store drive up  blaring electronica  get out in his loud af gear  walk up like Pitbull to a homeless camp next door and rouse one of the fellows to come get a Rockstar.  Badass.
La Flor,3,Damn. Good. Tacos.   Too delicious  couldn t pull the taco away from my mouth long enough to take a photo.  Get in my belly   Best tacos I have found in Austin.  They were out of everything but the carnitas and pastor but was still incredibly yummy.  Much better and cheaper than Torchy s.  Will be back again and again.
La Flor,4,Delicious and priced right. The tortillas are just the best. And even the simple cheese quesadilla is perfection. I love having this spot in the neighborhood.
La Flor,5,Very good food. The flour tortilla is not home made which makes them sweaty and soggy from heat of food which is normal but good flavor. Breakfast tacos are well made lots of flavor.
La Flor,6,Hark  It was glorious. Did you eat what I ate  Come all ye faithful taco eaters - joyful and triumphant.  Wow. This really put meaning into those Christmas Carols that I ve been listening to. Glorious. Joyful. Triumphant. These tacos put meaning behind those words.  I have several lists of food in the Austin area and La Flor is on four of those. Wow  some other folks must love it. Now  I do too.  It is a very unassuming manger  I mean food truck  in an obscure part of the city. But the food is truly magical  sublime  festive. I had the carnitas taco and the polo chicken. I wish I had taken pictures. They truly are the best I ve had in Austin. There s a reason that these make so many food lists. They are flavorful. They come on fresh  hand made tortillas  unique flavor  and dirt cheap. These are what put taco trucks onto the map and it stays that way.  Joy to the world  The tacos have come.
La Flor,7,the best fajita tacos and the best handmade tortillas. I recommend you stop by and try you will not regret
La Flor,8,Cheap   2 a taco  and delicious. The tortillas are thick and pretty large. I like to go for the breakfast tacos because they are pretty customizable but their steak  carnitas and chicken are all great too. Get bacon in your breakfast tacos - it comes thick crunchy bits  you won t be disappointed.  They also serve quesadillas and gorditas if you want something other than tacos.
La Flor,9,I ve been coming here since I was a little lad with my old man right before we went to work and I can say these are some damn good breakfast tacos.Not only do they make their own homemade tortillas but also have great tasting food.Its not all just tacos you can grab yourself a gordita with whatever filling you want but you can also pair it with a nice atole.Mi paisas si quieren un buen Lonche la Flor es el lugar.
La Flor,10,Best breakfast tacos in Austin  which means they just might be the best breakfast tacos in all of existence. The tacos are two dollars each  and they let you mix ingredients and get whatever you want on a flour or corn tortilla. The corn tortillas are incredible and the flour tortillas are good as well. Everything is perfectly cooked and the red and green salsa are both flavorful and just the right amount of spicy. I can t recommend the corn tortillas enough  they compare favorably to many of the higher end Mexican restaurants in Austin.
La Flor,11,Christian and his mom make the best breakfast tacos in Austin. There s not even a close 2nd. Their homemade corn tortillas are the perfect thickness and are never dry.  The service is always great.
La Flor,12,Best breakfast tacos in Austin  hands down. The tortillas are amazing- thick  chewy  and hot. The food is authentic  and the service is great. I truly feel like I found a hidden gem with La Flor 
La Flor,13,These are the tacos my grandma used to make me on Sunday mornings.   Homemade carnitas  hand-cut papas and those hand-rolled flour tortillas  If for nothing else  go for the tortillas. Unlike anything you can find in Austin.  Check out the menu I posted for the different types of tacos. They re out of some of the meats later in the day  so keep an open mind. They re also super accommodating  like making me a quesadilla and huevos a la mexicana when they re not even on the menu.   Best part   2 tacos  no matter what you order.
La Flor,14,Their food here is authentic Mexican  U won t regret trying this place  My favorite is the quesadilla and all their tortillas are homemade   
La Flor,15,Another reviewer said this was a great place even for vegetarian tacos. No  it is not  BE AWARE  they cook EVERYTHING IN LARD  Nothing on the menu can be made vegetarian because it is all made with lard. No bueno.   As a vegetarian  I am used to having to avoid certain menu items like beans or rice which are more often than not made with lard  bacon  chicken stock  or other animal products. This is usually no big deal because I can order an egg  potato  nopale taco or whatever other veggie options a place offers. But you can t do that at La Flor since everything is cooked in lard and they don t offer a vegetarian-friendly alternative. Bummer. But there are plenty of other yummy taco places in Austin to choose from.
La Flor,16,The corn tortillas were tasty but a little thick for me. They don t scramble the eggs fluffy and the sausage was dry and too salty. But my bean egg and cheese taco was pretty good. The tortillas are so large they should fill em a little bit more. But all in all a decent taco if you re passing by and hungry.
La Flor,17,I ve been coming here ever since i was a kid  im 26 now. I basically grew up on this taco truck. Its amazing food. Home made corn tortillas. The food is fresh. You can call in orders. You can sit at the picnic tables on beautiful days. You definitely have to gove it a shot when your in the neighborhood 
La Flor,18,My god     this place makes the best fijita tacos or what     We eat here almost every day. My favorite is the fajita taco. Make sure you ask for the grilled peppers  They can be extremely hot . If you are looking some great tacos in town this place is the best     BTW  this place is called  La Flor  not La flour   
La Flor,19,Delicious breakfast tacos for a good price. The flour tortillas were handmade  soft  and slightly chewy. We got one taco with bacon  sausage and eggs  savory  and the other with potato  eggs  sausage and beans  filling . If you want a hearty meal  get two tacos   Don t forget the sauce 
La Flor,20,La Flor is in the top tier of the Austin taco totem pole. If you re nearby when they re open  breakfast and lunch only   you better get your taco on.  Handmade corn and flour tortillas  I usually stalk my tacos on corn tortillas  but here  I get both because they actually do wheat flour justice . The tortillas are huge  so the tacos are a great value as well.
La Flor,21,Great tacos from a little convenience store trailer.   2 each for any taco on the menu  breakfast or lunch.  The green salsa is spicier than the red salsa but not too spicy.  Definitely going back tomorrow.
La Flor,22,Loved it   Blogged about it   Definitely adding this to my list of go-to taco spots    a href   redir url https 3A 2F 2Ftacososcuros.wordpress.com 2F2017 2F07 2F19 2Fcompletely-flord 2F amp s 1b88e3045bf1d407d885a79872cefa6daa0d20b47bdfa9bfeb013992fd8acc8d  rel  nofollow  target  _blank  tacososcuros.wordpress.c   a 
La Flor,23,Five barks for real  You gotta order the Egg  Nopal  and cheese. I can t do bacon anymore because I don t eat mammals - peace to my girl Okja.  Can t go wrong but they use some strong cleaner on the counter you can smell 20 feet away. Worth the fumes... Petey out.
La Flor,24,I used to stop by here somewhat rarely on the off-chance that I was early to work. Since then  I ve started working from home. Among other things  this means I can go days without wearing pants  assuming I don t want to go out and get things like food.  Some days  La Flor is the only reason I wear pants.
La Flor,25,I ll take the pepsi challenge with any taco truck against La Flor tacos. You can taste the love in every taco.
La Flor,26,Carnitas Taco good  but a bit dry. Corn tortillas excellent with Guisada  meat very tender. Piccadilla with potatoes on flour tortillas was my favorite  For  2 a taco you can t go wrong here. Salsa is bit on the mild side for me  but tasty. Limited seating  but big lot  more seating would be great  food truck could also use some sprucing up  public bus stop next to truck  but other than that well worth the stop 
La Flor,27,So I had my reservations eating at this place...located outside of a corner store that s sole purpose is to sell cigarettes  lotto tickets and booze  and having a handwritten menu in a stand that looks hand built  it just looked seedy to me.  However this place has probably the best breakfast taco in Austin  certainly the best that I ve had  2  is a great deal  these tacos will fill you until dinner. Tortillas taste handmade  perfectly scrambled eggs with a little pico  skillet potatoes  salty mexican bacon and ooey gooey cheese...mmm. I live within walking distance  I can see myself coming here on a weekly basis. Don t waste your money at some taco cabana or some poorly made donut shop tacos.
La Flor,28,It s easy to miss La Flor  as it s a food truck tucked away in the corner of a parking lot next to a Hula Hu convenience store on South First. But if you want to have the best breakfast taco in Austin  make sure you don t miss it. I ve lived in Austin since 1986  and I ve eaten a lot  really -- a LOT  of breakfast tacos. They re ubiquitous around here. And La Flor has the best breakfast tacos. Bar none. Really  there isn t even any competition. They make them on a grill  which you can see while you re ordering. I almost always get the bacon  egg  and cheese. They brown a good size  really delicious tortilla  fry what looks like a whole egg  put it in there with some chunky bits of bacon and the tastiest cheese you could want  and serve it to you REALLY hot. I top it off with some of their  somewhat spicy  green sauce and -- well -- it s breakfast heaven. They have a  somewhat spicy  red sauce you can put on there as well  if you prefer  and if you re really lucky  they ll serve you a taco with a double tortilla. In fact  that seems to happen whenever I order two or more tacos -- one s got a double tortilla  and because of that magic grill  it tastes doubly delicious. And they don t just serve tacos -- they ll make you burritos  Gorditas  whatever you want. And the best part   2 each. You can t get this kind of value  for the quality or the price  anywhere else in Austin. They re open Monday through Saturday  no Sundays  until 2 00 pm  serving breakfast and lunch. If you haven t been  go. You will NOT be disappointed.
La Flor,29,My favorite and I know a lot of the taco stands in town   The staff are super - they seem genuinely happy and the tacos are great  cheap  and delicious.... the hot sauce  which is a big part of my judging mechanism is excellent    the tacos are homemade  and they spice them with just the right amount of extra love and cilantro 
La Flor,30,If you find yourself driving south on congress it before you get to staaney there is La flour. This is one of those taco shacks. It is permantly located in a small trailer next to the Stop and Shop. Dont let the apperance fool you they have some great food.  The breakfast tacos are warm and filling and at  1.50 you cant beat it. I say the bacon egg and cheese is my favorite.  As for Lunch you can get many different items from tacos to tortas all ranging from  1.50 -  3.00. My favorite is the Carnitas Torta. It has tender pork on a bolio roll with letttuce  tomatoes  jalepenoes  refreind beans  onionds and sour cream.  If you get there after 2pm they will be out of the carnitas so stop by early. If you find yourself driving south on congress it
La Flor,31,Fairly solid cheap taco trailer. Their basic breakfast taco  which for my purposes is bacon egg cheese  is good and cheap  as it should be  and comes on a decent tortilla. Good salsa  though it s not quite spicy enough for me.  Their tortas are also worth investigating. They somewhat atypically come with refried beans in addition to your normal fillings  lettuce  sour cream  jalape os . Carnitas is a good bet if you re torn between meats. A breakfast taco and a torta is a grand total of  6.  They re in the Stop and Shop parking lot about midway between Stassney and St Elmo on S 1st  which is a somewhat odd location but at least is fairly convenient for me. They re open for breakfast and lunch only  but they serve breakfast stuff at lunch too  the way that God intended.
La Flor,32,If you re looking for fast  affordable  and delicious  this is the place. There are a couple picnic tables  but you re probably better off getting it to go  tables are in the Texas sun . Tacos are cheap at only  2 a piece  cash only I think . Two should be good for most people  three if you re famished or just eat a lot. The handmade tortillas have a reputation for a reason. Both flour and corn were delicious and while I normally favor flour  I enjoyed their corn more. The Desebrada was my favorite of what I tried  and I will certainly be back here to explore more of the menu 
La Flor,33,DELICIOUS  cheap tacos that do not disappoint. I find myself craving comparing La Flor s tacos when I m at a sit-down Mexican restaurant and I think that says a lot. Cash only.
La Flor,34,Simply put  amazing breakfast tacos.  And cheap too   2 each  whatever you put on them.  The nopales and eggs are especially good. Usually pretty busy on the weekend  but worth the wait.  You can save a little time if you phone in your order.
La Flor,35,I stopped here for a quick bite to eat while traveling. I looked them up after they were featured in the southern living magazine in the fall. They are a hole in the wall place  but after you eat there you won t forget it. Homemade corn tortillas are delicious. I purchased nopal with cheese and fajita tacos for my family. After leaving I regretted not buying more my boys are picky and the wanted more. Thank you for providing great service  at great prices and awesome service. I will be back.
La Flor,36,It s amazing. The tacos are super cheap and taste awesome  the best flour tortillas.
La Flor,37,I ve lived in this neighborhood for 7 years. We are loyal customers to La Flor. I have their number on my phone.  ring ring   Bueno    Hey it s Graham from down the street   OH HEY   - How many tacos today  ... and after that it s just a matter of establishing how many Al Pastor or egg  bacon  amp  cheese are necessary. Best Al Pastor in town. Hands down 
La Flor,38,Best breakfast tacos in town  I live way north but try to make it down at least once a month. Have driven from 4 points just for the homemade corn tortillas also 
La Flor,39,I live right around the corner  but I would definitely make a special trip if I didn t. Bistec Taco. With capital letters. What do they do to them that makes them so good  Little strips of marinated beef cooked on a flat top until some bits are crispy while others are tender  topped with chopped onion and cilantro on a well grilled tortilla. This simple-sounding taco is a complex flavor explosion that I am unable to explain. Good god  they re even good cold.
La Flor,40,Highly underrated  Delicious  fresh  filling tacos are the bomb  Seriously  their tortillas are to die for. Everything is made fresh  but it never takes them long to create the deliciousness. There can be a language barrier  at times  but it gives me a chance to practice my Spanish  Love this place 
La Flor,41,Quick and friendly service  and the food is good but not great. A solid choice for when San Juanita s at Congress and Stassney is on vacation.
La Flor,42,I second the carnitas torta  Yummy  I love taco trailers...
La Flor,43,I agree with Lazy S that these are about the best tacos you can get  even for the vegan vegetarian. I m convinced it s the best salsa in town  both red and green  the red is my personal favorite though  and the home made from the ground up taste is just great. And absolutely a great way to go on the cheap. I always get potato bean and tomato. Everyone I have taken there whether veg or not has given it great praise and I m glad to live so close to my favorite south Austin food.  0
Taqueria Gardenia,1,Amazing taco. Super authentic and the flavorful. I was only able to get the chicken taco  pollo asada  but it tasted so good and so fresh and the salsa that came with it was perfectly spiced. I will be back to try their other tacos. Only issue I have is when I go back sometimes they re closed and it s not clear what the hours are.  Also it is cash only FYI 
Taqueria Gardenia,2,I came across this food truck on my way back to north Texas and glad I stopped to eat. The tacos Al pastor with hand made tortillas were soooo delicious. The meat had the right flavor and the hand made tortillas were fluffy with that Mexican flavor. I highly recommend this food truck   
Taqueria Gardenia,3,The father son duo is absolutely killer at this truck. Went 3 days in row and will keep coming  After my 27 years of living here  I can gladly say this is as close to a Valley taco as you can get
Taqueria Gardenia,4,Best tacos in the North Central Austin area. Homemade tortillas are a big plus  they always have fresh meat and service is fast. This is a hidden gem and more people should know about it.
Taqueria Gardenia,5,Such a random spot  but I work right next door and all my coworkers go to this place so I had to try it. Glad I did  Amazing tacos for a crazy cheap price  I eat a full meal for  5. The carnitas and pastor tacos are the best I ve had   
Taqueria Gardenia,6,This place is still open and OH BOY IS IT GOOD.  My friends and I have come to the consensus that this is the best late night taco fix  or any time really .  The prices are great and I love that grilled onions and peppers come free with your meal.  I highly recommend the carne asada quesadilla.  F-ing delicious.  My new and top spot for tacos and quesadillas 
Taqueria Gardenia,7,I LOVE this place  it s one of my favorites on N. Lamar. They have such a wide range of menu items instead of just tacos. I ve had everything from the tacos  to breakfast tacos  elotes  nachos and soup. It s my go-to lunch spot. The owner is extremely friendly and treats his customers like family. They have a drive-thru on one side and a covered area to with tables to sit and eat on the other. Plus the prices are great  Oh and the salsas - they are delicious  They have a super spicy dark one that s amazing but be careful if you don t like spice.
Taqueria Gardenia,8,This is one of the top tier taco trucks in town. I ve only been here once  but I already know.   Friendly folks. Supple corn tortillas  made by hand. Distinctive beef fajita. But the carnitas  with its crispy browned bits  won over. Three salsas  including a molcajete. Pickled onions  carrots and sporty peppers. Cilantro y cebolla all the way.  I need more of these tacos in my life.
Taqueria Gardenia,9,Wow came because of the yelp reviews and can say this place lives up to the hype. I had the Pastor and Carnitas Tacos and they were amazing    I can t wait to come here again. Best of All the tortillas were so fresh and there were also delicious grilled onions that you can use for topping 
Taqueria Gardenia,10,I loved my carne asada burrito and the spicy jalape o salsa  I will definitely be back  For  5 per burrito  how could I resist 
Taqueria Gardenia,11,Taqueria Gardenia a popular food trailer located in North Central Austin at the T intersection of St. John s Avenue and Roland Johnson--practically off I-35.  They are really popular.  I always see people eating here.  Once I drove by at 6 am in the dark pre-dawn morning and there were four people sitting at the table under the blue awning.    During the lunch hour  there s a lot of customer traffic  too.  Many people get large takeout orders.  I see people eating at the table during lunch  too.  There are big containers of salsa and pico de gallo on the table  among other condiments.  I ate there once but it was windy and keeping the napkin from blowing away was a pain.  The menu is listed on a nicely-printed poster next to the order window.  The prices aren t listed but from what I ve experienced  tacos are  1.50  tax included  each.  That s cheaper than most taco trucks in Austin.  Breakfast tacos or time are only  1 each.  They don t have m any  vegan choices.  Bean tacos maybe   The menu accommodates the 80  of Austin who eat meat.  The food is delicious.  I like the red salsa more than the yellowish greenish one because it s a lot spicier.    Taqueria Gardenia is next to the Valero in a little strip mall.  It s pretty easy to find parking.  One of the Hispanic proprietors actually knows some Chinese.  I was ordering in Spanish and he responded in correct Chinese  as a joke or whatever   but it was impressive nevertheless.
Taqueria Gardenia,12,Es Bueno taco stand. Barbacoa is legit. Salsa is muy Bueno. Tortillas in house.nice and non desripct.
Taqueria Gardenia,13,ALWAYS the move after a night out drinking. These are personally some of the best tacos I have ever had. Their tortillas are exceptionally good  and their salsa verde too. This place is also super inexpensive and open extremely late. Bless this place lol 
Taqueria Gardenia,14,I laugh whenever anyone mentions Torchy s or a similar place  don t get me wrong  they re pretty good  but this place is the real deal.  I don t know why some people have said it s expensive  every taco I ve got has been  2 each  although I think some are  2.50  which can t be beat for what you get.   Severed with onions and cilantro.  Both red and green sauces are amazing and pack some heat.  Oh  and homemade tortillas that are perfect.  If you re into some of the more authentic exotic Mexican tacos  i.e. tripas  barbacoa  chicharron  then this is your place.  I usually get an al pastor and bistec which is also amazing.  Best part is that they re usually open late  which is awesome because it s right near my house and makes it perfect for those late night alcohol munchies.    Oh  and I think out of all the years I ve been to this place I ve seen a fellow white person maybe once  so you know it s good 
Taqueria Gardenia,15,Very friendly staff and solid tacos. Open really late  and within walking distance from a lot of neighborhoods.
Taqueria Gardenia,16,The homemade corn tortillas got me    Plus the chicharron. These tacos were sooooo good  but for 4 tacos off a taco truck   10  I mean it s not a problem  I paid it. But I think she got over on me cause I didn t speak Spanish. Whatever.
Taqueria Gardenia,17,My favorite local taco truck. The gorditas are amazing  my favorite thing on the menu and pretty cheap. The people who own the truck are super friendly and have had us coming back for over 5 years now 
Taqueria Gardenia,18,Wow   This little taco trailer  it s not a truck  is super nondescript and we probably would have missed it if not for the yelp entry.  No menu or anything but the tacos   all the usual suspects though  al pastor  asada  Pollo a la plancha etc .  Wonderful street tacos.  Go get em.
Taqueria Gardenia,19,The most amazing Mexican food I ve ever had  We got the al pastor burrito  chicken taco  and carnitas taco and they were all amazing--and even better  everything together was only  9. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone living in traveling through Austin.
Taqueria Gardenia,20,Best Mexican tacos I ve had in Austin  Period. I m from Brownsville  Texas. I ve grown up on Mexican food all of my life. I ve been to many Mexican restaurants and food trucks here in Austin and none can compare to real Mexican food. With that said  this food truck comes pretty damn close. The tacos are only  2 each and are stuffed with meat and veggies. I love that I can choose between corn and flour tortillas. Soda glass bottles are also only  2 each. I can t give this place 5 stars because it is still not the same as actual Mexican food  but like I said  it comes pretty damn close.  For everyone saying the location is sketchy and thought you d get mugged  y all are racists. I ve gone there many times and have taken many friends there of different cultures  and we ve had nothing but great times. The people are very nice. I love this place and will continue to go there as often as I can.
Taqueria Gardenia,21,I got super sick after eating here. No prices are listed  menu is slapped together and I felt like I might get mugged.  One star  cause I have to  and because the tacos tasted good going down.  blort 
Taqueria Gardenia,22,Great taco truck  Ordered a chorizo and egg  Fast service  too. If in North Austin you MUST STOP HERE FOR BREAKFAST  Service was very cordial.
Taqueria Gardenia,23,The tacos are pretty damn good. Hand made corn tortillas made to order filled with very flavorful animal protein   topped off with cilantro and onions   and some very delicious green and red salsa. The tacos are  2 to  2.50 per taco. It may seem pricey but it s worth it. This has become my to go lunch dive when I work in this area of Austin.
Taqueria Gardenia,24,No menu  no prices  but not really necessary- They have the basic menu  tacos  burritos  quesadillas  with the typical meats  asada  pollo  al pastor  carnitas .  My burrito was 5 -
Taqueria Gardenia,25,If you crave legit tacos then look no farther then this place. They are incredible. And nothing beats a handmade tortilla  They re always fresh and cooked right on the spot.  2 for a regular taco and  1.50 for breakfast tacos  Try it out. You won t be disappointed 
Taqueria Gardenia,26,Probably some of the best tacos I ve had in Austin  Super delicious and very inexpensive  I ll be back.
Taqueria Gardenia,27,This place is delicious. Pretty standard taco  amp  burrito menu but they re really doing it right. I love the steak burrito. 5 bucks for a burrito the size of Chipotle made by a sweet Mexican grandma. The guy who is always there is awesome. He s always smiling and is a great chef as well. I prefer this place to any Mexican food in Austin. Since I visited Mexico  I ve always been disappointed with Mexican food in the states  but these guys bring me right back.
Taqueria Gardenia,28,Amazing tacos. Friendly service. Muy sabroso    I come here for lunch during work  and it s such a treat. They have great salsas  cooked to order  the meats are seasoned and cooked just right. Highly recommend barbacoa and al pastor. Great prices too 
Taqueria Gardenia,29,Great little taco truck  Only a couple bucks for a sizable taco. The carnitas was very good  but the al pastor was the best. Definitely worth a try 
Taqueria Gardenia,30,Gardenia of Eden.  2 tacos nestled in thick soft handmade corn tortillas-- out of this world. So thick they seem closer to crepes or pancakes than tortillas  they are a sumptuous delight I ve never experienced. I lived in LA before Texas and I thought I d tasted good home made tortillas  but these are simply a new culinary experience. Tables and chairs outside could not be more simple  and it s group seating. Not a place for a date or close chat with a friend  but if you ve got a group of people or it s late night and you re hungry this is a food truck dream.
Taqueria Gardenia,31,Still good tacos  though the steak was chewy this time. Also  the location is a little sketchy... a lot of people hanging around looking at you like chum if you re out of place. As long as the quality was a blip  it s still hard to beat 2 tasty tacos for  3.
Taqueria Gardenia,32,This place is so good  I had the barbacoa  carnitas and al pastor. Reminds me of a little taco spot in Baja California. They fry up their tortillas a little bit and its makes them even more delicious. Definitely would go back if I was in the area 
Taqueria Gardenia,33,This taco truck is awesome.  The tortillas are freshly made and everything we had was delicious.  We had pastor and bistek tacos and a bistek burrito. The man working there was very friendly and there was a little Hispanic lady cooking the food.  CASH ONLY.
Taqueria Gardenia,34,The lady working was nice  and the breakfast tacos were tasty. The cilantro was a nice touch  too. I think she charged me more for breakfast tacos  though  since it was 6pm.  Menu says they serve breakfast until 11  I think.  Whatevs. I got breakfast tacos. I m happy.
Taqueria Gardenia,35,Solid taco truck for authentic tacos  The first time I came I got el pastor tacos and they were superb. Also enjoyed eating the barbocoa  but I prefer el pastor. Two dollars per taco  truck owner is super nice and friendly and always has a smile.
Super Burrito on 5th,1,Best breakfast burrito I ve had in a long time. Flavor on the steak and chicken tacos is amazing too.  Hot sauce is HOT.  Friendly and quick
Super Burrito on 5th,2,I finally went to Super Burrito on Taco Tuesday.  I ve always had a burrito when I ve ordered from there  but half price tacos are hard to resist.  Their tacos are definitely hard to resist.  Not sure how the same things in a smaller tortilla seem to taste that much better  but they did.  I m still a little disappointed with their salsa.  I ll just have to drown my sorrows in another taco.
Super Burrito on 5th,3,For a food truck burrito  this was pretty great  We stopped here on our peddle pub and I can t tell you of a better food truck burrito that I ve had.  I went with the veggie bean and cheese burrito as I was getting tired of a ton of meat. It did not disappoint  Super gooey and delicious. My wife got the carne asada fries. Both excellent choices. I finished it out with a churro and couldn t have been happier   A great stop for a quick burrito and churro. Highly recommend.
Super Burrito on 5th,4,Customer Service 4 Quality Temp 4 Price Portion 4 Likelihood to return 3 1-5  5 Best   3.8  I used Lunch drop to bring my lunch today.  First time trying Super Burrito.  I ordered Super Nachos Beef  and a Chicken Taco.  The nachos were made with steak  not beef.  I should have investigated more.  They were good  but not what I was thinking they would be.  The chicken taco was loaded.  It was marinated in a yellow sauce.    The food was VERY good quality  fresh  and tasty.  My taste buds didn t connect with the food  only because of MY preferences.  Support Local   
Super Burrito on 5th,5,I was craving a burrito so I stopped by the smallest bar in Texas to give Super Burrito a try. I went with the asada super burrito and was excited to eat since I was so hungry. When I think of burritos I think of something firm I m able to hold in my hand and eat without a problem. The burrito I got was a bit runny so it was hard for the burrito to stay together. The tortilla wasn t tightly wrapped. The burrito didn t have much flavor and I didn t get any sauces on the side to put over my burrito.
Super Burrito on 5th,6,The super burrito was delicious. Had the right amount of ingredients and tasted flavorful and fresh.  Will be ordering again.
Super Burrito on 5th,7,If you re a true San Diegan  do not go here. You ll be full of nothing but disappointment knowing that some things simply can t be duplicated.
Super Burrito on 5th,8,You simply can t get a decent burrito in Austin. It ain t a thing. I used to rely on this spot for the closest alternative to a Cali burrito  but what arrived today was sadness. I threw it out half way through.  It was a Super Burrito  but the inside of the tortilla was just ground beef and refriend beans... that s it. Everything else that comes with the burrito was  on the side  in containers - wtf.  It always was soft and sloppy and not that great  even when I parceled in the condiments and items missing from within. It was a waste of money and I regret it. I ll never order from here  or anywhere else in Austin  ever again. I guess I m on my own to roll my own burrito or only enjoy one when I m traveling. Bummer.
Super Burrito on 5th,9,Seriously insanely good burritos. Don t order one if you don t have an appetite though.
Super Burrito on 5th,10,These guys are friendly and make great San D Ahhh-Go burritos. Carne Asada Fries are also bomb.
Super Burrito on 5th,11,I ve had the SD buritto  amp  a few tacos here on a couple different trips.  I ll say the buritto was pretty good  definitely closer to the Baja  CA style of buritto I ve seen in Austin.  My favorite taco was the sea monster.  Easy spot to come check out.
Super Burrito on 5th,12,The truck looks really random but we got the poblano burrito and it was actually really tasty  Would highly recommend stopping by if you re in the area
Super Burrito on 5th,13,Pretty solid burrito. The  1 off coupon from Yelp was a win  Calamari   potatoes   coleslaw   chipotle is a very good mix for feeling satisfied. The tortilla was good and stretchy. Beware everything will probably fall out but that doesn t make it less tasty 
Super Burrito on 5th,14,90  of the days I spend in Austin I spend here for at least one meal. It is my tradition to step off the plane and go here - best tacos in Texas  
Super Burrito on 5th,15,I moved here from San Diego about 12 years ago and was dying due to lack of real carne asada. Living near the border spoils you when it comes to Mexican food so when I got to Austin I was majorly disappointed  the Tex mex is good don t worry people . One day my friend who moved with me called.  I found it  he said.  Found what   I replied.  A California burrito   I didn t believe him until I showed up to super burrito. This is the one spot in Austin that I ve found legit carne asada and if you know about the  California burrito  then you must give it a try. It s a little pricey compared to SD I ll admit but it s as close to the same exact burrito as you can get. Point is  when I need a taste of the best Mexican food I run to super burrito.  Here s another story. I was dating a girl from El Paso. We used to always argue about who had better Mexican food. Was it El Paso or was it San Diego  One day I took her to super burrito and this was her comment   it s just like El Paso   I laughed because it was just like San Diego  Apparently they are very similar for you real Texans. Give this place a try    My only complaint is that I DO wish they had a brick and mortar again instead of the food truck that is super hard to access with parking. I also feel the quality went down a bit since moving into the food truck. They just need to reopen a location and put a ton of social media buzz behind it to let the world know about this hidden gem.
Super Burrito on 5th,16,I had the potato egg and cheese burrito  I m vegetarian ... and there wasn t cheese. which might ve been fine  except that I don t think the potatoes or eggs were seasoned whatsoever. It was just SO BLAND. I m sure their burritos with meat are very flavorful  but I wish they made sure that all their menus items tasted good... vegetarians deserve to enjoy eating too lol
Super Burrito on 5th,17,Cute food truck next to an Italian truck and the tiniest bar in Texas  so it does make for a nice stop to get food and drinks. I got a Tejana and their complementary sauces were good with a kick.  The tacos were a good size and will definitely fill you up  but it didn t blow me away. I only had one taco  so maybe the other tacos were better. There was an outdoor seating area which was nice  but besides the local business aspect  I wasn t super impressed.
Super Burrito on 5th,18,GREAT Mexican food. I ordered their chicken nacho fries and a San Diego burrito  contains french fries  and I was not disappointed. It s hard to find a good burrito in Texas  so I was happy that I found one here. I will definitely be back again and again.
Super Burrito on 5th,19,So don t get me wrong  I was excited to have a little taste of home aka San Diego in ATX but I ve had very different experiences going 2 times so far. I ve tried the San Diego burrito and the carne asada fries and I think the main issue is inconsistency with their French fries.  SD burrito  the French fries were way over seasoned and over cooked and the carne asada was a bit chewy - eek Carne asada fries  were muuuuch better and their saving grace but the fries were a bit undercooked  see picture . The carne asada was much better and it all went together very nicely. Also  their carne asada fries don t come with pico de gallo  so I would strongly suggest adding that.  I will be back 
Super Burrito on 5th,20,California claims without the California quality  and this critique is coming from a native Mexican-American Californian    The meat was dry  chewy  and the all around flavor of the burrito was bland.  The size of the burrito was laughable  being that I ve had larger frozen burritos from a grocery store.  To receive such poor quality coming from a placed called  SUPER BURRITO  is embarrassing and lazy. I won t be trying them again.  If you want a solid burrito with proper size  flavor  and texture akin to what you d get from a taqueria in the SF Mission District  I recommend a truck called Taco Brother on Brodie Lane near William Cannon.  It s kinda far south  but WOW do they do a burrito right 
Super Burrito on 5th,21,OMG  tan bueno. this mexican taco burrito nachos  etc truck is FANTASTIC   it s in the patio section of the tiniest bar of texas on 5th street and on the side of whole foods  next to the bowie high rise    i got 2 tacos the tejano taco...steak  pico and avacado the a.m. taco...sausage  potato  cheese  with red and green sauce   these tacos were awesome. i live in galveston and was so glad that i tried this place  FREE WiFI...password is sandiego  BUY LOCAL SUPPORT LOCAL
Super Burrito on 5th,22,This place came highly recommended by one of my buddies. Very cool location attached to the same lot as the Tiniest Bar in Texas  just a little hut that serves cocktails  beers  whatever you re feeling.  Talk about Super Burrito  this place delivers when it comes to being filling as well as the quality of the burrito. Hands-down easily a top 10 burrito place in my books  I could see this place possibly starting a brick  amp  mortar shop one day. We each got a different burrito  but all were great  I don t think you can go wrong at SB 
Super Burrito on 5th,23,Was missing California burritos so I tried the San Diego burrito from here and was quite disappointed. The meat had an odd taste  the fries were completely soggy and also had an odd taste  there was just something very off about the taste of everything. The chips and queso were also pretty mediocre but better than the burrito.
Super Burrito on 5th,24,Good tacos - also breakfast tacos any time of the day. So the tacos are good. Not great  but not bad either - just good. You can find good tacos in a  lot  of places in Austin  but then again  there are also a lot of  bad  tacos to be had in Austin - so yeah  it s good to know that these are good. The key tho  is to not worry about the menu - order them the way _you_ want them   carnitas  with avocado and no onions   or whatever  - and enjoy. Incidentally  you can get breakfast tacos any time of the day  and these are  good    Lastly  there is a pleasant outdoor area  where you can grab a drink from the nearby  smallest bar in texas   and chill to music.
Super Burrito on 5th,25,I miss Cali burritos so I m glad this place offers them   San Diego burrito . I got mine with chicken  my fianc  got his with the normal carne asada. He used to eat Cali burritos weekly so he devoured his with no complaints  Mine was decent and came with guacamole inside. Chicken could have been slightly better  but for being in Texas  we will definitely be coming back for more  Glad they are open during COVID as well
Super Burrito on 5th,26,I would not recommend this place at all at 9 30 I been trying to call them to place an order to go and they didn t answer and I drove there 18 min away to just get their burritos and I go to the window and they guys is like we closed they close 10 min before closing and I even told him I drove from far to just get get y all s burrito but still the guy said we already cleaning the grill which they haven t started u til 2 min of me asking and waisted my freaking time to just get their freaking food and now most of place close and I should have not went with them and the guy and window was so rude that I been there many times but now screw them of how they talk and don t care about their customer and really I would recommend stay away from this place and they are so rude to u as they should welcome each customer
Super Burrito on 5th,27,I m from San Diego  Ca and I love good food. While in Austin  I heard about this spot so I decided to try. I bought the  San Diego  burrito aka THE CALIFORNIA BURRITO for  9.49.  First  the burrito is a lot smaller than expected although its in an OVERSIZED tortilla which is what filled me up... NOT much carne asada was in my burrito  the guacamole didn t taste homemade  the fries are the string fries NOT regular sized fries that we use in SD.  I also ordered a  2.75 churro. Unbelievably disappointed as there was NO SUGAR OR CINNAMON on my churro but it did have some type of filling    I fed it the local birds.... not sure why that s called a  churro  but that s what I got when I ordered a  churro .   Overall it was ok but not sure if I d return.
Super Burrito on 5th,28,As a visitor to Austin  I ve found that the supply of Mexican food is saturated.  This quick stop food truck has ample outdoor seating and was a solid mid week  middle of the day lunch option.  This place was particularly quick in putting the order together probably less than five minutes.  I ordered a breakfast burrito because it was one of the only options with Chorizo on the menu.  The other burrito was al pastor because the savory pork worms with the sweet pineapple.  Also got a side of hot sauce.   Definitely great price and well worth it.  Would go back if I could.
Super Burrito on 5th,29,Yoooo I am super stoked about my dinner tonight. I am in the  eat and drink togo texas page  on facebook and someone was looking for a  California burrito  which id never heard of but learned it has fries amongst a few other things in it. Being a huge fan of gyros with fries in them  I was automatically interested. 90  of the group recommended super burrito for your California burrito fix so I ordered the san Diego burrito with a side of beans and chips and queso.... one of the BEST burritos I ve ever eaten. I used to cook for a taco truck and our burritos were my fav until this. Damn yall  just try the San Diego burrito and be happy.   I ordered this on Doordarsh btw and got it quickly and it was super fresh.
Super Burrito on 5th,30,Super cool outside dinning at this location  but parking might be tricky. We ordered the carne Asada fries and with a tip it was about  9.50. The fries were super good. Loaded with meat but too much meat that s why I gave them 3 stars but it would be a solid. The meat was kind of dry and had a lot of pepper so maybe if you asked for fries and a little bit of meat it would be even better. The fries come with guacamole  sour cream  and green  amp  red salsa. A good snack and easily shareable between 2-3 people
Super Burrito on 5th,31,Absolutely delicious. All of our tacos were juicy and enormous. We went on taco Tuesday so each taco was only  2. Great deal  We ll be back
Super Burrito on 5th,32,It s pretty hard to mess up a breakfast burrito  and at around  6.50  Super Burrito has it s pricing right. Unfortunately  the breakfast burrito with bacon I had was pretty flavorless  and they didn t throw any hot sauce in the bag. Went back today for the steak breakfast burrito and it wasn t much better  but at least I had hot sauce today. There must be better Mexican food in town  but this works in a pinch.
Super Burrito on 5th,33,I guess I m not cultured enough to realize the magnitude of other burrito places but this one did the damn job in my opinion. We ordered breakfast delivery and I got presented with the tastiest breakfast burrito that ever lived. Eggs  cheese  potatoes wrapped up in a perfectly warm tortilla. A side of chips and queso  Yes please  the queso was so good I could drink it. The green spicy salsa to put on top of burrito  Dank sauce.  10 10 or 5 5  whatever  get yourself a casual burrito here 
Super Burrito on 5th,34,I have ordered from this Food Truck at least 5 times via Postmates. My personal favorite has to be the San Diego Burrito. Also  don t miss out on the Cream Filled Churros  All in all  Super Burrito on 5th is hands down the best burrito spot in Austin. Don t miss out 
Super Burrito on 5th,35,I m not a burrito fan but my Uber driver recommended and they were good. I had the fried calamari chipotle and it was exploding with flavor. Also had this steak one with fries-liked it best. Too many places to eat here to go back but it was pretty decent for  9 each.
Super Burrito on 5th,36,This place has been bookmarked for quite some time and we finally came to try it and it did not disappoint.  I tried the Texas burrito and my wife got the Super Burrito.  We also split a Sea Monster taco.  Everything was spot on.  The prices are very good and the food came out incredibly fast.  The orange salsa was delicious and reminded me of the salsas from the taco shops in California.  The white sauce on the sea monster was amazing.  The breaded shrimp had a great crunch to it as well.   I can t wait to co.e back to try some of the other burritos as well as the breakfast items.  They do not serve any drinks  but you can get drinks at the Tiniest Bar in Texas right next door.  There are benches and tables to sit at  with music to enjoy while you devour your burrito.  I think the super nachos or carne asada fries might be next on my list here.
Super Burrito on 5th,37,I so badly wanted to like this place. My husband and I were super excited to finally find a place that served a California Burrito  here dubbed a San Diego Burrito  and Carne Asada Fries since leaving California  so of course we had to try it out. My husband ordered the San Diego Burrito and I ordered the Carne Asada Fries  both which looked very appetizing. However  neither of us could get passed the carne asada. It was unpleasantly chewy and very very...peppery  My guacamole didn t taste  or look  fresh. The prices are pretty steep. You can get a much larger California Burrito for roughly  7 or less in California. Overall  the food was underwhelming. I am rating it 3 stars because the service was fast and friendly. Our order was out in roughly 3 to 4 minutes. I appreciated the shaded seating areas. I also liked the salsa. The search for an authentic California Burrito continues 
Super Burrito on 5th,38,wow even the Austin Tx police squad eats delicious here ... Thank you for keeping us safe  we thank you from the bottom of our hearts ...
Super Burrito on 5th,39,Let me start by saying I love this place but I ve only had one thing on the menu    CARNE FRIES      Get them. You won t be sorry.   Just ask for no paper in your box. Not sure when they started doing that but they should stop ASAP.
Super Burrito on 5th,40,Christians have Heaven Muslims islamic have Mecca  Buddhists got Buddha  Mormons got... whatever tf their up to  And alas  I have Super Burrito  I d take a small caliber round to the hip for this food.  But in reality  that bullet will surely be penetrated closer to the cardiac region. I digress  Fare the well  and until next time  my French fry impregnated maiden.  We shall meet again  Silly goose burrito  more like it
Super Burrito on 5th,41,Austin has A LOT of options for tacos and burritos so you need to bring your A game. This is not A game material. I ordered the Super Burrito and Chips and Queso... the chicken sort of tasted like it had curry seasoning -- which was odd in this context and the queso was white velveeta. Do better.
Super Burrito on 5th,42,Best burrito I ve ever had. The red salsa has legit heat. They aren t scared of the people who can t handle spice. I eat here 2-3 times a week.
Super Burrito on 5th,43,I got the Jolly Green Giant. It was awesome   Great combo. It came out super hot and super tasty 
Super Burrito on 5th,44,Horrible asada fries. Nope nope nope. Not ever coming back. I miss the Oltorf location. 1 star bc the girl was really nice. But food is not good.
Super Burrito on 5th,45,I got the San Diego Burrito and it is really good. Only place in Austin to get that style of burrito and it comes in a good portion size with some salsas.
Super Burrito on 5th,46,Nice little food truck with friendly service. They have wide assortment of burritos.  The burritos are large and filling.  I had the California burrito with fries  asada  and the works.  It was large enough that I could not finish it.  If you are looking for cheap eats  it is a pretty good deal.  The burrito was decent but nothing made it standout from the numerous other Mexican food trucks in town.
Super Burrito on 5th,47,Ended up getting an order of the super burrito and the super nachos.  Both were super big and very filling.  Wife had the nachos and I had the burrito.  Both of had leftovers for the next day.  Give it a try you won t regret it.
Super Burrito on 5th,48,My boyfriend and I stopped by for lunch today. The name of the food truck might be  Super Burrito  but honestly there was nothing super about their food. We spent  20 on two burritos which were extremely bland. I wouldn t eat there again.
Super Burrito on 5th,49,I never give 5 s but everything about this truck is right for me. Drinks at the tiniest bar in Texas  I always drink and use their seating  I always order the San Diego which is Fuego. Their red and green salsa is super fire  wtf... also  put your cell phone number in when you re filling out the bs on their iPad  hella rewards and they don t expire. I m sitting on a ton. Also   20 free stars  points if you join the mailing list  and their email blasts consist of coupon codes ONLY reminding you about them which is also another big win. Lol this place is bomb.
Super Burrito on 5th,50,Pretty unremarkable. I had to order twice since they gave my Favor runner the wrong food. I was pretty excited for what had been described as a  solid burrito  but instead was let down. The steak was overcooked and served so scalding  piping hot that it turned the pico de gallo into half-cooked tomato sauce. Burritos are a delicate balance  and these folks just didn t get it right.
Super Burrito on 5th,51,Great place for a quick meal  I got the San Diego burrito and it is so filling   In a good way  delicious for sure   
Super Burrito on 5th,52,I finally found a place in Austin that serves California burritos like San Diego  appropriately named the San Diego burrito here   It successfully satisfied my craving for non-TexMex Mexican food. Now  I usually don t finish an entire burrito in one sitting  but it s been a while so naturally  I devoured it. And felt disgusting with myself after. But it was worth it.   The burrito is filled all kinds of deliciousness  Mexican rice  guacamole  salsa  cheese  carne asada  and French fries. Please tell me someone drooled just reading that. You should.   The burritos here are a bit pricey though. I m used to paying around 7-8 for a burrito. Here it s almost  10. Just something to consider.
Super Burrito on 5th,53,Ordered a pastor burrito today. It was the 1st time and the last time I ll order from this place. I felt fine before lunch. Ate the burrito and have felt like  h   since then. I m sure they used something that was at its expiration or had gone bad. Typical. If my condition worsens I will pay a visit to the location.
Super Burrito on 5th,54,Back in the day I went to school in La Jolla and fell in love with the San Diego style burrito. Hard to go back to beans and rice as a filler when you ve had crispy french fries instead. After leaving SD I ve been hard pressed to find a good re-creation outside the city. Super Burrito was the first spot that does this fine delicacy justice. If you are looking for a good burrito in Austin make this your first stop 
Super Burrito on 5th,55,Maybe I got something wrong  But from a non-meat eater perspective  and dairy  maybe this place isn t meant for us folk. I got the nachos with refried beans  pico  quac and jalapenos. I felt the nachos were flavorless from beginning to end. I have done these types of nachos at various places and they have had flavor on their own. I was hoping the beans would have enough flavor to stand out and be delish.. but nope.   I do see that the San Marcos and other Austin location have more to offer. I did ask for Bell peppers on my nachos and I was told they didn t have that.. even though it was on their menu. So unfortunately I can not say this is a great place to eat .. but I see other people love this place. Plus I feel like I wasted  9.69 of my money.. like I wish I could get a refund.. but oh well 
Super Burrito on 5th,56,Just ordered the San Diego burrito off Uber EATS and boy it was delicious and way too filling..  The burrito came ripped apart because it was too stuffed so it was a pain to eat and the meat wasn t all that flavorful but I loved the healthy amount of cilantro  queso fresco  and sour cream -- also the french fries were a fun addition.   Definitely worth the money
Super Burrito on 5th,57,2nd time been here i have the california fries they were good the only thing I have to say that California fries it would be taste better if it was a fresh guacamole it didn t taste like fresh to me it is more artificial guacamole I am at some onions and lemon squish and jalape os to my California fries they taste really good.
Super Burrito on 5th,58,Stopped by to get the Texas burrito for lunch and it changed my life  SO good  They were also extremely nice and quick  My burrito was ready by the time I finished paying. That s service  There is street parking  but I wasn t sure and parked in the parking lot near the Starbucks. Pretty sure I wasn t supposed to  but they were so quick it was fine     It was around  9  but the burrito was huge and I couldn t finish it. It has carne asada  potatoes  cheese  pico  sour cream  and guacamole in a chipotle tortilla  Had just the right amount spice. They included sauce in my bag  but I didn t even need it. Love this place  Will be sure to grab lunch whenever I m in a rush or craving the best burrito of my life 
Super Burrito on 5th,59,My first meal in Austin was the Texas Burrito - it was fantastic and filled me up perfectly.  Service was friendly and super fast too.  I tried both the hot and medium salsa  I preferred the hot but both were delicious.
Super Burrito on 5th,60,Not good. Food had no flavor  I was so excited to try this place because how good it looked but looks can be deceiving  They at least refunded me some of my money. But I definitely will not be back.
Super Burrito on 5th,61,I love their breakfast tacos  It s been a while since I ve ordered from here  and this morning started off on the wrong start  I walked away with the potato taco and chicken taco noticing the bag was a bit heavier than usual  only to find they added an extra taco for free. Not sure why  but it really made me smile. Thank you 
Super Burrito on 5th,62,Being a California native and reading reviews that the owners are from CA I was very excited  beyond words  to check this place out and I ended up very disappointed after tasting the food. The carne asada was very bland  lacked flavor and salt. I figured this was an easy fix  so I asked for lime wedges  like they actually give you in CA when you order street tacos etc.  but I was told they didn t have any lime wedges. My husband went back to ask for salt to  fix  how bland the meat was - they told us they didn t have salt. Sigh. So you know  I ordered the super burrito with carne asada as my choice of meat  2 carne asada street tacos with corn tortillas  1 shredded chicken street taco on flour and an order of carne asada fries. The only taco with flavor was the shredded chicken taco my 4 yo. son had  but it was a little spicy so he struggled eating it . The burrito had beans that tasted as if they came from a can - goopy. Even our fries lacked any type of season such as seasoning salt or regular. I think you guys get the picture - it lacked salt and flavor. It s an easy fix but will they take the time to listen  Marinate your meat at minimum for 4-5 hrs  use lime when marinating  salt and garlic salt or powder. Offer lime wedges for those that want a tangy meat flavor and please purchase small individual salt and pepper packages or have one consumers may use at their leisure. I m not sure if I ll be back  I m still debating but as of now probably not. I m from LA so maybe this place is good if you ve never had CA   LA real street tacos. Check them out on your own and be your own judge - don t take my word for it but read the review of a person that actually knows and has a pallet for street tacos - the real kind.  I didn t mean to make this review negative  so here are some pros  Polite guy took our order  amp  took the time to read it back to ensure accuracy - big KUDOS  Very fast service  food was ready in less than 6 minutes They gave us a good enough amount of napkins and utensils  They gave us a lot of salsas   Try the green one it was delicious  
Super Burrito on 5th,63,So awesome to find a unique burrito place here. There s plenty of taco stands in town but these are big old burritos  So don t let the price freak you out. It s worth the money for the size. You ll only need one  or less than one. I tried the calamari burrito and it was lovely. Fresh cabbage  crispy fried calamari  and spicy mayo. 10 10 will eat again  especially after a few beers at Tinniest Bar.
Super Burrito on 5th,64,I searched Yelp for  California burrito  and this place popped up. It s not close to where I live  but was worth the journey. It definitely satisfied my craving and I plan on returning
Super Burrito on 5th,65,Cali style food. Burritos are huge and stuffed with a  lot of meat. I tried the San Diego burrito and it was delicious  It was filled with carne asada  grilled beef steak   French fries  sour cream  guacamole  pico de gio  and cheese. Hot and fresh. Def a must try  very good  
Super Burrito on 5th,66,My wife and I are traveling through town and decided to order in as we didn t feel up to going out. Selecting this restraint was a huge mistake. The food arrived very timely but it was huge disappointment.  The chips were stale  the guacamole was brown  the fries were old.  Food very much felt like false advertising.   Also the burrito which was not supposed to have guacamole also had very brown guacamole included.   I cannot encourage people enough to stay away from here.
Super Burrito on 5th,67,Ordered a bean and cheese burrito via Uber Eats. I was hoping for beans and a reasonable amount of cheese with some guac  pico de gallo  and rice. What I got was a pile of overly cheesy mush in a soggy tortilla. Also got chips and queso. Queso was okay but nothing to write home about. Chips were standard. Overall gets a big shrug from me.
Super Burrito on 5th,68,I went to SDSU and am from Cali-so of course I was stoked to have a piece of home  No lime wedges.....no salt...I was so confused and my heart was broken into a million pieces. It s good for drunk food but I won t be ordering again...the meat was bland and the fries just don t do it for me. GET SOME LIMES and some Mexican Coke 
Super Burrito on 5th,69,This trailer sized burrito truck is everything chipotle wishes it could be.  1. Delicious and doused in cheese  2. Awesome customer service and speed  3. Huge menu options  breakfast to vegetarian to seafood.  All are made fresh and tasty tasty  Will come back again
Super Burrito on 5th,70,The San Diego burrito here does no justice to the authentic burritos you can find in San Diego. I ve been told this is the only place in Austin you can find such a burrito though  so I ll give them that.   For almost  10 what you receive in a San Diego burrito from here is an overload of French fries  a lack of carne asada  and an underwhelming amount of guacamole. All three ingredients that must be proportional in order for a California burrito to be enjoyable. Not to mention this burrito is on average  7-8 in San Diego anywhere you go  maybe even less AND for something extremely bigger. This is an extremely underwhelming burrito  but at least they re making it  I guess 
Super Burrito on 5th,71,They are fast  under a minute sometimes . They are cheap  all tacos are 2 dollars on Tuesdays . The employees are kind.  Quantity is more than fair.
Super Burrito on 5th,72,NO CAPES   It s close and delicious  a winning combination for me.  These guys can put a burrito together faster than Gump can put a rifle together.  Super Burrito has carte blanche access to my wallet.  Huge fan of the Texas Cheesesteak burrito but for the most part I enjoy the simplicity of the shredded chicken Super Burrito.  Maybe I ll venture out and try other things on the menu but once I find what I like  I find it hard to stray.
Super Burrito on 5th,73,One of my favorite places for a quick taco. Hard to beat breakfast tacos all day  especially at  2.59 each  my favorites are the am and the champ.  cute outdoor seating area with bar nearby. Only complaint is they are not open before work.
Super Burrito on 5th,74,I loved them when they used be located on oltorf and now I m happy to have found them again   I love to order the signature super burrito with carne asada  so tender 
Super Burrito on 5th,75,I never got to experience their food.  I actually planned my Austin trip from Dallas to eat here  because I m from California and I REALLY missed Carne Asada fries and saw this place was the only place that basically had them in all of Texas. So I planned a trip all the way to Austin to come here and have their California fries.   Over the weekend I came here with my sister and we were walking in downtown Austin and we saw the place  but we weren t really hungry at the moment. So I walked over there and I asked the worker what time they closed that day  and the person said 6. So that was perfect.   We went around Austin for a few hours and it s almost 5  so my sister and I decided to start walking over to the food truck  I forgot to mention  we were only staying in Austin for one day . We saw the food truck was about 20 ft away from us  and I looked at my phone for the time and it was 5 14p.m.  and we were SUPER hungry from walking around everywhere all day  and when we got to the truck to order their California fries  everything was locked up and their  Open  sign was off and no one was there.   My sister and I were somewhat shocked. Because we planned this WHOLE trip soley to have their California fries  and they have such great reviews on here  and they LIED to us     I felt shattered  because if you re from Calirfornia  you know Carne Asada fries is basically life haha and I was really hurt they lied to us about the time they closed. Not to mention I was starving  so I was hangry. So was my sister. So even though we did other nice things during our day  our trip was basically a ruined now because we couldn t have their food.   That also says something to me about their customer service  they didn t care about the customer and just said whatever  whether because either they didn t care  or they didn t know  in which case they should ve asked to make sure.   I was really sad  and most definitely will not be returning  because I m moving back to California in about a month  where I can have some real carne asada fries  and most food places in California close around 2 a.m. Yay   D
Super Burrito on 5th,76,That s gonna be a no from me. Grilled chicken was liiiike....The pre cooked stuff you get out of a plastic package from Safeway and it was seasoned with a microwave and black pepper only. Did I go on an  off day  maybe   The rest of the insides were a not so savory mix of rice  plain white    and refried beans and mystery.  Pros it was food and the tortilla was good.
Super Burrito on 5th,77,Shocking to see this place only has 3.5 stars  Visiting Austin with some friends  and our Airbnb host recommended. In situations like these  I m kind of glad I didn t check yelp first to see what their overall rating is because I would definitely have pushed it aside.   We went at 12 30am  on a Friday night  because we thought we were going to go out  but we got really hungry and decided to eat instead. I think they close shortly after us though  so at 1am  Not sure why it says 10pm closing    Pre-informed biases aside  this place has the bet burrito I ve ever had in my entire life. First of all  I don t even like burritos because I sometimes feel like it s too much tortilla and slim fillings. Needless to say  this burrito did not have excess tortilla wrapping when I got to the bottom. It was evenly and strategically folded - there was never a point where I felt like I took a bite of 50  or more of purely tortilla and no stuff. Secondly  the  inside  was mixed very well. I got the Texas  and my meat  cheese  potatoes  comes w skin   and guac were all nicely mixed together  aka not just a bite of only potatoes  etc. Third  my burrito was so flavorful  it was like getting punched in the mouth with spices. Makes me wonder if the other reviews are reviewing the right cart   And lastly  it was PIPING HOT even down to the last bite  not hot enough to burn my mouth of course   so that definitely kept the entire burrito satisfactory.  Overall  a great experience  and I would definitely go again. It s like they have it down to a science.
Super Burrito on 5th,78,Me and my husband were  super excited to get some real Cali burritos  but what we got didn t even come close  So we got the super burrito first off the fries tasted like they were reheated in the microwave from last night  The Carne Asada taste like peppered beef from china town  The food was tasteless  and nothing tasted fresh. I will never come back here again  and I do not recommend this place  I d give this place 2 stars only because they did have a lot of meat in the burrito and tacos 
Super Burrito on 5th,79,Delicious breakfast tacos and amazing salsa   Definitely recommend if you re in the area 
Super Burrito on 5th,80,Super Burrito is a great food truck  tucked away on the west side of downtown. Never a long line  so a perfect option if you re in a rush. Highly recommend the Chipotle Calamari burrito for dinner  or if you re there for breakfast the AM  with the AM - add a sauce  like chipotle .
Super Burrito on 5th,81,So I convince my partner to move here from Southern California  which has tons of restaurants that serve California Burritos  WITH FRENCH FRIES . Do you know how difficult it is to find a restaurant that will put fries on a burrito in Austin  It s very difficult...until we found this gem. It s a little food truck off 5th near Whole Foods and the San Diego burrito did not disappoint. It was fat and loaded with all the Southern California goodness that we remembered and I m so glad that there is at least one Mexican restaurant in Austin that puts fries in their burritos.
Super Burrito on 5th,82,After trying Lucky s Puccia s and Austin Habibi  I was looking forward to trying Super Burrito since its two neighbors are amazing  but I was a bit underwhelmed. Got the Super Burrito with steak and a chipotle tortilla  and grabbed a mexican coke from the bar. The steak was actually pretty good  but the burrito was actually a bit too cheesy for my taste. Mind you  I love cheese  but all I tasted was cheese and meat with the texture of rice. There was guac in there too  but again I couldn t taste it. Taking into account the price  I d call this place pretty average for a food truck. It s definitely good  but nothing out of this world.
Super Burrito on 5th,83,Really impressed by the food trailer here  wasn t quite sure what to expect given the location .  We recently moved to Austin and this trailer is literally next door to us in a small lot with a few trucks trailers so I see us coming back often   Split the Texas Burrito and the Pollo Asado Burrito and neither of us could decide which we liked more.  The Texas Burrito was a bit soupier with a delicious mushroom sauce  the Pollo Asado was just the right consistency and flavor. The time it took to cook it from scratch was a bit longer than I had expected but was truly worth the wait.    Reading through some of the other reviews here  I m looking forward to trying other burritos  churros and fries 
Super Burrito on 5th,84,I looked on the Internet for their menu and seeing how great everything looked  I went to try it.I ordered the  Cali fries not good at all   very dry and needed sone salt badly. I also ordered a gyro burrito and that as well was horrible. The little sitting area was very sad and depressed looking.
Super Burrito on 5th,85,I ve had the Jolly Green Giant  their vegan offering  about 4 times I think. I substitute fries for the potatoes  and it s just absolutely delicious.   Pretty great little trailer in a convenient spot near Whole Foods and Trader Joe s downtown. I expect I ll be back often.
Super Burrito on 5th,86,This mom and pop restaurant has to have the most delicious carne asada burritos I have ever tasted.  They don t skimp on quality ingredients and the quantity of meat in their food.  Plus  they are cheap   It s the best of all worlds   My favorite is their Texas Burrito which has carne asada  potatoes  cheese  pico de gallo  and guacamole in a chipotle tortilla.  Are you drooling yet 
Super Burrito on 5th,87,I just ordered from uber eats. A few things 1. I hate when places have items with fries  like carne Asada fries  but can t offer fries a la carte  What s up with that  Also  the queso is  in fact  a ripoff. I thought maybe the past post was a one off but the queso amount is what makes this review a 3. Wish I had gone to torchys 
Super Burrito on 5th,88,My flautas in my burrito was burnt void of flavor and over priced      Not even what i odered   Food sucks
Super Burrito on 5th,89,I paid  2  for queso on my nachos and got the tiniest drizzle of it  so that I could barely tell that there was queso on them at all. I asked if I could have more because I couldn t even really tell there was queso on them  and the woman working there told me it was a standard amount of queso and just shook her head. A clearly disappointed customer shouldn t be treated this way. Ironically  they have a  yelp us  sign out front. I intend to yelp  Zomato  and google review them. It s not worth losing customers to be cheap like that. Also the guacamole sucks. The  carne asada  came in little pellets. I wouldn t even eat such bad Mex food in Dallas  much less Austin. This place is a disgrace.
Super Burrito on 5th,90,I ordered through postmates while I m about 15 min away and the food was still piping hot. I tried all 3 tacos other than the street and rate them on par with most other Austin taco joints. I ll probably come back
Super Burrito on 5th,91,This place hits the spot   I can eat it everyday. Only problem is I wish it opened earlier.
Super Burrito on 5th,92,I got the car nice out of fries after I asked a lady where they were from. There from California. Finally I can have carne asada fries. They are okay. Not bad. It s a good start   amp  I hope more places will start to make more carne asada fries. They re not hard to do  I don t know why it s not popular enough here its always hatch chili this hatch chili that..
Super Burrito on 5th,93,Super Burrito.... meh. I really wanted to enjoy this place  but frankly I had a very underwhelming burrito.  I tried the San Diego burrito  but I ended up throwing away half of it because it just wasn t worth finishing.  I will say that the burrito was HUGE  I would have struggled to finish this had I actually enjoyed the meal  so that s something. My particular burrito was very heavy on the fries  with a small amount of beef  and I couldn t find any guac . That s not a good start  but I like fries so I figured no big deal.... until I took the second bite  and realized my fries were very soggy- as if the oil wasn t hot enough before they were thrown in  I tried to power through  but I couldn t find a redeeming quality about the burrito   I will also say that the staff was very friendly at the window  but frankly if the food doesn t cut the mustard  what does the service matter  Since this place was in downtown Austin  A time consuming trip for me   I likely won t give it another chance... oh well
Super Burrito on 5th,94,I really wanted to like this place. I wanted it to fill my void for a good burrito like from San Diego. I ordered the San Diego burrito  obviously   the carne asada was really just over cooked steak and didn t have good flavor and the tortilla had a rubbery or waxy consistency instead of flakey. Otherwise it was good. I did get a breakfast taco too which was good.
Super Burrito on 5th,95,Philly Cheesesteak is a solid burrito.  Quick  and relatively cheap.  I ll be back fo sho 
Super Burrito on 5th,96,Boyfriend and I came here today   2 17 17  he ordered the San Diego Burrito and I ordered the Monster Nachos. Based on the reviews and us being from Houston we trusted yelp. Wrong  The Burrito was trash  the guac was old  the overall taste was not pleasing. The ingredients tasted old  The monster nachos were cold  The meat was cold  the beans under all the nachos were cold  It seemed like they warmed up old food and gave it to us. We ordered our meals and they were ready in less than 10 mins  not exaggerating either. My boyfriend ordered our food and went to the restroom and before he even got back both meals were done  Tell me that doesn t sound sketchy. I wouldn t recommend to go. We always try really good food trucks when we come to town but this was a disappointment. Never going back. Hoping neither of us get sick.
Super Burrito on 5th,97,Day two in Austin day two at super burrito  The Asada  shredded chicken and chicken street tacos are So Good Service is super fast and friendly. The Orange sauce a perfect compliment to the tacos with just the right amount of heat. We will be back for more.
Super Burrito on 5th,98,The last four visits have been very disappointing. I have been a faithful fan of super burrito since Last summer when I moved here to Austin. I m not sure what has been going on to bring their food quality down so far as it has but my last four visits I have received cold tacos with cheese that is no where near melting and my beef feels like it was almost right out of the fridge. Beware when you order a churro because they are not always fully fried and some may not come with cream. They also haven t been very generous with their cinnamon seasonins
Super Burrito on 5th,99,Really good and cheap  Quick option for lunch and dinner. They have breakfast tacos too. The super burrito is amazing  
Super Burrito on 5th,100,Heard about amazing Carne Asada fries and decided to trek down to find the truck on W 5th. Lady who took my order was very sweet and friendly. The menu was pretty expansive  every item sounded delicious. Sadly  was not impressed by the Carne Asada fries themselves. Wish there was more seasoning and or salt on the fries. The fries were really flimsy and not all that fried. Add to cheese and steak. Hefty amount of meat though which was awesome to see. Guacamole and sour cream and two small salsas  green and red. Overall  was bland and uninteresting. Decent amount of food downtown for  8.
Super Burrito on 5th,101,We loved the carne aside french fries.  Great little courtyard to eat in.  Great service for a food truck.  Would definitely visit again.
Super Burrito on 5th,102,Super awesome burrito. Seating is outside so be aware of that if it s hot. Other than that  it s one of my favorite burritos. Also check out the chips and queso  muy tasty
Super Burrito on 5th,103,This place used to be the best when they were located off of Oltorf.  I would come every Saturday morning for their  1 breakfast tacos.  They moved to a food truck which should have lowered their overhead  but their prices increased significantly   No more breakfast tacos for me from super burrito.
Super Burrito on 5th,104,Found this place on a whim. Heard a lot of great things about it and yes it s awesome. eggs  pottato  and cheese tacos are legit. The location is perfect in relation to whole foods  starbucks  and other find the establishments.
Super Burrito on 5th,105,This place is right outside my building so I eat here a ton. It s ready super fast and A  quality every time. I stick with breakfast tacos and the chicken one is the best. I ve got an ongoing debate amongst my friends about this  but I think it s better than Torchy s.
Super Burrito on 5th,106,For a satisfying late night meal  this place is perfect. The San Diego is a burrito with flavorful carne asada that s not gristly and French fries  The verde and red salsas also hit the spot. Tried a cream filled churro as well. It had good texture and was less sugary than most churros. Not a huge fan of the cream though. I ll be back for the cheap tacos.
Super Burrito on 5th,107,This is probably the worst taco food truck in austin. Their Carne Asada is terrible. I will not be coming back. Eat at Habibi if you are in the area and want a decent food truck
Super Burrito on 5th,108,I ordered the Texas Burrito and it was loaded with meat.  The service when I was there - admittedly early around 11 30am - was almost too fast.  My burrito was ready by about the time I was done paying.  I was almost suspicious that it had been made ahead of time but I ordered it without cheese and it was hot  fresh  and how I requested it so they just seem to be fast.  Our office just moved to the area so I now have a new place to go back to.
Super Burrito on 5th,109,Reminds me of SoCal Mexican food. Carne asada fries are legit  and so is the San Diego burrito. Needing better hot sauce would be my only gripe  but other than that it s really good.
Super Burrito on 5th,110,Pros - food was delicious and made quickly.  Location is perfect with outside eating area and near a bar.   Cons - I asked for military discount and the young girl said she didn t know instead of finding an answer. There was also a  1 off coupon near window on orders over  15. I noticed it after I already paid for the tab. I would ve thought she would mention the coupon. The burrito was a little small for  9.
Super Burrito on 5th,111,Great burritos. I recommend the Texas or the San Diego for starters. This place is quick and is heavy on the meat in their burritos. My one complaint would be the hours. While it s great to grab a super burrito as you sit at tiniest bar in Texas  patio  these burritos would make great late night food after a Saturday on West 6th.
Super Burrito on 5th,112,I had the calamari burrito and it was surprisingly tender and tasty.  The tortilla is soft and fresh  really enjoyed this place.
Super Burrito on 5th,113,Instead of super burrito it should be sloppy burrito. There was barely any meat or beans. Basically mush wrapped in a tortilla. A Huge WASTE 
Super Burrito on 5th,114,Another great spot for a burrito   Great outdoor seating and a full bart  Tiniest Bar . All the burritos on the menu are great. The Super Nachos with shredded chicken are amazing as well. The red hot sauce is spicey but delicious. Another great location for Super Burrito  
Super Burrito on 5th,115,I was so sad when the Oltorf location closed. I finally had the chance to try the food truck and it is just as good as the original was  - . The menu is condensed but they have most of my favorites  including their cheese stuffed poblano burrito and the wonderful California fries. The location in the Tiniest Bar in Texas is great  the bar is cozy  affordable  and has the best margaritas I ve had in Austin.  To sum up  Super Burrito is probably the best burrito place in Austin and you should definitely try it 
Super Burrito on 5th,116,Super good. Got the Pollo Asado burrito - chicken seasoned in something yellow and savory with sour cream and melted cheese.
Super Burrito on 5th,117,YUCK    I was starving- it was 1 30pm  I hadn t had dinner the night before  and had just a granola bar for breakfast- I threw half in the garbage. You re in Austin  you can do waaaaaayyyyyyy better than this place if you re looking for a burrito.
Super Burrito on 5th,118,Awesome food  customer service and the San Diego burrito is the best   I will definitely come back here more often  as I like to travel and taste different types of food  this is a great place 
Super Burrito on 5th,119,I could not decide between the calamari and veggie burrito. The owners said they were both popular and I decided upon the calamari with added guacamole and no potatoes. My partner and son both got the Pollo Asada  using the bogo Austin Passbook  and we ate at the Summer Concert Series at the Long Center. Perfect summmer picnic. My calamari was soooo delicious I could not stop talking about it. I am craving another the following day. My son said his looked unappealing but laughed and said it was awesome. Their red and green hot sauces were a nice surprise. Both spicy and super yummy. The Tiniest Bar is a great spot to eat them as well. Sure wish they had been there when we lived next door. Will be back 
Super Burrito on 5th,120,I have only ordered the tejana tacos but they are always amazing   And they are also served super hot  in temperature . The perfect portion or meat cheese potatoes etc. The rocking chairs by the tiniest bar are also a plus 
Super Burrito on 5th,121,I m a southern California native and the carne asada burritos are close not quite. Missing the carne asada  juice  that makes it authentic SoCal.
Super Burrito on 5th,122,Incredible burritos   Being from California  this place is as close as it gets to the real San Diego burrito   Solid burrito at a solid price.  Plus it s so fast  they normally hand you your burrito before you get your receipt 
Super Burrito on 5th,123,This is an awesome burrito joint   I m not usually into food trucks  but this one has great outdoor seating  amazing food  and so close to downtown  it s nice to walk off that delicious burrito at trader joes or Waterloo afterward.
Super Burrito on 5th,124,Great burritos. About as close to real taco shop Mexican food as I ve found in Austin. Blows the doors off of tex-mex anything. Worth the drive from Round Rock.
Super Burrito on 5th,125,Jolly Green Giant burrito is PERFECTION. Perfectly spiced  super healthy  and still warm when it arrived at my house. All ingredients were quality and flavorful. Highly recommend it
Super Burrito on 5th,126,I was so excited to find a  California burrito  in Austin. Super burrito misses on the  Asada  part of carne asada. The burrito itself was great except for the meat. It literally tasted like boiled meat with little flavor. I want this place to be successful  but to do so  it has to actually marinate and grill the carne asada. The meat in the San Diego burrito is nothing like like you ll find in San Diego  where you her grilled marinated steak that really makes the flavor. Please guys  make real carne asada and you ll be unstoppable 
Super Burrito on 5th,127,They got too good for Oltorfand are now located in downtown. This really removes some of the charm. I m sorry  Yes  it s the same name. But I don t think they should be feeding yuppies who know where their next meal is coming from. It s almost fitting that their current location is currently a trailer. They gave up their loyal audiences for people who had never supported this local institution. The food is good and hearty  but I am just disgusted by the move.
Super Burrito on 5th,128,Best Burrito I have ever had  Had the Jolly Green Giant Veggie Burrito. Loaded with beans  mushrooms. Great flavor  Would def come here again. Service was friendly. There is plenty of seating all outside though.
Super Burrito on 5th,129,Best calm burritto I ve ever had  Whatever they put on the chicken...I take a spoonful of that everyday. Quick and delicious. Win-Win
Super Burrito on 5th,130,I love super burrito  but the one on 5th isn t my favorite. There never seems to be enough effort put into the food. Unlike the super burrito on Cesar Chavez  this location never satisfies me. The carne asada isn t as flavorful  the fries are plain  and they even put leftover breakfast potatoes from an order before mine which really ruined the taste of my carne asada fries  and on top of all that  the only thing that was hot in my order was the breakfast potatoes. I ve never really wanted to complain for a refund at any location  until I went to this location. Overall I would recommend super burrito to any and everyone  but I wouldn t recommend this location.
Super Burrito on 5th,131,so. fucking. good. sorry I had to cuss  but it s really good  I love the atmosphere. The parking may be difficult to be found  but worth it if you eat here. Their sauce to add to burritos is really good. I want to eat here almost everyday 
Super Burrito on 5th,132,Nice place and a Super deal in Tuesday...Taco Tuesday rocks and the service is great.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,1,GreaT food- chicken and their chicken flautas and obviously their black beans are to die for as well as their green salsa  My parents love the chicken salad. I feel like you can t really go wrong with anything here. Also  the management and stuff is great. Brandon Garcia Is an incredible individual and thankful to have him at this location.l    also always love the environment  it s always very chill and an easy place to eat and hang out with friends or family and always clean   
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,2,Love me Zuzu  Best salsa bar around  I always get the Zuzu chicken salad and it s topped of with a scoop of guac. Delicious Guacamole  Their preach tea is yummy too  Wish they were still in Dallas...
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,3,Yikes  Really bad experience. Right when we entered the server automatically said  dios mio  and gasp. i know what it meant but okay. Sat down and told us that we can t just sit there we need to order. Like talk about customer service. Food was awful. Rice was old. No meat on burrito. Extra avocado was a smear of avocado btw.. lols
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,4,Let me start by saying  the employees were super nice. Our order was to go  so we realized what we got when we got home. We ordered a chimichanga  which was supposed to be fried.  There is NO way it was  no crunch at all and it was covered in what tasted like Velveeta cheese. Not too authentic. We also ordered Super Burrito  the name is deceiving because it was rather small. We called to let them know the chimi was not fried  to which the response was  it was. We ve eaten enough food in our days to know it wasn t. Although the staff was great  we re  sorry to say  wewill pass on the food 
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,5,Let me preface by saying that I LOVE ZuZu. I grew up eating in Dallas TX... when I found out there was still a location in Austin I was thrilled and I ve eaten here a HANDFUL of times since. I just wanted to say quality and customer service has gone downhill. I paid extra for a large chips salsa but was still required to purchase a large salsa at the register when I picked up my order. Maybe I ll try ordering in store next time to avoid further confusion and disappointment.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,6,Been going her since I was a child and they always hit it on the nail  Love their breakfast tacos and refried black beans  Can t wait to make this place a tradition for my kids in the future.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,7,This is a nice little restaurant hidden in the corner of a small business strip. They have well-organized ordering  with customers entering and immediately bring in line to order. Trouble is that at the register there is a bunch of  stuff  that partially hides the register.  The counter is simply crowded. They have a varied menu of standard Mexican food fare  tacos  burritos  nachos  quesadillas  fajitas  etc. Their vegetables are always very fresh and the various proteins are grilled and seasoned very well. They have fresh salsa of different intensity as well as fresh cilantro  pico  and other items to add to your meal. Currently  due to COVID precautions  they are individually packaged  and I find the servings to be more than adequate. I m a huge fan of their chicken tacos and chicken quesadillas. However  while always tasty  the quantity of chicken each time varies. Their steak tacos are really good too.  They are tasty and filling and the cheese is just right. There s nice outdoor seating that I recommend when the weather cooperates. If you re in the area  this is a good place to stop in. Odds a very good you ll be satisfied with your meal.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,8,I ve been here quite a few times in the last month and I would say that the corn tortillas are absolutely amazing  Definitely an authentic Mexican casual stop in the corn tortillas let you know that this place is special 
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,9,I would not use ZuZu for your future party or gathering.  I am a planner and don t like to leave things to the last minute so I went online  on Monday  to put in an order for 25 mixed fajita plates  for a gathering I was having on Thur.  On Thur I called  around 11am  to make sure that we were still  good to go .  I was assured that they saw my order and it would be ready around 5 45pm.  I showed up at 5 50pm to find everyone sitting around looking at their phones.  I asked if I could get my   order to-go  and they looked at me with blank faces.  My  order was not ready and no one had an idea of what I was talking about.  I showed them my confirmation on my phone and they then proceeded to call someone who might have a clue and then told me the order was never put in the system.  I was furious.  My party started at 6 30 and I wanted to get there early to setup and now I had no food and was going to be late.  The only reason I m not giving this one star is because they were able to get my order together in about 20 mins.  The food was so so but at least it was hot.  Whoever manages this establishment should consider a process change for large take-away orders.  Whoever owns Zuzu might consider hiring a new manager.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,10,This food was sloppy and not genuine. The taco was not good and looked horrible  meanwhile the fajitas were not properly cooked and were not traditionally Mexican style. I will not order this food again and will look elsewhere for authentic Mexican food.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,11,Finally stopped by for lunch and am very glad I did.  From the mixed reviews  I decided I wanted to try it myself and well - from the photos  the food looks delicious.  I am always a fan of fresh salsa bars   As I wanted to try a couple menu items  I decided to go a la carte - which I am also a big fan of.    Between myself and the hubby  we ordered   Mahi-Mahi taco   these were filled with grilled mahi-mahi  lettuce  tomatoes  and sprinkled with cotija cheese. All the ingredients were fresh and the Mahi-Mahi was superb.   Shrimp taco  this was filled with grilled shrimp  fresh pico de gallo  sliced avocado  and sprinkled with cotija cheese. They do not skimp out on the shrimp which was fairly good sized - also  very fresh and well seasoned.  One of the best Shrimp tacos I have had in Austin.  Picadillo Taco   filled with house made Picadillo taco meat. Topped with lettuce tomatoes  and mozzarella cheese. I have never had Picadillo like this before. Usually the Picadillo I have tried in the past is made with ground beef and sometimes peas and potatoes in it.  This Picadillo here was more like a stewed meat and WOW  so flavorful.  Both my husband and I were taken back with how delicious this meat was. Definitely recommended   Chips  amp  Salsa  Yes  you need to purchase the chips to go with the Salsa bar. No  this is not your typical sit down type Mexican Tex-Mex restaurant. It s more like fast food as you order at the counter so I did not mind the fact that the chips are not complimentary - except during Happy Hour.  The chips were fresh and tasty.   The Salsa Bar - OMG  so good   There are three different types of salsa. Visually  the Salsa bar was clean and inviting - as if to say  come try all of it.  I particularly favored the Verde sauce.  Another interesting addition is that they have a bottle of Crema and butter.  I am not ashamed to admit  I like butter on my chips. So between the salsas  crema  and butter - I was in total absolute heaven.  I look forward to returning to try more menu items.  Tip   Saturdays is free queso and Happy Hour free chips to go with the amazing salsa.  Let me add - customer service was good  the place was clean and the food came out hot and fast.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,12,I have even had my husband bring me takeout to Houston. Fresh great peach mango tea  fresh salsa bar an assortment of sides great food served quickly.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,13,Cashier manager had a very intimidating attitude while ordering. Not only to us but the couple before and after. Immediately ruined the first time experience there. Chips were stale  in terms of  Mexican food  this was not very good. Meat was old cold  rough on all four of our plates. Flavors were rushed and sloppy. Looks like they poured the salsa from the chips onto the enchiladas because it tasted and looked the same as the salsa and chips  Tortillas tasted stale and overall plate flavors did not satisfy my Latin roots. Not for me  wouldn t go back. On a positive note  the music playlist was good.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,14,On 8 19 2019  my colleagues and I had food catered from Zuzu.   We ordered chicken  vegetable and steak fajitas as well as beans  rice and freshly made tortillas.  I tried all the fajita mixtures  but was the most fond of the classic chicken fajitas. The fajitas had tender chicken  saut ed onions and peppers. The freshness of the vegetables and meat make these some of the best Tex-Mex fajitas in the ATX.   A must try 
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,15,This was the 1st time that I ordered here and I ordered delivery through Grub Hub.. I ordered the ZuZu salad with chicken and what I received was a box of lettuce with dry pieces of tasteless chicken. No dressing  no guacamole  no cheese  no tortilla strips. What am I supposed to do with this  So  now I will order a salad from somewhere else and try to incorporate this into that.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,16,Ordered delivery for my first try of this restaurant--pork verde chili and spinach chicken burrito. Both quite tasty but very little pork in the chili  mostly liquid  and the accompanying tortillas were not wheat as I ordered.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,17,This place used to be decent but the quality has sank and prices have risen. I guess they stay in business due to limited choices in that area. Bummer 
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,18,Delicious roasted chicken--on par with  better than Fresas and way cheaper. Wonderful staff and always friendly. Highly recommend this casual neighborhood Austin original.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,19,Every time I am in north Austin I decide to return to eat here and I do. Located off of MoPac you have to maneuver to get here.  The place is designed to order and food is brought to you.  I ordered the Migas Platter and coffee.    We met the owner before and quickly chatted with him.  Coffee was out and someone quickly started to make a new pot.  This place is much different from your standard Tex mex restaurant and always enjoyed the food here.  Soon the coffee was ready and our meals. The Migas was very good and tasted excellent.  The plate cans with tortillas  roasted potatoes and slice of watermelon.   I look forward in returning back for another great meal.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,20,Very good service. Everyone was sooo sweet and the food was athletic    It was delicious
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,21,Just spent 12 minutes waiting for a way to salty  burnt bacon and a teaspoon of chorizo breakfast taco for  3.49.  So salty I  had to threw most of it away .  I eat there a lot  but after today will be finding another place.  Customers in the store should not wait for food for the afternoon to be cooked      
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,22,Their chimichanga with chicken and shrimp tacos are my go-tos. Get the beans as one of your sides 
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,23,My wife and I have picked up food a couple times during the pandemic and the service has been exceptional both times. We were even given a free large order of homemade tortilla chips which are amazing. The shrimp tacos seem to get tastier each time we order them. This past visit I finally ordered the Zuzu Sundae which was phenomenal.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,24,I don t come here often but every time I do the quelite of the food is good. Staff is friendly. I liked the fish platter and my 54 cents homemade tortillas. Wish they had compostable to go containers.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,25,First time ordering from here and half of my order was left off including the salsa for the chips and salsa that I ordered.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,26,First time eating this restaurant s food. Ordered for delivery with door dash. If this is real Mexican food  then I am not Mexican American. The  cheese enchiladas in red sauce were cotija cheese wrapped in flour tortillas  slightly grilled and covered in what tasted like a pizza or marinara sauce. Definitely not real Mexican food. The charro beans were served in a small corn tortilla  bowl  but were dry. The roasted potatoes were okay. My husband had the mahi mahi tacos and he said they were  alright . Won t order from this place anymore.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,27,I always enjoy coming here  It s a wonderful place if you are looking for good  clean  homemade Mexican food. Great salsa bar  high quality food  and for a great price  Casual and fast. A great  local spot 
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,28,We were a group of 5 and tried a few dishes. Taco salad with grilled veggies amd grilled fish  avacado Tacos  veffies salad with grilled onions  chimichamga platter with chicken amd roast chicken plate.  Food was very tasty and fresh.  Upon ordering and paying  we took our seat and food came to our table.  Good customer service amidst busy lunch service. They have a table of sides which had dauces and salsa and jalapenos amd lime. It was very very good.  Overall a good lunxh experience.  Fast  tasy and yummy mexicam food
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,29,It s OK. We had a quesadilla and burrito  and it was fine. I wouldn t go back  because I d rather try something else.   The lady taking orders was nice and it looked like service was good too 
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,30,My food delivery is extremely late. I called the restaurant  and when I asked when my order is goin to arrive because it s late  the guy who answered said   I don t know. Your driver isn t there yet   and hung up.  It was supposed to arrive by 11 09  and it s 11 27. I m hangry  assholes.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,31,Good food  good value   staff is great  I appreciate how they are handling the current situation.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,32,I typically am a fan of the food here  but this morning was clearly an exception. I ordered something simple  some breakfast tacos to go. When they brought me my tacos we went over the list and all seemed good. When I got home one of the tacos  a steak  egg  and cheese  turned out to be chorizo  egg  and cheese. And the chorizo soooooo greasy that no one could handle the taco without getting their entire hands covered with grease. So disgusting. Come on ZuZu it s not that early in the morning.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,33,This has always been one of my favorite places to eat. The spinach chicken burrito on wheat was my go-to  but now I m stuck on the verde chicken enchiladas with the corn tortillas. Always fresh  great sauces and the fact that it s healthy is a major bonus.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,34,Picked up food from take out this evening and we ve been eating at this restaurant for 13 years.  Fabulous as always 
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,35,Great fresh food here. Excellent fajitas  breakfast  fresh vegetables and incredible guacamole.  All the sauces are homemade and super fresh.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,36,I have been holding on writing a review due to laziness.  I have been here over 10 times and service always seems to be lackluster.  One of the gentlemen there is always very short and seems to hate working there.  Other than that  the food is decent.  While it s not the most flavorful food I have tasted  I do appreciate the quality of the food.  You can tell it s made with care and they do not overload their food options with cheese like most typical  Mexican  restaurants.   I do not feel  guilty  for eating here because I feel like this is not junk food  depending on what you get .  If you get their chicken corn tacos  then this makes for a good healthy take out option.  Kudos to Zuzu s for that.  With that being said  the gentlemen needs be more patient and not hurry you up over the phone or in person.  I recommend only if you are in a rush and want quick mexican food that s not that flavorful.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,37,In town for the holidays and I decided I would visit since I frequently ate here for lunch during my Austin days. I always order the Verde soup and it s always good...today I encountered a rubber-ban. I chewed on it for a minute thinking the pork was a little tough. I mentioned it to the lady cleaning the tables she then went to tell everyone...everyone just looked at me. The manager did not come check on my at all. It seems as if this restaurant has gone down hill. Will not return here. Check your food if you can.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,38,My boyfriend and i just moved to this area and we were looking for a place that was locally owned. Zuzu was 3 minutes from our place and since it was so close we were excited to try it and have a new spot for mexican when we had cravings. This place is byob which is awesome  I had the taco salad with steak and my boyfriend had a spinach salad with chicken. Everything was so fresh and definitely will be a new spot we plan to go 
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,39,I came here hungry and ready to  really enjoy some Mexican food  but everything here really was just okay. I had two steak enchiladas and a chicken Gordita with a side of charro beans. The beans were the only thing that lived up to what you d expect from a good mexican restaurant.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,40,I give a solid 3 stars. I ve been many times and though consistency varies it s always  except once  between good and really good. I ve never had a problem with the service or the wait time. The room is spacious with plenty of light. It reminds me of a cafeteria. There is outdoor seating which is quite pleasant if you can ignore the proximity to mopac and the parking lot. I like the choice of sides and the salsa bar. Neither are  knock-outs  but consistent.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,41,Well  I finally had a unpleasant visit to Zuzu s. The food was still great  but the service fell apart today. I waited behind a guy who had gotten an incorrect order. He was fine with it  the server was not. She was upset at him and decided to take it out on me. She was rude  angry  and just wanted me to go away. My order was wrong and I was missing two items  one taco  one Coke . I was not in the mood to go back in and face her again so I just drove away and ate what I got. The owners of Zuzu are wonderful people who usually do what it takes to get things right the first time. Maybe they were not there  it was a Sunday  or maybe they just have to take what they can get in this labor market. This was my first disappointing visit to what is usually a five star joint. It happens. Don t let this keep you from visiting here if you are from somewhere else. This place is still the best non-Tex-Mex in Austin 
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,42,We had Zuzu delivered via an app. We got nachos and a fajita. Both were the worst we have ever had. The  nachos  were chips with melted shredded white cheese and diced tomatoes. The cheese covered about 7 chips  leaving the majority as literally just chips.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,43,Zuzu  I worship you Mexican God of   Gigantic menu   Fresh  colorful  handmade delicous Tex-Mex  Huge and inexpensive portions  Extraordinary service  Fun decor and vibe  Salsa onion bar  I am healed and converted to only pray to you  Zuzu when Tex-mex spirits crave me south of the border.  There are so many options here and you can even eat healthy with salads  lettuce tacos  fish  fat-free refried beans.  Let me elaborate on the lettuce tacos....huge dark green lettuce filled with grilled chicken  ground beef  steak  etc and topped with your choice of tomatoes  fresh white cheese  onions  guac  sour cream  salsa.  Grilled chicken was tasty juicy and ground beef was seasoned up all brown and perfect.  Gorditas  enchiladas  flautas  nachos  burritos  etc etc all dancing around the menu like tasty little heathens.    Service is top notch and dealt with my slow ordering and annoying questions like only professionals could.  When I get starved I tend to stare at menus like an alien who has never seen food before.   Regret not finding this Mexican idol sooner.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,44,We go to ZuZus from time to time.  This isn t a true Mexican or Tex-Mex spot but it is good.  Friendly service  affordable food  and tastes good.  It has not always been consistently flavorful food  even with the same dish  for me to rate it higher.  Definitely worth trying if you live in the area and don t want to go far.  They have outside seating as well.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,45,Our first time trying ZuZu and it was disappointing. The food was cold  the chicken tough  the fajitas skimpy and the mole sauce just didn t taste like mole.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,46,Totally fine place to eat. It s a nice sized restaurant you walk right up to the counter to order and they ll give you a number hanger and come deliver your food when it s ready  like whataburger . They only have bottled beer and wine for alcoholic beverages. I ordered the blackened catfish taco and the pulled pork taco. They were fine. Nothing exciting at all. Quick service which makes it easy for lunch. Affordable prices. Just average
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,47,Ambience - very beautiful and colorful store. Everything looks handpainted and there is lots of bright colors. There is lots of natural lighting since 2 of the walls are windows. The vibe here was really cool and felt cozy. There is plenty of seating and a nice salsa bar at the beverage station. When I got there there was a bunch of boxes everywhere but I guess it was truck day so they got all their supplies. Overall I really enjoyed the way the dining room looked  it felt like a little piece of Latin America   Menu - their claim to fame is everything is homemade  so I m guessing it is a scratch kitchen for Mexican food. The menu sports both traditional Mexican food items as well as a breakfast menu. The menu is pretty varied and offers lots of options and choices. It hits the main staples of enchiladas  burritos  taco salads and entree meals. Some of the items on the menu are unique and they blend different cusisnes into traditional dishes. So there is some specialty dishes you won t find elsewhere. Overall the menu is pretty standard of what you would find at any Mexican food place but with some unique twists. Solid menu with plenty of options.   Service - as I came in there was gentleman unpacking supplies right in front of the register. He was clearly the manager and I m pretty sure he was the General Manager by the way he interacted with guests and crew. Anyways he seemed like a really nice guy. The teenager at the register seemed very nervous  so I m pretty sure he is new. It took him awhile to figure out how to run my card. But that s ok  everyone is new at some point. He was friendly and nice  he followed the routine of asking if I want this or that  but it was definitely scripted and it didnt flow naturally. There was 2 older Hispanic  ladies in the kitchen who said hello to me and gave me a warm smile. Bonus points for that. While i was eating a guest came in that apparently comes here all the time as all the staff got super excited to see this man. Always a good sign when you see repeat guests and guests that the kitchen know. This gentleman and the GM also apparently know alot about each other as they talked for a long while about business and life. So why is this important and in my review  Because that s excellent service there  if you have guests that you know on a personal basis then that probably means you are doing something great when it comes to food and service. So overall the service was very nice and very welcoming. It was like a family vibe going.   Food - so I got the Mexi-cajun monster burrito. I think that was the name  but it was a monster chicken burrito with cajun style sauce. I also got 2 sides  one was Mexican rice and then a corn salsa salad thing. The sides were good  nothing super special. The rice was a pretty standard Mexican rice that you find anywhere. The corn salsa was nice  had a nice sweet taste of the corn. I mixed them both together and they tasted really nice together. They were good but nothing to cream your pantied over. The burrito was a large burrito filled with all the wonderful veggies and chicken. They cut it at bias for you and it looked beautiful. The burrito was really good. The veggies were nice and fresh and had a great flavor. The chicken was still moist and had a great spicy kick. It wasnt like super spicy but it did pack a nice heat. It almost tasted like a buffalo sauce to be honest. But either way it was good. The mixture of all these things lead to a really great tasting burrito. Nothing overpowered anything and they all complimented each other well. This is one of the better monster burritos I have had anywhere. It was packed full and didnt skimp of anything. I really enjoyed how the chicken wasnt dry and how simple yet flavorful this was. Some places focus too much on a robust sauce or something that overpowers all the veggies and beans  so that basically all you taste is sauce. So overall my meal was really good. The burrito had a great flavor that was fresh and spicy.   Overall - gotta say that this was pretty good stop for me. The service was good  the food was tasty and the price was reasonable. Never been to a scratch Mexican food joint but I wasnt disappointed. I really love the decor of the store and the fact that the crew was just so unique and genuine with guests. It also gives props that they have regulars that everyone knows and loves. I drive by this place every day to work and noticed the bright purple and yellow letters but could never tell what it was because there are trees that block the view from the highway. But yeah  really great place with a solid menu and good food
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,48,This place has THE best tasting food   Their tortilla soup  roasted potatoes  salad dressing  and peach tea are unique and the best anywhere.  Their blacken catfish platter and cilantro Chile chicken are both outstanding   Their BBQ catfish tacos and gorditos are also really good especially when you add the fresh cilantro  onion  and a little of their homemade salad dressing.   If you order online  be sure to check your order to be sure everything is correct as you would with any take out order.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,49,I have been a customer for 3 years and sometimes they get my order correct and sometimes they don t. Today  they didn t get my order correct and all they could do was refund me since I don t feel safe going into restaurants right now. They did refund me which makes me happy. They need to do a much better job of checking the orders and making sure they are correct  especially when the orders are being delivered. I did e-mail them and complain and it is going to be quite a while before I order from them again. I will say their queso is delish  They have issues getting my tacos correct even though I have made very clear notes on Grubhub and even when I have dined in  they have not made my tacos correctly. If you do order from them  especially on Grubhub  and you have special requests  make it extremely clear  amp  maybe even call them and make it clear so your order is correct. If I do ever order from them again  that is what I will so so my order will be correct 
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,50,Fantastic food and service  plus you can BYOB  They also have their own modest selection of beer. This place consistently delivers a quality dining experience.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,51,Talk about dissapointing.  I wanted breakfast my wife wanted lunch.  We get there at 1 55 wait in line get to the front of the line.  Get to front of line at 2 02 ask to order breakfast and told that it is after 2.  We say have been in line since before 2  and told it is already put away.  Part of the reason was at front of line after 2 was only person ringing up orders went to the back to talk to someone for a few minutes  I order chicken enchiladas with queso sauce  wife orders a salad.  My enchiladas came out room temp to cold.  Sent them back as wanted hot food.  Came out at room temp again.  Besides putting some more queso on top hard to see what they did.  Second time in a row for bad food. Previous time Chicken was so dry as to be inedible.  It is convenient as across the street from my office  but looks like I am going elsewhere
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,52,The quality of their ingredients is top-notch including the meats and vegetables. I love that one of their side choices is grilled vegetables. The staff is quite friendly. Their selection of salsas is amazing  and because they re all so delicious  it s hard to choose .... so I just get some of each. If you go onto their website  there s a link to order online and pickup.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,53,Tasty  not expensive at all and friendly as can be. Gluten-free friendly  celiac friendly  kids friendly and vegan friendly.  Our family consists of one vegan  one vegeterian  and one child with Celiac disease  so you see it could be a challenge for us to find in a restaurant something for everyone. So Zuzu is absolutely great for us.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,54,Quick.  Cheap. Reliable.  Not to heavy.  Always fresh.  Love the salads  amazing vinegrette  and the roast chicken is always good.  Tasty tacos but nothing super special.  Good refried beans.  Beans and salad are best side options.  Not where I d go for enchiladas.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,55,This is one of my favorite locally owned Mexican restaurants. Food is interior Mexican  so a nice change from Tex-Mex. The grilled steak and chicken tacos are super delicious. They have great Veggie flautas  and most of their sides are vegetarian. Be sure to try the black refried beans and ancho chile new potatoes.Service is always excellent  and the food is super fresh. The grilled shrimp tacos are one of my favorites. So flavorful  and better than most costing a lot more. They have a salsa bar with 3 different salsas and house-made picco de Gallo. Queso is excellent also. Peach mango tea is an added bonus. They serve beer and wine  but you can also bring  your own. Give Zuzu s a try. You won t be disappointed 
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,56,Quite often I find myself inviting guests to my home last minute with no thought of what I will serve    I do not panic because I have the best authentic from scratch restaurant in my neighborhood      ZuZu never lets me down   The mixed fajitas   Mexican style rice and black beans  fresh hand made tortillas   chips that you wish you could buy last minute at the supermarket and the salsas  from poblano   to pico de gallo  to red salsa all made from scratch       So reasonably priced   Such large portions prepared family style for a crowd if you ask    So fresh   A kind and welcoming staff  clearly talented chef and assistants ... and an accessible owner who actually cares about his customers   Sometimes you may get one  even two of the above but consistently I get all three    I love this restaurant    
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,57,Regret stopping in to try this place. Let s start with their Peach. Mango tea bland  bland  threw it out settled for surgery soda. Mahi taco platter  the mahi is cut into bit size pieces  also bland and overcooked  drowned it with lemon juice and salsa to eat it. Couldn t finish the as second one. My sides were their grilled vegi 90  purple onion  5  red pepper and 5  poblano. Not really vegi huh  And the potatoes were probably the best thing on the plate  but dont ask me why   ....now my stomach is grumbling
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,58,I ordered migas for breakfast today. The flavor was good however this is the soggiest migas I have ever had  the menu said Corn chips. I am giving them 3 stars because the salsa bar is good and they gave me homemade corn tortillas. Also the potatoes were just eh. Very friendly staff and very clean over all.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,59,I ve been coming here for years. Their food is very fresh. I really enjoy the grilled chicken salad. It s light  amp  fresh.   They have awesome guacamole. And their salsa bar is a nice touch. I m sure all the salsas are house made.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,60,This place is amazing like no other great hand made food very professional stuff I love this place
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,61,Good prices  good food made to order. Clean and neat. fresh salsas. They actually have decaf tea and Coke
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,62,Good had no flavor. I added plenty salsa and cilantro . It didn t fill me up either. My food got to my table before I even sat down. I was getting my soda and salsa and the lady said here s your food. Less than 2 mins after I ordered.   2nd time here food was good service was good 
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,63,This Tex-Mex restaurant is one of my favorite quick  amp  healthy lunch or dinner spots.  It s quick  but it s not fast food.    Their menu has all the standard fare you d expect  fajitas  enchiladas  tacos  quesadillas  etc.  The food is fresh  colorful  and well presented  eliminating that unhealthy  hues of brown and gold  effect that you often get with a Mexican food plate.  This restaurant offers sides like a green salad  made with real leafy greens  not shredded iceberg lettuce   grilled corn relish  and blended black beans served in a taco shell cup  my kids  favorite .  The fajitas include red and green bell peppers.  The fish tacos  my favorite  are made with mahi mahi and served with green leaf lettuce. There is a specials board with various selections that change weekly.  They have a standard kids  menu for 12  amp  under.  Salsas are handmade and are available on ice at a side bar.  They offer pico de gallo  diced red onions  and a delicious verde  amp  chunky red salsa.  For drinks  they offer bottled beer and Jarritos sodas from a cooler on the front counter  along with iced tea and sodas and lemonade.  Here s what makes it quick  You view the menu and order the food at the front counter  pay and get a plastic number tent.  Then you pick up your drinks  amp  silverware and choose a table.  They bring your food to you when it s ready  usually 10-15 minutes max .  The dining area is one large room with mainly 2  amp  4 top tables  with a few available for larger party seating  we ve also shoved a few tables together for larger parties on occasion .  They bus the tables when you leave.  All in all  a pleasant dining experience.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,64,Love the food But need to have two registers going when busy. Or a separate line just for pickups. Food still is very good.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,65,Walked in  ordered breakfast bowl  was only customer. They forgot it. Will not go back  amazing
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,66,It was  25 for 2 bowls  one chicken  one veggie  plus chips and guacamole. That is way expensive compared to similar places like Chipotle.   The bowls lacked much flavor and had very odd amounts of items like tons of lettuce and barely any rice. Nothing was seasoned well or very tasty. Also the black beans were refried for some unknown reason which turned the bowl into a big black bean bowl of mush.   No  just no.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,67,Dry chicken  grease puddles and just not good. Thought it would be better. Disappointed.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,68,Interesting take on the enchilada plate. Delicious green sauce  shredded beef instead of chopped and black beans are substituted for refried.   Creative interior Mexico cuisine with attentive  friendly service and fair prices.  You can t go wrong by dining here 
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,69,Summed up as bland and overpriced  very let down. Polite staff and clean establishment.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,70,The restaurant has a very nice decor on the inside the food was not bad and the service was very good  we got the pork taco special it was very good  and the beans  was good  it is served in a  corn cup shell
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,71,I will be honest  the only item I have had from their menu is their zuzu salad with shrimp. However  the salad alone warrants 4 stars. It consists of deliciously seasoned grilled shrimp on a bed of shredded romaine lettuce with a little bit of guac tortilla strips  and what I THINK is a sprinkling of cotija cheese. The dressing is a rosemary-lime vinaigrette with what I think is minced garlic. I wish they bottled that up and sold it because I would put that      on everything  It s THAT good   My friend had the avocado tacos on flour tortillas and he seemed to really enjoy them. There s also a salsa bar which is always a plus. I like adding a little of their red salsa and pickled jalapenos to my salad for extra spice and flavor.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,72,I am a fan of Zuzu s because of the food. Atmosphere is one step above a fast food place  so I wouldn t come here on an evening that I wanted to dine out  but I have come here a number of times for lunch  take-out  and during the week in the evenings when I want something quick and good. The food is tasty  and they have an extensive menu. This week I got the green chile chicken  and it came with two sides--the salad and grilled veggies were great. It s seldom that I leave a Mexican food restaurant feeling healthy  but I do when I eat here  because they have some healthy choices.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,73,While this was not one of the worst Mexican restaurants in Austin  it was one of the most mediocre. The food was incredibly bland. I  had the steak taco platter with black beans  salty  and  Mexican  rice. Ugh  no  that rice was NOT Mexican or Spanish rice. It was minute rice fluffed with some spices added for color with some peas and corn kernels tossed in for good measure. The steak was dry and flavorless. Nothing memorable about the food.  I was surprised that there were lots of people lunching there  but then I remembered the rule about ethnic restaurants  you can gauge the authenticity of an  ethnic  restaurant by the amount of similarly  ethnic  customers dining there. I was the ONLY Hispanic in there. My husband pointed out that there was a lady sitting behind us  but she was clearly an employee.   On the up side  I liked the salsa bar and the lettuce they used for the tacos was romaine so it was nice and crunchy. If y all want pointers on how to spice up your salsa bar  check out the salsa bar at Taco Palenque in Laredo  TX. The Taco Palenque salad bar is nothing short of spectacular.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,74,This is a great little fast casual place. The food was fresh and tasty  the service was fast  there was a nice selection of salsas and we enjoyed all of it. Great value too 
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,75,The menus and website prices need to be updated   I certainly didn t appreciate being surprised at the cash register with higher than listed prices.  When I asked the cashier about it he responded with confusion    Oh  I think they changed the prices  miss.   Really  dude   If prices were off by just a few cents I wouldn t be complaining  but this was a couple of dollars - that is frustrating.  He also didn t offer to do anything because of their error.  And while I think they re onto something with their breakfast bowls  they were actually pretty tasty through pretty greasy  I m gonna hold off on visiting again until they get it together.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,76,One of my go to places for Mexican food. Is this really authentic Mexican food  nope. Is it delicious and well done   Yes  High quality ingredients and the best part is they are not afraid to flavor their food   The salsa is some of the best of ever had as well  Great place   Try the Tuesday special 
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,77,The Burrito Bowl is to experience your taste buds exploding with fresh  natural flavors. Downsizing is not the game plan here. It s all about flavor and experience.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,78,This is a filthy restaurant  and unsurprisingly  disgusting and disappointing food. It baffles me how they stay in business.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,79,Was not disappointed  a bit small but great customer service and almost no wait  Food came out fast and fresh  Will for sure come again soon.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,80,A hidden Austin gem   It is yummy  affordable  fast and super fresh      They have a bar of salsa  fresh jalape os  fresh onions  fresh cilantro  and limes. Highly recommend the tostados  but everything is good    Also the employees are noticeably kind to you and also to each other  
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,81,Born and raised in Mexico City and the daughter and granddaughter of two of the finest cooks  I m spoiled and have high expectations. That said  there are so many places to eat excellent Mexican food in Austin - both Interior and TexMex - that there is no reason to spend one dime or one minute anywhere mediocre. Zuzu is mediocre in every since of the word. Sorry Zuzu.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,82,This place is  in a word  amazing. I got the steak tacos and the carne asada so on point. All the ingredients were fresh  the veggies crispy. I got the pur ed black beans as a side. They were a little soupy for my taste  but then again  I ve never had pur ed beans before. So it s probably normal. Regardless  they were delicious.   The rice was so-so  but that could be attributed to the taco and beans out shining the rice. Also  the salsa was impressive.  The prices were entirely reasonable for a fresh  delicious meal.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,83,Skip the queso...sadly it s the most bland and runny queso I ve ever eaten.  Luckily I got take out  so I added habanero and other spices to it when I realized what a struggle it was going to be to finish it all.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,84,To start with all the tables were dirty. I wiped down my own. I regretted leaving something in the tip jar as no one could muster a thank you. My meal came after too long. One of my two sides was beans. They gave me about 2 tablespoons of beans. I left hungry. No one every wiped down any of the tables while I was there. It is clear they just don t care.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,85,I went there in 2000  amp  had a problem with my large called-in to go order.  I was shorted my 3 side orders of chips  amp  salsa. When I got back to my office with order we saw that the chips  amp  salsa orders were not in the bags. When I called to inquire about the missing chips salsa  they gave my call to a Manager who boasted he was also the owner.    When I told him my chips  amp  salsa orders were missing  he laughed and said of course they are.  Unless you picked up your salsa at our salsa bar  you won t have any.  Our customers pick their own sauce from our salsa bar.    Being it was my first   amp  last  visit to Zuzu s I wasn t aware of their procedure.  I went back to Zuzu to pick up the salsa  since it was for 3 of my co-workers who ordered with me  the owner basically said it was my own fault I had to come back.  That I should have seen the salsa bar.  Needless to say it s 2012  I m still standing by my word to NEVER spend   where the owner of all people doesn t care about the customers.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,86,We ve eaten here many times through the years  at least since 2008  I think   and we just ate there last weekend.  And we get one thing   the Spinach Chicken Burrito.    It was just a special when we first went  but was added to the regular menu shortly afterward.  We don t order anything else anymore  every other time we ve chosen something else  we ve been very disappointed and didn t like the food.  Sometimes even the spinach chicken burrito can have too much or too little chicken or the chicken is too dry or the vinaigrette is too little or the burrito tortilla is too dry and starts cracking and falling apart.  Fortunately  despite that long list of potential flaws  it s usually very good  which is why we keep going back.  Oh  and the green salsa in the salsa bar  it s fantastic and a great complement to the burrito.  The frequent diner program is weird  it doesn t matter what you buy.  It s 1-use  to get a stamp or use a full card  per whole-party.  It just feels unfriendly and rubs us the wrong way  though we eat there often enough that we do use it.  We have young kids now and have tried the children s menu quesadilla several times  but it s too-dry more often than not  and if not eaten quickly it become hard.   Our children are too young to understand they should just eat-it-up right away if they like it.   We do enjoy the chips and queso  especially the free  happy hour  chips and small queso on Saturdays.   Chips by themselves do cost  unlike a number of restaurants.   The men s bathroom does not have an infant changing table  there is plenty of room for one   which has been a 4  year frustration for me as a dad that often changes the kids  diapers.  Shall I put the baby down on the concrete bathroom floor for a change   The seat belts on the high chairs are usually broken.  On our last visit  I checked every one  every single one was broken.  Be careful when the floors  especially the bathroom floors  are recently washed.  They become very slippery 
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,87,I m a big fan of Zuzu s for 5 specific reasons  1. Close proximity to home - perfect for take-out 2. The homemade corn tortillas are absolutely perfect 3. The chicken flautas are the best I ve ever had  and believe me I ve had my share. 4. The chicken spinach salad with their house dressing is my very favorite salad.  5. Last  but certainly not least  is the fresh salsa bar that has pico de gallo  3 salsas  fresh and pickled jalape os  limes  cilantro  onions and sour cream.   The menu has a variety of appetizers  combo meals  and Zuzu s specials. Please take note  this is not a Tex-Mex establishment.   In my opinion many of the visitors who ve written negative reviews could have improved their culinary experience by utilizing the flavorful treats on the salsa bar.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,88,I m updating because I decided to give Zuzus another chance. My steak tacos this time were 100  better than my last few visits. The flour tortillas were soft and tasted fresh and there was a generous portion of juicy  flavorful steak. I hope this wasn t a fluke  and if they have indeed stepped up their game  they have regained a former loyal customer.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,89,It s a-ok place. The salsa bar was  a little disappointing.  We ordered Flautas and a chimichanga. The oil had a little off flavor. I think it went a bit rancid. Nothing to write home about.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,90,First time eating here and last.  I ordered the steak tacos.  The meat was tough  the seasoning was not good at all and the flour tortillas were cold.  High prices low quality food.  Not worth the stop.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,91,I ordered a tostada  taco and a thing I never heard of before.  It was a small corn bottom with beans and all kinds of things on it.  I ate every bite of the entire plate and enjoyed all of it. The ingredients were high quality.  No iceberg cheapie lettuce here.  There was a scoop of guacamole on my plate that was delicious.  And the salsa  I will stop there anytime I am in the area whether hungry or not.  Sorry to Torchy s but Zuzu is now my favorite casual Mexican place.  I forgot to mention how affordable it is.  Crazy good food for little bitty bit of money.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,92,The service is fantastic  Super friendly  very personable. The gentleman behind the counter was happy to take my order  and it made me happy to give it. It was an atmosphere that a person can really feel warm and welcome. It reminded me of going to a dear friend s house for Thanksgiving.   The food however  is very confusing.   The food is made with some care and thoughtfulness. I believe it was made with freshness being a priority. Very respectable but  lacking.   There was nothing in terms of flavor. Bland. Real bland. Perhaps that s what they are going for  Given that it s nestled in perhaps the blandest part of Austin  Even the 1.25  I spent for the always reliable Hatch chillies didn t help... Much.   Fine. Another white-bread Mexican place in a strip. Who cares  There s a million of those.   Here s my real problem... Mozzarella.   Mozzarella cheese is the cheese they chose to be their cheese of choice in all their choices.   Really  Mozzarella does not have the arm strength to hold up quesadillas  and enchiladas and every other Mexicanish dish that we all love. It s too lean  Not enough grasa  Not enough salt    Everytime I took a bite of my enchiladas it reminded me that I wished I was eating pizza. Or enchiladas. This is an uncanny valley of cuisine that really misses. I get the awful feeling that this restaurant is trying to outsmart everyone. Why  Have people ever complained about the cheese in enchiladas    But  I m rooting for you.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,93,Abysmal. Bad Mahi Mahi gave my girlfriend food poisoning  Scombroid - see  hard time breathing  huge red rash all over upper body  bloodshot eyes  increased heart beat  dizziness  burning sensation of the mouth and throat  All the food we had was reheated and not fresh.  You could tell the chicken and the fish were both reheated or left out for God knows how long   6  guacamole and chips was one ice cream scope worth of guac. A trip to urgent care ended up making this the cost of a trip to Uchi.   120   The coupon they gave us to get one entr e free with the purchase of another should ve been a glaring red flag to the state of how the restaurant is doing. Shame on Russell  the owner for allowing such practices to go on. It should be noted the staff was courteous and prompt  but regardless avoid like the plague.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,94,I was very dismayed to learn that only cash tips go to the workers at Zuzus. This is not right and there needs to be a sign           This is customary at any other place.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,95,This place was a bit strange  but really good. They have traditional tex-mex entrees  but also much less traditional sides and some less traditional entrees.  I had the blackened catfish tacos which are a personal favorite of mine whereever I go and they did not disappoint. In fact  the blackened crust was more flavorful and spicy than usual. I got the corn relish and roasted potatoes on the recommendation of friends who had been there before and both were phenomenal. The corn relish was heavily garliced--read  tasty--and just all around good. The roasted potatoes were little red potatoes cut in half and actually roasted with some slightly charred patches on them.  The inside of the place has a very fast food feel to the seating area complete with soda fountain  but they also have an outdoor deck which has a much more relaxed feel.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,96,I love this place for lunch.  The spinach chicken salad is my favorite. I also like their iced tea.  Service is always fast and the restaurant itself is always clean.  Great place for a fast yummy lunch 
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,97,I ve been going to this place for years. It s delicious  plus there s lots of lettuce on everything. What s not to like   Gorditas are pretty kick-ass  and the black beans  and the steak salad.  They also get your order out super fast  and if you type in your phone number into the rewards thingy you get like constant free queso constantly
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,98,This place is so close to my work and I just discovered it today. I m glad I did. The food is good and fast  And I like all the configurability they offer.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,99,Zuzu has fantastic picadillo  however it s a roll of the dice whether your taco shells will be fresh and crispy  or old and stale.  When they re good though they re spectacular.  If you have dairy issues be careful about eating here.  They re able to customize and not put cheese on things  but it seems like their food prep area has a lot of cross contamination.  If I order something with lettuce and tomatoes on it  I ll see bit of queso freso unintentionally mixed in.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,100,Really good standard fare. The sauce bar has some good options  nothing too fancy. Quick service. The prices are fair due to the large quantity of food you get with your order. I had the chimichanga and would definitely recommend.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,101,Omg I totally love this place... Been coming here for years ... The food is fast... Not fast food ... Everything is fresh made... And delicious.  The staff are all very friendly the decor is bright and cheerful. They have a nice area out side you can sit and eat if your  are so inclined...A highlight is the fresh salsa bar... They have several verities but the one we like the best is the tomato based chunky salsa... I could eat this as Gazpacho  If they would let me take home the extra at the end of the night I would totally come back in with a bucket    Great place for all ages...
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,102,Food is somewhat bland. Tortillas chips were stale  crispy  but oil was a little rancid .  Small portions.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,103,Just popped in to grab a couple tacos after playing at the park  meat tasted off.  18 for two tacos  side of beans  flour tortillas and small queso. I don t know  I ve been here a couple of times and it s just not that great. Sorry. Owners seem really nice  place is always neat and clean  got to give them that much. They appear to have a lot of regulars I guess I m just not going to be one of them. Maybe it was just one of those experiences that isn t typical for a place.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,104,I come here often  their burritos are amazing  I suggest the mexi jun burrito so good 
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,105,Usually  I enjoy Zuzu s especially the verde salsa which is always fresh. Tonight however the service was mediocre and so was the food. I ordered the cheese quesadilla platter for the first time and was extremely disappointed. My meal came with only one small corn tortilla cheese quesadilla which was bland. The black bean side I ordered was a smaller portion than usual. Normally  the portions are properly sized. It felt like I got a kid s meal instead of the normal platter. As for the service  when my food same out I had to send it back because I was given a chicken quesadilla instead of the cheese which I ordered. The woman was unapologetic and seemed disinterested. If you go do not order the quesadilla unless you are ordering it for a child  or aren t very hungry.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,106,I ve been going to Zuzu for about as long as it has been open and it has always been consistently awesome.  I love the spinach chicken salad  as well as all the tacos  and the breakfast tacos.  Zuzu is also allergy friendly   My son has FPIES  so even trace amounts of soy and dairy can put him in the hospital  and this is one of the only restaurants in Austin where he has never had any issue.  They re famous for their black beans  which make a great side  and are also good to add to the avocado tacos.  This is definitely one of the best Mexican places in Austin across the board.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,107,I was pretty disappointed with this place. I saw  handmade  in the name and got excited and thought I d finally try it.   My boyfriend ordered the nachos to start. The plain nachos had chips  refried black beans  a little bit of cheese on them  served with a super small dollop of guacamole on top. No jalape os  salsa  cilantro  sour cream or anything else to make them exciting. The chips were soggy and overall a disappointing experience.  I ordered a burrito bowl with corn relish  black beans and veggies. The corn relish was pretty good but the chicken looked and tasted fake and the seasoning was a bit overwhelming.   My boyfriend ordered the cilantro chile chicken which actually wasn t bad. I think that s because you could douse anything with cilantro and it d be delicious.   Overall not very impressed. Other reviews said the breakfast tacos are the way to go. If I d go back  I d go back to try these.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,108,This place has very good food and the WORST upfront cashier I have ever encountered..Horrible attitude and must hate his job..Has never gotten our simple order correct... Owners live in our neighborhood and I am shocked that they put up with this person...Tonight will be our last time there and you can know that I plan to tell everyone that asks me this simple statement-great fresh food and a horrible order taker.....
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,109,I have had chicken tostadas and chicken tacos for lunch. My friend has had fish tacos  fajita tacos and chimi. Personally I like it. It s always hot  fresh and plenty. He s not impressed with it but always eats here when on this side of town.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,110,I like the atmosphere more than I like the food. Everything is OK  but not great. The chicken enchiladas are usually good  but the food quality could be higher. The salsa bar is nice. If you are looking for a quiet spot for happy hour to sit outside that won t be full  this is a pretty good choice.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,111,Today was the first time I have eaten here in 15 years. I had the Cilantro Lime Chicken with grilled veggies and pureed black beans. My chicken was very tender  the cilantro sauce on the top very tasty. The grilled veggies just right. I have always been a fan and particularly like their fresh salsa bar. Not Texmex  but good food with sophisticated Mexican flavors.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,112,The food is simply put  average  nothing impressive. You had better like fish though  everything I order had a slight fish taste even though I did not order fish. Cleaning the grill regularly during the day would greatly improve the food. If your looking for a great dining experience I would not recommend this restaurant. If you are just wanting to eat and get going this place would work fine for you.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,113,If I could give this place 0 stars I would. The food is tasteless  service is horrible  and definitely not worth the price. I went in for lunch with my husband and daughter today and do not plan on returning. My daughters food was made correctly  however ours was not. I ordered chicken gorditas and received steak ones instead. Which is a simply small mistake no big deal. Once getting my correct gorditas they only had TWO small pieces of chicken on them and a mountain of lettuce. TWO  I repeat TWO  granted I m not expecting a lot of chicken to begin with but definitely more than two. My husband ordered a steak QUESAdilla. Notice  I write the queso part of it in caps. Well upon receiving the quesadilla  we notice that there is no cheese in it. When we ordered his plate we asked for no Cojita cheese  which is the small powder looking cheese thats simply sprinkled on top as a garnish with the tomatoes. So imagine our surprise when the QUESAdilla comes with no cheese. Once I brought it to the waiters attention he took it to the back. Where another one of the kitchen staff loudly started yelling at him very rudely how we had ordered it without cheese and that s how they made it. Granted I was not standing nor sitting within feet of the kitchen. So the fact that I heard her from where i was at meant that she was being very loud and rude. So I proceeded to go up there and tell her that I ordered the plate with no Cojita cheese only  I did want the regular standard mozzarella cheese that comes in a quesadilla. I also explained to her why anyone in their right mind would order a steak QUESAdilla and not want cheese. If that was the case I could have just as easily ordered plain steak tacos. To make matters worse my gorditas were uneatable to say the least  however I tried to eat them anyways because we had already paid  25 for this horrible meal. As soon as I got to work you can rest assure it all came back up the same way it went down.   In the end  I WILL NOT be returning. Which is sad to say because my family and I have been loyal customers to this restaurant for 20  years  however the quality of the food and staff has deeply deteriorated.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,114,Best little Mexican spot in the neighborhood. Amazing tortilla soup and their chicken is soooo good.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,115,Pull up and it 8 30 and their sign says closes at 9 but doors are locked and I see people putting up chairs and one of them yells back toward the counter but all of them ignore me at the door... Totally rude and disrespectful.  Closing early and doesn t even the manners or maturity to let me   a customer who s standing at the door know.. I will never return... Way too many other Tex-mex places to choose from to put up with this..
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,116,This was really not great in the least. Every single item I had was soggy in some way. My burrito was leaking a steady drip of bean mixture out the bottom the entire time I tried to eat it  before complete disintegration   everything was fairly bland  and then as a really bizarre cherry on top of everything... someone came by and cleared my plate before I was even done  so quickly I couldn t even protest it... not that I would have asked for it back  but it did make me laugh  so two stars for that.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,117,It s bad review day. Zuzu s has good if uninspired Mexican food. They use real lettuce and have very good grilled vegetables and black beans. You can get a nice nacho salad or fish tacos or a burrito  etc.  Salsa bar is nice too. Chicken is good.  Steak  is pretty flavorless. My problem is with customer service. No one is actively unpleasant  indeed  you generally get smiles. But don t try to get anything special. Some time ago I asked for a larger container for sauce than the tiny ones at the salsa bar. We d ordered guacamole and chips and sauce so that seemed reasonable to me. No no and no. Completely shut down. I took my lumps. Yesterday we did a  37.00 phone order. My friend that called it in ordered chips and sauce and asked for extra chips. The person she talked to said if we wanted more than they gave us to just ask and he would give them to us. So when I got there I asked. Oh man they weren t going to give me extra chips. I held them to it but it was very unpleasant. Rassled to the ground over  2.00. I can t imagine they thought I was lying.  I really hate losing Zuzu s as we have been getting lunch there for years but I m out.  When it comes to customer service people vote with their feet.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,118,Have seen this place plenty of times while driving on Mopac. Was in a bind the other week and needed to pick up something quick and good to eat on the way to a meeting  thought I was going to get fed at the meeting  so hadn t planned my meals appropriately that day when the news came in otherwise  . Rather than going the drive-thru fast food route  I decided to pop into what looked like a neighborhood gem and I am so glad I did. The food was fast  cheap and handmade. I went for the quesadillas and then got all my favorite fixins at the salsa bar  onion  cilantro  pico and verde salsa . The food was hot  fresh and delicious...and I still made it to the meeting on time  but didn t have my stomach grumbling from fast food establishment grease or on empty. Thank you  Zuzu 
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,119,I really  really liked this place and will be back soon.    We were in the mood for Mexican food but also didn t want to break the calorie budget.  I suppose I could pick at something somewhere else  but I heard yelpy rumors that this place was a  the bomb-diggity and b  pretty healthy.  I checked out the menu and it looked legit  so off we went.  Super cheap prices for what you got  and I got whole wheat tortillas  yummy chicken  not-fried fish  beans that were not fried in lard  a side salad  and it just tasted fresher and less artery-clogging than your normal tex mex.  My husband  who was paying a little less attention to his diet  got to get your normal fare and he absolutely loved his meal as well.  I would be back here more often  but it s just a wee-bit outside the normal commute-to-lunch zone  but I m about to make an exception this week  because now I m salivating on my keyboard thinking about my meal.  Thanks Zuzus    
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,120,For a quick lunch  I sometimes pop in here and order the Black Bean Musical Fruit Nacho Salad. I am a bean freak so steer clear if you see me eating this salad. Actually  my body does not create gas. I m one of the few people in the world who does not pass wind. Cut the cheese. Toot. Okay  that s more than enough of my 12 year old boy persona.  This salad is truly delicious and begins with a layer of tostado chips  then lots of crisp romaine lettuce  black beans  fresh tomatoes  cojito cheese tossed in a rosemary lime vinegarette with a scoop of guacamole on top. Next  you have the option of adding anything you want from the salsa bar. Think about the addition of cilantro  onions  pico de gallo  red salsa  tomatillo salsa  jalapenos  lime and whatever else blows your skirt up. Oops  another fart joke. There I go  again  stinking up this review.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,121,ZuZu is a 5 minute drive from my Northwest Hills home.  I prefer Taco Deli because the potato egg cheese combination here has always been a little oily and off somehow.  Also the  1 charge for adding extra avocado is a little insane.   But  when pressed for time I often ordered breakfast tacos for my husband on Saturday mornings over the years.  The service here has never been great.  On any given day  you can walk in and find 4 out of 5 employees sitting at a back table eating together  they often bring their children to work as well and the kids are standing up on chairs eating ice cream.  They don t like to get up and take orders to say the least.  When the head boss is around things are fine  but we can t plan our trips here around his schedule.  Earlier this year  I purchased 3 breakfast tacos with extra  1 avocado for  10.10.  The credit card machine was acting up and the cashier swiped my card twice.  She assured me that everything was okay and I left the establishment to do my normal Saturday shopping.  My card was later declined when I tried to buy  400 worth of groceries at Costco and I was shocked to discover that the mostly Spanish-speaking cashier had charged me  110.00 for THREE BREAKFAST TACOS.     We all make mistakes  but she didn t even bother to address it with me while I was waiting 15 minutes for the tacos.  I called in 15 minutes before arriving  but the tacos STILL weren t ready by the way.   When I got them home to my husband  they were stone cold.  We were forced to dispute the charges with our bank because she somehow never correctly voided the transaction and a lengthy 5 business days passed before our money was returned to the card.  I was more angry about her lack of transparency then anything else.  If you make a mistake  own it.  It was pretty embarrassing to have to put back  400 of Costco merchandise.  We called the ZuZu manager and left a message that was never returned.  Needless to say  we haven t been back since.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,122,You re obsessed  a friend says to me as I chomp down on my fish taco.  Muwhat  I m mid-chew.  Obsessed. With the fish tacos. It s ridiculous.  Is not.   Why do you always have to act 5   Do not.  Exactly.   I can t have this conversation right now. See this  I point to the fish taco. This requires silence.   Lalalalalalalalalala   Now who s acting 5    Lalalalalalalalalalala   I hate you. But you  I look lovingly at the fish taco   I love.  Obsessed   Am not 
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,123,Dear Zuzu-  A lesson in cultural cheeses.  When I get Italian food  I want it to include mozzarella. When I get Mexican food  I want it to include cheddar.  The opposite is NEVER true.  Why did you put mozzerella on my breakfast taco   Furthermore  what disgusting flavor combination are you using in your eggs   Just like Dana B  I had to remove ALL of the egg from my breakfast taco. My new go-to hangover food nearly made me sick from the odd flavor combination that I just WASN T interested in.   Thank you and have a nice day.  PS your tortillas suck too.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,124,Zero stars. Ordered delivery on uber eats. Got a Holy chipotle and chimichanga  both with steak. Steak was BLACK. Literally burnt or just cooked re-heated 5 times. Ordered at 6 00pm. Disgusting and completely inedible. Waste of money. Who serves that  Was that burnt steak left over from yesterday  Been in restaurant business for 10 years. Would NEVER serve that crap to someone. Take the time to make a fresh batch. That s exactly how you lose customers--laziness.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,125,In a town with so many tacos...so little time...Zuzu s is at the bottom of the list. I can appreciate the concept of  the healthy fresh mex thing...but somewhere along the way...the flavor fell out...everything taco I have had there is crammed full of green leaf lettuce. Where IS the beef    The salsa bar is not bad...if there were only a decent meal in this place to slather the salsa with...we might  have something.  Every time I have gone there  I have been underwhelmed...not impressed with their pricey over lettuced everything. The counter service is nothing to write home about...just snotty order takers.  The place is usually squeaky bleach and ammonia clean...which I guess is nice  but when the aroma of cleaners overpowers the food smells...me no likey.  If I want Fish Tacos I will hold out for La Salsa...another chain of the fresh mex movement but they leave the flavor in and leave out the attitude.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,126,Zuzu s is very unique.  It s like they took Mexican food and built upon it.  It is Americanized  but not in that American cheese-food slices and Wonder-bread kind of way.    Everything here seems very fresh.  I could live off of their corn relish.  If you get the green salad  ask for the dressing on the side because they like to really soak that lettuce in oil  and it s too much.  I always either order the chicken tacos  highly recommended   or the veggie burrito.  Chicken tacos are wonderful with lots of lime  cilantro  onions  and pico.   The veggie burrito comes wrapped in a deep-fried tortilla.  It s like some kind of delicious burrito-donut.  A bit oily  but so tasty.     What I absolutely LOVE most about Zuzu s is the CONDIMENT BAR    I can help myself to all the pico de gallo I can stand  and pile mountains of cilantro onto every bite.   I love them forever for allowing me free access to cilantro.  Who else does that     Definitely take advantage of that bar.   Note to Zuzu s   how s about a second option of a larger container for the condiments   I always feel like I m generating too much trash having to fill up 3 containers of pico  2 of cilantro  etc..   Their iced tea is good  but they charge more for tea than soda  which seems a little weird  but that s ok.  I m not so sure how I feel about their breakfast tacos.  They re quite seasoned and the fillings are pretty roasted.  I got a couple potato egg cheese and thought for sure there must be meat in there because everything was so brown.   I wasn t particularly excited about it myself  but I bet a lot of other people would really appreciate these broasted breakfast tacos.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,127,Zu Zu is a nice neigborhood mexi-food place..   they serve a variety of dishes  mostly standard items  it comes off as kinda west-coast style.. definitely not tex-mex  and def. not jalisco style.. maybe its just tailored to the west austin yuppie family crowd...this isnt necessarily a knock on the place since it doesnt come off as snobby or pretentious  just trying to give you a feel of the vibe..   the staff is mostly mexican though  so i guess that counts for alot..   my favorite part of ZuZu is their salsa bar.. they have a nice variety of salsas  the verde is spectacular   sour creme  fresh diced jalepeno  celantro  and a few other goodies that make nice free add-ons to your meal..   I usually order the beef chimichanga  its a fried burrito topped with queso.. a calorie packed  scrumptious meal.. the chipotle chicken enchiladas are also a good bet.. and they make really good breakfast tacos in the AM.. try the chorizo egg and cheese..2 of m and you might skip lunch..   the prices are higher than your avg taqueria  but still reasonable.. you ll spend.. about  6-8 on an entree.   overall  ZuZu is a good quick meal if youre looking for a place around 2222 and Mopac..  peace out  Chappy  a href   redir url http 3A 2F 2Fwww.tacotown.org amp s 7c8940a50440c86e97317a383ed950e9561b4cd1f042de102a73dfcc035130c6  rel  nofollow  target  _blank  tacotown.org  a 
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,128,SUCKS - Staff wasn t very friendly and were to busy talking and hollering at other staff members.  The tables that were empty were still very dirty and no clean places to sit.  Prices were on the high side for the food.  The napkin holder was completly empty and everyone had to go to the cashier which was getting mad but refused to go fill it up.    Only reason for 3 stars is the Chips and Queso were good.  Not sure if I will return or not.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,129,My second experience going here was better than the first  I m pleased to say.  This time I got the steak enchiladas  and boy were they yummy.  The portion size of the meal was enough for both my husband and I to share.  This time the sides were better too.  We got the corn relish and black beans.  Yum.  Also  I saw where they had a sign up that said  Monday-Wednesday night kids get two kids items free when an entree is ordered.   This is just another way to say kids eat free Monday-Wednesday.  I think that s cool.  Oh   I forgot to say that they also threw in a surprise free taco   Cool 
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,130,I ve been on a Taco kick lately. That s putting it mildly. So  it was the notion of having a taco  close to where my daughter has her Saturday Activities that enticed me to come in. What I found was a lot less taco and a lot more....other stuff.  OK  NEWS Folks  Not every Mexican joint in town is really a taco place. Guess I had forgotten about that. In fact  with such a limited choice of taco ingredients  Zuzu is a bit odd. But not bad. The food is fresh here and is in the top half of what I have tried around town. The salsa is good  a pretty authentic tasting green. The chorizo is tasty. They have gorditas. I have found that the word  gordita  and the word  sope  tend to get used interchangeably around town. The Zuzu version was not bad. But it was a whole note flat of La Fruta Feliz. The chicken was a bit dry. Masa cake not quite as flavorful as I have grown to love at the other place.   They offer whole wheat tortillas  which is always a nice concession. I had one. Non-traditional but good. Prices are very reasonable. A 3 gordita platter for about 6 bucks can make a nice breakfast or lunch for you.  So you get fresh  tasty and reasonably priced here. What s not to love about that 
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,131,This place has consistently good food.  I love the way the salad is always fresh.  My tummy always thanks me  so I can tell this is probably one of most health conscious mexican food menus in town.  The black beans are really good and I love the chip boat.  I usually order their quarter chicken meal.  It never disappoints.  I have eaten my way from the top of the menu to the bottom.  It s all good.  And the portions are just enough to satiate  not so much you feel guilty or sick.  I recommend you try a little of everything from the salsa bar.  It s not like the Taco Cabana where you have to worry about the cleanliness.  This place is always spotless.   I even tried to eat some of the chopped jalpenos  but they were pretty darn hot even for this native Texan.  Try the Mango iced tea  you won t be sorry.  It s delicious and it will put that jalapeno fire out in a hurry.  The service is great.  If you ve been coming here for the last 9 years or so it s been open  then you know that they have some of the same faces working behind the counter besides the owner  who is always nice by the way .  This says a lot to me about the working conditions.  The same girl that has worked the register since they opened has become a very confident woman from when I saw her for the first time and now.  I am happy to give them five stars.  They always come through for me in a pinch.  The restaurant lies in that comfortable zone above fast food but below a restaurant dining experience  but you sure can t tell once you start eating this delightfully light alternative to the usual Mexican fare.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,132,I read most of the other reviews  and decided to at least give this place a try. Mainly because it s right down the street. The decor hurts my eyes. It s bright and tacky.   The salsa bar is great  and the best was the tangy green salsa. Delish. I had a bean  potato and avocado breakfast taco. It was just that. Simple. The tortilla was great  crispy and chewy at the same time.   The husband had a sunrise breakfast platter  it s like a burrito thing. A massive burrito jammed with eggs and breakfasty stuff. He said it was okay  exactly what it was supposed to be. No surprises. Except the huge chunk of watermelon on the side.   So  zuzu s is just that. A simple  tasty  cheap breakfast.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,133,Came here for a groupon  didn t turn out extraordinary. I ordered the Mahi Mahi platter with black beans and roasted potatoes  but they seem to have replaced my potatoes with their  authentic  Mexican rice which consisted of corn and peas. The pureed black beans are served in a corn chip bowl. The beans tasted pretty good  but the chip tasted like it was months past expiration  Food kind of smelled like dog food when it was handed to me. If you want some tex-mex or some traditional Mexican food  I would try looking elsewhere.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,134,Food was decent  but the meat on the tacos was very skimpy. The sides were generous serving sizes.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,135,Got a breakfast taco  beans potato cheese on corn. Thought I d eaten a BRICK  or the wet mortar at least. The hot sauces  They look nice  but have no flavor  just like the tacos.   Plus really snotty people working there. I won t be back  and you should avoid it  too. Taco Cabana is better than this place.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,136,If you re in a rush  have a hankering for tex-mex but want something fresh and not all greased up then Zuzus is the place for you  oh and me too    There are two things on the menu that I order  the grilled chicken tacos and the grilled chicken salad. The tacos come on flour tortillas  lettuce  tomatoes and cojita cheese. You also get two sides. I always get the rice and refried black beans. The beans themselves come in a little corn shell which is a bonus if you are super hungry.   Their salsa bar is great and their green tomatillo sauce is the best. I cover everything in it    I always leave Zuzus full and satisfied.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,137,Has been OK in the past but today was awful. When we arrived for breakfast after 9 o clock  we were told potatoes were not ready yet. So we selected other items for our breakfast tacos. After paying our bill  including a generous tip   we discovered the lone coffee pot was empty. It took a few minutes before someone started making coffee. When it was finished  we discovered the container with cream was empty. Only after a few minutes did someone take the small pitcher back to the kitchen and refill it. After finishing a cup of coffee  I went back for a refill. The lone coffee pot was empty again. I told the young man at the counter about this. He looked at me and smiled. I sat down. Ten minutes later  no one had come forward to make more coffee. Only a few customers were seated. We left and will never return. Service was non-existent  The food was nothing special either.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,138,Note  The food is pretty damn good here.  Had an issue with an employee here a couple of weeks ago  emailed the owner   a href  mailto contact zuzuaustin.com  contact zuzuaustin.com  a   with my issue and have never heard back.  If you re going to have a contact email address on your site - respond when there are customer complaints  especially when they re serious.    A shame.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,139,I met a friend here every Thursday for lunch for several years  and it s funny how often I d see other people meeting regularly for lunch... so  this place is definitely a  let s get back there  kind of place.  It s dependable  the food s fresh and well-prepared  not too spicy and not too bland  the service is friendly  helpful and consistent.  Every now and then  my friend would order catfish tacos  go figure  for lunch  and it d take a little longer than usual for them to make it out to the table.  But what the heck  he liked them and it gave us more time to chat.      This place s quality and customer-friendly atmosphere is from the top down  the owner Russel A. is often behind the counter  and is a friendly host.  Most of the rest of the staff were the same for the years I ve been going there  which in today s world speaks volumes about how people are treated.   i.e. quite well   The food was always good  and there are a few things that stand out and deserve special mention     The peach mango iced tea is a flavorful treat  a departure from the ordinary run of the mill iced teas encountered elsewhere.  Mix it 50 50 with the regular tea to get your caffeine fix.  I never made it in the ladies room  but the men s room was always spotlessly clean and smelled like it had been scrubbed thoroughly with pine-sol about five minutes before I arrived.  It s nice to have clean restrooms when you re a grown-up  and when you ve got kids with you  it makes you feel good about bringing them along.    Really good food and a nice staff.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,140,I love you Zuzu.   I have loved you ever since I first laid eyes on your fresh salsa bar. Your queso is amazing...but that is not even the best part. You grill your tortillas so each breakfast taco has a little crunch to it...and the white cheese is all melty and delicious. You also make a mean chicken salad with yummy vinaigrette. And finally  as if it could not get any better  I read an article somewhere that you broke off from the Zuzu chain so that you could use fresh  healthy ingredients  like veggie stock instead of lard in the beans  for instance .
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,141,Actually 4.5 stars  but hey  I m feeling generous  since I just ate there and am in a happy place. Had the blackened catfish tacos with black beans and corn relish on the side. Usually fish tacos are made with fish and cole slaw  but these had an avocado slice and a delicious sauce  probably Adobo  spicy  smoky with a hint of chocolate. I didn t miss the cole slaw a bit.  The beans came in a small crisp tortilla bowl - a nice touch - and were wonderful. The corn relish was the only mis-step - it was okay  but a little bland. i think some onion  or some lemon juice would really bring the relish together. In any event  I d be happy to go back there again  and in fact look forward to going back.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,142,Very small portions  low quality food and to top it off....overpriced.  I will never eat there again.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,143,I am writing about Zuzu as I sit here and finish my meal. I have to say  I live up the road  was craving Mexican food  and still thought I d try  er out even though she has 3.5 average rating.  It s OK  not anything I d drive far for  but there sure were a lot of people enjoying themselves and their meals.  The service deserves 5 stars. They thanked me many times for my business and made me feel really welcome. I loved that. They made me feel like an important rock star. You know  because rock stars are important.  What I also liked about the place is that you order at the counter and they bring the food to you. I love that. I much prefer to do that than have a waitress.   The other thing that made me a happy camper is that I went out on a limb and tried their chicken. I only like white meat chicken  and sometimes you never know with Mexican restaurants. Sometimes the chicken is a little dark or slimy. Not here. It s actually pure white meat. And the texture is good. Not slimy   The food is OK. I felt like my portion was a little small and I m still hungry. But  the meal only put me back  6.50  so should I really be upset about that   They deliver  have happy hour and cater. They do it all. They have a big tv so you can watch the tube while you eat. Make sure you bundle up because it s cold in there  
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,144,I found the food to be really fresh and lots of options for fresh vegetables. It s become a regular go-to for quicker  healthier meals out  although  not ordering the fried stuff and quesadillas is difficult  
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,145,Decent place to meet up for a quick  order-at-the-counter lunch.  I love that they have so many vegetarian options  rice and black beans check out clean . My mango iced tea tasted pretty off  so the cashier said if I dumped it out  I could have a Coke. Uh  ok. The sides are key  since many platters come with your choice of things like corn or potatoes.  A pleasant change from the usual. Go  check it out. It s not really TexMex and it s not really Southwestern  but that s ok. Just know that you might get something different on your plate than you expected  but it ll be fine.  Key driving hint  it s next door to a McDonald s. And  if you turn north on Balcones  at the light behind the shopping center  you will have the chance to slingshot  aka fancy U-Turn  around to the front of the shopping center  which faces the Mopac frontage road.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,146,Great food. Almost as good as the Original Bellaire  Houston  location .. The downside is that this place tends be overrun with self absorbed child worshiping parents with loud  little kids so you really need to pick your day to enjoy a good meal. Plus  the staff seems very put out and rude  I have had a problem with every to-go order so check it before you leave...
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,147,I used to work right next door  so needless to say I didn t lose any weight during that time period.   but there are healthy  diet-friendly dishes you can get here  I just didn t always exercise self-control ...   Zuzu is a very bright little establishment filled with colorful drawings in primary colors.  they have a nice patio  but it is kinda loud  cause mopac is right there.  They serve beer and an assortment of mexican sodas  if that is your thing.  Things you must try  blackened catfish  shrimp tacos  shrimp quesadillas  fajitas  cheese enchiladas  chicken salad... not sure if I forgot anything.  They have great fluffy corn tortillas as well.  Their sides are awesome.  I love their black beans  corn salad  roasted potatoes  and green salad with a wonderful rosemary dressing.    i like that dressing on the potatoes  too .  The only problem is  which two sides to choose     There is a condiment bar with three salsas  I like the darker  thicker  red one best   mexican crema  pico  fresh diced jalapeno  cilantro  and fresh limes lemons.  Threre is also plain iced tea and a peach iced tea that is refreshing.  Buy a ZuZu cup and get refills for a buck.   They also have awesome breakfast tacos.  I love the bacon  egg  potato and cheese.  Oh  and their flan is out of this world delish   And their ZuZu sundae  the one with the works  is awesome  it comes in a crispy tortilla shell with gooey cajeta  caramel   amp  nuts...  Mmmmmmm...  The owner  Russell  is great  as is most of his staff.  Boy  I miss working next door to ZuZu 
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,148,I checked out ZuZu today for lunch and was pretty impressed. The unfortunate thing is that the rice and beans were better then my tacos.... that s good news if you are a rice and beans fan  but I would assume the majority of people come here for the main course. I wasn t that impressed with my first visit and I would have written the place off but   a  jessica s. says it s really good....   b The other food people were eating looking amazing. I just think the Tacos weren t the way to go.   c  It s decent Mexican food on the north side of town.   I will definitely be trying this place again. I got the Taco plate and a drink and it was  9.16... not crazy expensive  but definitely a lot more then I wanted to spend on lunch.... especially for tacos.  it also took a while for the food to come out and we were maybe 1 of 7 people in the restaurant and the only ones who hadn t been served food. I think we waited 20 minutes for one order of tacos....
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,149,I ended up lunching at ZuZu this past friday with my PIC and our friend  who had recommended the place. We found a coupon and somehow in the excitement of leaving the house for something besides an exam for the first time in days  I forgot to check the yelp status of ZuZu before heading out.  Feeling a little under the weather  and it having been a rather blustery day  I was determined to sample their Tortilla soup and possible some sort of taco salad creation.   ZuZu has a fast food feeling  but claims to have handmade Mexican food. All I know is that my tortilla soup appeared to be the salsa they were serving heated up  it had a very thick consistency  topped with the same chicken fajita strips that appeared in my PIC s enchiladas and on top of my chicken taco salad. The soup was inedible  the taco salad was lacking  when the menu described the salad as having  black beans  I was surprised when they were refried instead of whole- refried beans on lettuce is soggy and gross  especially when it s the main components of the dish. The fried tortilla bowl was sinful  but not good enough to make up for the extremely dry and tough chicken.  Basically  my PIC was pissed to have spent all that money  it s not cheap  Freebird s is WAYYY better for the price  when we could have gone to Polvo s  right next to our house. I was so disappointed I went to HEB later that night and made a big pot of MY tortilla soup which I served with a couple of Torchy s brushfire tacos  a much better meal than what we had at ZuZu
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,150,This is an amazing restaurant   The food is always fresh  The salsa bar is exceptional. The staff is courteous and friendly...
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,151,Food is GREAT... I mean... we ALL love it  It was a very nice change from the norm. Glad we tried this place.   However... the customer service... holy     Not pleased at all. Bought adult platters meals got kids free... the kids werent free  not the pizzas  rang it up and submitted while I was questioning it...even though Im questioning it he kept going until the order was complete. Why  You cant stop for a second and SPEAK TO ME    I just asked you if kids meals were free with adult purchase  you said yes.. then when I ordered pizzas you COULDNT TELL ME THEY WERENT INCLUDED   Just tell me. Fine then  let the kids pick out something else that IS included... we will STILL buy the pizzas.. ok  NOPE... cant do that.. it would be a separate ticket  this is within 3 minutes  Seriously  Horrible customer service.. all the while I stand there with ALL eyes on me  being as nice as I can be  and getting absolutely nowhere. I was so upset with ALL THAT... Im not sure if we will go back. Yes  the food was good... but hey. Customer service is the TRUE GEM.... and they lack it.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,152,Good Salsa and Queso  Average Food  BAD customer service.  I had a groupon for Zuzus and used it and ordered extra... the cashier was extremely rude about the groupon and didn t give me a receipt or my change and started helping another customer before I was even done ordering    Good place to go when you re in a hurry  just don t bring a groupon or expect friendly service.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,153,So  you really have to keep an eye on your order here. It took them three times to get my order correct. What was weird is I only asked for three things on my taco... Once I got it  it was average at best.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,154,Their salad was oily and unimpressive.  Each leaf was covered with oil.  I would advise staying away from ordering their grilled chicken salad if you go there.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,155,Quite decent. Place is clean  food is ok  prices are good. A little to tilted to the Tex side of Tex-Mex for my taste.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,156,Not a fan at all. I got the chicken enchiladas w the roja sauce. all tasted the same to me and the roja sauce tasted weird. The mixed veggies weren t good and I actually saw three plates that left them behind too.  my husband had the chicken burrito and he said it was decent but nothing special. The service was nice and the open hot sauce bar was good. My fav part was the chips and hot sauce. I definitely won t be back
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,157,The breakfast taco is delicious my boyfriend picked up our food but he said there was a really good salsa bar.  He brought back all kinds of salsa and they were all tasty. I got the potato  egg  and cheese breakfast taco and I wish I had ordered another  My boyfriend got the sunrise platter   bacon on it and it had a great taste and it came with potatoes and a slice of watermelon that was sooooo good. It was super fast they said our to-go order would be done in 5 minutes and he didn t have to wait for it when he went in. We usually go to Taco Deli and Zuzu is now on my list of favorite breakfast tacos 
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,158,I dropped in for lunch late last week after reading some decent things on Yelp.   Boy  was I disappointed.  Everything I ate was ok  but just average at best.  The tacos were bland  the beans had little or no flavoring and I just was no impressed.  I guess I ll continue my quest for a good  quick mexican spot near Mopac and 183.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,159,Good food  fast and friendly service. Large serving with plenty left over. Get place for a quick meal.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,160,I recently had lunch here and got a chicken spinach burrito special. Delicious  It was a bit pricey  but ultimately worthwhile. The downside was that it was extremely greasy. I ve eaten bacon with less grease on it. I know it was oils  but still...it feels nasty. Maybe I m getting old  but I hate having to use tons of napkins after a meal unless I m eating chicken wings or something...  I could really enjoy this place  if I can make it out for lunch with any frequency. And if my budget really allowed for it as often as I d like.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,161,Zuzu is a fun family restaurant in the far west area. The food is a great price and is pretty healthy. The black bean pur e that can be selected as a side is really tasty. My fianc  and I love this place and will miss it when we move. Every Texas neighborhood has a great Texmex  zuzu is more mex than tex  and zuzu fills that role here.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,162,I was recently introduced to Zuzu by a friend  and have eaten there 3 times in the span of one week . Had the grilled mahi mahi tacos twice  and the chicken enchilada platter once  with the green sauce . The food is VERY fresh  the staff is great  and aside from it s hidden location    tucked away in a strip mall adjacent to a McDonalds   this place is GREAT. It s not upscale dining in terms of atmosphere  or price but who cares  It s clean  bright and simple  the food is fresh  made to order and delicious. I was tempted to give it 5 stars... I ll test a few more menu items and revisit my rating.  This is seriously GOOD FOOD   
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,163,This place is pretty much a once-a-week staple for my family. The food is very fresh  and high-quality ingredients are the rule. The place is clean and modest and the service is good. ZUZUs definitely straddles the line between fast-food and a sit-down restaurant  the food arrives insanely quick--maybe too quick if you re enjoying some free happy hour queso   but the quality of the food pivots the place squarely out of the realm of traditional fast-food.   I am very health conscious eater  and I appreciate that ZUZUs gives me the ability to dive into some Tex-Mex style food  but not finish with that high-fat  processed-cheese  lard-based guilt-inducing coma most Tex-Mex restaurants leave me with. The Rosemary Vinaigrette salad is a standby side  as is the corn salad  and the black bean puree. The fried veggie burrito platter they serve is one of my favorite plates in town  and the grilled chicken salad is a standby too. Not to say you can t go traditional as the Mole Enchiladas are incredible  and the Mole is handmade and very nice and smoky. The Holy Chipotle steak burrito always delivers moist and tender shredded steak and veggies that are perfectly seasoned in a huge  tender  flour or whole wheat tortilla.   They have an amazing free salsa and pico bar and great homemade tortilla chips too. The restaurant is non-pretentious  it s in a quiet strip-mall   and the decor is pretty bland  but the staff are very friendly and they get to know their regulars.  And families with kids seems to be the rule on weeknights  an ideal place for dining with younger ones . It s not trying to be the next classic tex-mex dive like El Patio  or powerhouse local chain like Maudie s  but ZUZUs does occupy a unique spot in the Tex-Mex pantheon that is Austin  healthier Tex-Mex. If you re looking for high-quality  great-tasting  less expensive  less waist expanding Tex-Mex  that doesn t break the bank  try ZUZUs.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,164,I like this place.  I don t understand why so many bad reviews.  This is not a fancy restaurant so your expectations need to temper down to a fast casual level.  Their salsa bar always has been good.  Their enchiladas are consistent.  I like their potatoes.  I like their Spanish rice with corn in it.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,165,To put it simply  Zuzu s is quick  fresh  and tasty.   I ve been here for lunch twice- the line always moves quickly  and the food comes out in  5 min. The waitstaff great you with smiles  and the food isn t particularly expensive.   I m not a huge fan of the decor  but hey  everything else makes up for it. They ve got a fantastic condiments and salsa bar. You ve got jalapenos  pico  onions  and anything else you could want up for self-serve. I really appreciate this  and it s incredibly fresh. The salsas are nice a tasty -salsa verde  Yes please  I d like some tang with my food.   The mahi mahi taco platter was a little bland  but the cilantro-chile sauce served with it makes up for the lack in flavor. I ordered the achiote-roasted chicken a while back  as well. I appreciated the portion and flavor  but it was admittedly a little dry. This should  probably lower my review to 3 stars  but hey - the self-serve bar will solve all your flavor and juicy needs     The sides are  pretty dang solid. The black beans are great  and the grilled veggies are tossed in a tasty rosemary-lime vinaigrette. I think I ve ordered the  average  food items thus far - I should just go with the trusty enchiladas next time.   Overall  the staff and food are great  and the convenience factor is through the roof with the quick service and the condiments salsa bar. Simple  no frills  Mexican food.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,166,Your review helps others learn about great local businesses.  If you happen to know the owner or have a conflict of interest  please don t review.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,167,We went to ZuZu s for breakfast tacos. Our food was great. I loved the refried black beans. The atmosphere is nice and the people who work there are friendly. They have a good happy hour daily and all day on Saturdays  a decent selection of beer  and are getting ready to add margaritas at this location.  They have a good outdoor seating area for when the weather is nice. I d plan to work  and eat a late lunch  here in the afternoons  but I had to score them -1  for not having WiFi. Too bad  would be a nice place to go and a break from my usual routine.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,168,One of my favorite places to eat mexican tacos and fajitas.    Their flan is dangerously good 
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,169,Yummy avocado tacos with great black beans. Didn t care too much for the  Mexican  rice  though. Will definitely get those tacos again 
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,170,Completely disappointed. Rice was mush and had a  weird  taste that I can only describe as  not right . The corn  which I can only assume was expired  was nothing but lime flavor and soggy texture. A waste of time and money.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,171,ZuZu has been around for quite some time  but I never made my way over either for breakfast  lunch  or dinner. But I certainly had to give any joint with capitals mid-title a shot. It is totally hip and conducive to a cult following. Ex.  Hey  how about ZuZu for lunch    When I actually went over to this iconic Tex-Mex eatery to grab a quick bite in the wee hours of the morning  I found it to be quite solid. They are even doing something that I have longed for  though it is not very traditional  a breakfast taco... without the hefty tortilla  corn or flour. The bowl is quite the winner.  For  2.15 you get a whole mess of stuff... meaning 3 ingredients  the 3 of which typically find themselves in tacos. I don t always want to invest my daily meals into pressed Mexican staples  so this was awesome. The potatoes were heavily seasoned  almost salty  which is totally OK   the refried blacks were hearty and creamy  and the sliced avocado was fresh  not brown in the least.  Salsas are fresh and vibrant. The tomatillo is tart and light. The red is crisp  and the onions allow a good bite. The pico was fresh chopped  for good cause.  Other than tacos  they are offer much in the way of plates and platters  with your typical fare i.e. queso  burritos  fried grub. They are doing Tex-Mex fare one notch higher here because they know what matters to the individuals who care to drive out to this odd location off of Mo-Pac. That being said  patronize this eatery and see what they have to offer.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,172,I am such a stick-in-the-mud when it comes to ZuZu but they have the best tortilla soup ever and so that is all I ever order.  I love it along with chips and the green salsa.  Add a ZuZu cup filled with ice cold Dr. Pepper and I am in Heaven     When I was pregnant with my first son  12 years ago  my husband and I would always go to ZuZu before attending our childbirth classes at Seton Northwest.  Food really wasn t my friend during either pregnancy but ZuZu s tortilla soup helped me make it through.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,173,we love this place for breakfast. Love the gorditas  amp  the picadita platter. they serve roasted veggies and fruit as side options so we get a lot more nutrition than the usual taco joint. tacos are on the small side  but everything is fresh. the salsas are great and the spice bar is loaded up and clean.   i m always surprised but it is never really crowded  and the staff is nice. its counter service  and good for a low stress  fairly healthy breakfast out for the family.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,174,Fast service in a great atmosphere. Wide variety of food choices. You won t be disappointed 
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,175,I was out running errands and had driven past this place a zillion times so I stopped in to get some lunch on the run.  Here in Austin  we have a plethora of wonderfully delicious mexican places-so save your money and go to Tacodeli  Torchy s or a great little taqueria.  Hell  even Taco Cabana is better if you are desperate and on the run like I was.  I had some kind of weird combo plate and the only thing good was the chicken flauta.  So  I basically spent like  15 to eat a chicken flauta.  I will never return and I wished someone had warned me.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,176,The food here is fresh  and the service quick. Given all of the Mexican choices nearby  this is not the fanciest  but one of the best in the quick-serve category.  I trend toward the salads and the spinach chicken burrito  which is filled with fresh slightly sauteed spinach. Great flavors  and the lime vinaigrette added to several menu items is fantastic.  Get fresh salsa from the salsa bar  and enjoy the TVs  which have the volume low enough that your conversations are not drowned out.  Never a line here  and the staff is friendly  helpful and quick.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,177,Was really in the mood for enchiladas the other day  had heard a few good things about them so I thought why not give them a try.   I was completely let down. The food was average  sauce tasted odd  and there was hardly any cheese in the enchilada. The queso  I am pretty sure  was velveeta and rotel  though they did have some nice salsas.  The rice was ok  but the pureed black beans were just weird. They served them in a tortilla bowl  not something you would put a liquid in  and as it got soggy the beans leaked out.   Basically it is 3 steps up from taco cabana. A friend raved about the shrimp tacos  so I may go back to give those a try.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,178,Great lunch spot   Love the salad topped with grilled chicken  or the fish tacos w  corn tortillas. Also LOVE the green salsa from the salsa bar. The red s good too  but I LOVE the green  The only thing I ve had here that I really didn t like was the corn relish that comes as a side dish. Very oily and unappetizing.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,179,Yumm.  Migas are tasty but rubbery.  Oh well.  10 different hyperfresh condiments.  Friendly staff.  Really clean place.  Comfy and convenient.  I will try the mahi mahi tacos next time.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,180,Place is amazing and no matter how many years go by it stays amazing   If U are a true austinite U no about this place and I don t even have to explain why it s 5 stars
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,181,I usually love this place  I ve never had a bad experience-ever. And then I went back after about 6 weeks time. I can t say enough how disappointed I was this last visit. The red salsa tasted like it had fomenting for a few days. The chips were stale  and the Chicken flautas were recooked and had bad meat in one of them. I can t say I ll be going back anytime soon after that extremely bad experience.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,182,What can I say  just not very good.  I always judge a mexican food place by the beans and rice.  I figure if they take the time to make good beans and rice  then they probably put that kind of effort into the rest of the food.  Zuzu s beans and rice were totally bland.  Flautas are lack luster.  The chicken nachos are pretty good  the chicken has good flavor and the mexican pizza is okay.  Not great  not terrible.  Probably won t be back.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,183,I was pleasantly surprised by this place. I had a burrito  and it was delicious. The sides were pretty blah  but it might be my fault since I pretend I m on a healthy kick every other day  so I ordered the salad and corn relish. Neither were bad  but nothing interesting at all.   No free chips makes me cry a little  especially when they had such a fun little salsa bar. Tease   Anyway  I really liked the burrito  the rice and beans were yummy and the cheese really stood out nicely. I was worried when I read other people s complaints  but it s actually a nice little deviation.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,184,As a lover of Zuzu s for almost 20 years  I ve tolerated the lackluster service but yesterday was the final straw. Called them at 7 50am to order breakfast tacos for my son. Showed up at 8 08am  sign says they open at 8am  and doors were still locked. There were also two guys waiting who said this was a frequent occurrence. Doors were finally opened at 8 10am and they hadn t even started making my order. First  don t answer the phone before opening if you are going to ignore someone s order. Second  if the sign says you open at 8am than shouldn t the doors be unlocked but more importantly  shouldn t you be ready to start cooking then  Lastly  the response of the person at the register was so apathetic that I wonder how many others have had this experience and walked away. For a locally owned business that has to compete with the likes of Taco Deli and Torchy s  you need to step it up in a big way.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,185,Pretty decent place. There are loads of good veg options and the food comes out really fast  that s a huge plus. The only negative would be the  specials  don t really change... So they aren t so special.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,186,I have always raved about their food because its Real  Fresh Food. My review has to do with their environment... while I was there   they had Ridiculousness on MTV- and it made me sick to my stomach  seriously- I had to leave the restaurant. I wanted to throw up. Maybe that show is popular- but you should think about people that are eating food... and certain stuff like bloody doctor shows  or gruesome pranks are not great. I wasted my money and I can honestly say that it will be a long time before I try them again.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,187,The owner has tracked down and confronted -IN PERSON-  2 reviewers of his restaurant and banished them from his restaurant because they did not give him a favorable review. I will not be going back to this establishment and I don t think you should either unless you ONLY give them 5 stars.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,188,Pretty decent Tex-Mex for those in a hurry. It s technically a sit down restaurant  but you get your food fast. There are your regular options as well as more healthier ones. And they have a really good salsa bar. That s the good. Here s the bad. Like URWhatUEa T says  there s plenty of out of control children. I d expect that at Chuck E Cheese  but ZuZu s  Not so much. I had a hard time biting my tongue every time kids ran by my table. If you don t mind that sort of thing then no worries.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,189,I usually have the catfish tacos or the grilled chicken salad  and it s always good. The people are always friendly  amp  the food is fast.  A reliable standby 
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,190,When I moved to this area  ZuZu sent me a coupon for a free entree or 2 free tacos  so I decided to check it out.  I got 2 breakfast tacos  which just seemed pretty standard to me.  But the salsas were excellent. That was the really memorable part of the meal  actually. I ll definitely go back for lunch or dinner sometime. I like the casual atmosphere and counter service  the prices seem very reasonable  and the food is fast and fresh.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,191,Barely above Taco Cabana quality of food at twice the Taco Cabana prices.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,192,I have been going to this restaurant for years. The food is great for what you would expect. It is a casual fast food restaurant where you order at the counter and then seat yourself. The food has always come out as I ordered and fairly quickly. I really enjoy the food. The queso is excellent.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,193,i gotta give zuzu this....always dependable.  i ve tried a variety of dishes from both the breakfast and dinner menu.  nothing has disappointed me yet.  breakfast is quite yummy with good sized portions.  i adore the mini taco bowl filled with black beans.  i could eat 5 of them if my tummy wasn t already stuffed with other zuzu goodness.  one thing i am always surprised about is the patrons.  families with kids are everywhere.  the decor caters to the children...so maybe that s what attracts the kiddies.    the pick-up wait can be pretty long if you go during dinner hour.  be prepared.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,194,I like cheap greasy Mexican food  but the oil slick coming off my sides here tasted and smelled like an Exxon spill. I m not sure how they roasted the potatoes or what chemicals where in the corn relish  but it s been two hours and I still feel sick.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,195,I love Zuzu s     Best fresh mexican food ever  There is nothing to complain about  I love it every time    
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,196,I can sum up the breakfast tacos with a simple word... Yuck.  I have tried the breakfast tacos at ZuZu s twice and both times I have been very disappointed.   My eggs were overcooked  dry  brown and tasted like chorizo.  I slathered on a ton of salsa  which was good  so that gets them a star  and I still could taste overcooked eggs.  I ended up throwing out the eggs and having a potato breakfast taco.  Ummm... not at all what I wanted.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,197,My husband and I are Zu Zu fans. We really like the Grilled Chicken Salads and the salsa bar. This is not traditional Tex-Mex  which is why I think its very good. It s different and fresh feeling  everything doesn t have to be fried with queso all over it. Its also nice to have other side options because Austin has so many Mexican Food and Tex Mex options. The staff is friendly. The food is fresh and always feels fresh  not like it was sitting in the back for hours before being served. The dining area and kitchen look clean. The patio is cared for and tables are usually ready for you to sit at  and don t need to be cleaned off before you sit down. Also  the food is usually are mark each time we visit or take out. They are consistent with the product  service and environment. I would recommend it to others looking for a different twist on salads and salsa. Its reasonably priced also and the peach tea is amazing  Give it a try. It is worth it and it is different.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,198,I ate there for the first time today at lunch.  The order was brought to the table and they had gotten one of the sides wrong  but the server fixed it right away.  The food was fresh and very tasty. I had the steak chimichanga  the corn salad and the roasted potatoes.  All of it was wonderfully delicious.  I will be returning  I m quite sure.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,199,Update  After being contacted by an apologetic manager a few weeks back  my wife and I returned to Zuzu this week. The food and service was good  and the queso free   so they are getting a 1-star bump up.  My wife and I are looking for a good replacement for Willy s Mexican Grill  in Atlanta  and stumbled across Zuzu.  First time in  we were definitely not impressed by their service  - Took over 10 mins for them to take our order with only 2 people ahead of us.  - We were charged a couple of dollars more than the prices on the menu for our two items - and they supposedly cannot give a detailed receipt showing what we were charged for each item. They could only give me a copy of the credit card receipt. - Then  they would only give us one  stamp  on their frequent-buyer club since we paid together - even though the card reads one stamp per entree.  But  we got free queso and chips under their  Zuzu happy hour  and the food was good. So  while we were irked by the poor service  we were determined to try again.  So  tonight  we are on our way home and deciding between Zuzu and Rudy s  quite a difference  we know... . So  I call to inquire if they are doing the free queso thing tonight. I am told yes they are  come on in    Well  we get there and are told rather rudely that no  they are not doing the free queso tonight  can t you read the sign  Oh well  we are here anyways... so  we order separately - this time paying with separate credit cards to get our two stamps. And  nope.. doesn t work  they refuse to give us two stamps - even on separate frequent-buyer cards.  While my experiences may not seem like a big deal...  and they aren t a big deal .. there is just too much good food in Austin to waste time at places like Zuzu.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,200,Zuzu is an pleasant place to get a fast and potentially healthy lunch. I recommend the bbq catfish tacos. The catfish is lovely  the sauce isn t overpowering  and the corn tortillas are to die for. I get the corn relish as a side and put a bunch in the tacos. Most excellent 
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,201,Been coming to Zuzu s for years. Love this place  always friendly helpful staff. Great  fresh  fast mexican food. Fills you up  doesn t cost a lot and its fresh. Not off of some truck  frozen and reheated. I love their Spinach Chicken Salad  chicken bbq tacos  and their chorizo breakfast tacos.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,202,Stopped in here because it was on the way to my appointment and I was short on time. I only had the spinach chicken salad so I can t review on the burritos or tacos. My salad was just okay. The chicken on top was swimming in grease. That s reason enough for me to not go for another visit.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,203,The service is non existent.  I agree with a previous reviewer that although there are many employees in the store  no one is in a rush or happy to help you.  No real greeting and you get some eye avoidance.  I have yet to go in and not observe an employee on their cell phone or in the dining are  I think I typically am there at non peak time but you would expect a more attentive staff .  They get three stars because their food is fresh and I enjoy their breakfast tacos.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,204,If allowed  I d probably give 3.25 to 3.5 stars. While I m sure Zuzu isn t the best Mexican or TexMex that can be found in Austin  I must say I enjoy waking up to hot breakfast tacos when I stay at my dad s. It s nearby  fast  cheap  and pretty tasty. I haven t had much else on the menu beyond the aforementioned  but it s just because I m always so satisfied with what I order  I have never felt the need to.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,205,Overall  Zuzu s is pretty good. I LOVE their Grilled Chicken Salad  Some of the other dishes are a little bland  but still good.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,206,I m a sucker for soft chicken tacos and these are among the best I ve ever had. I think their salsa bar is fantastic and I ve tried all the sides they have and my favorite are the black beans in the crispy edible bowl and the Mexican rice. All fresh stuff here and affordable. I also think their soda selection is a breath of fresh air. They have the most interesting variety. I m a tea fan but I consider the sodas here.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,207,A very nice place near far west  Good food  had a chicken fajita  wherein the chicken had nice flavor to it  and very tasty salas. The sides were good too especially the black beans and roasted potatoes  again very flavorful . My friends too liked their burrito and sides. I would definitely return to this place to try other stuff.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,208,I love Zuzu  I stick with the chicken tacos  covered with extra cilantro and onion and one of their great salsas. Everything tastes so fresh here  and I love the sides. The salad is dark green and leafy  with a light rosemary dressing unlike anything else in town. The black beans are pureed and come in a little crispy corn shell. Perfect. Everything they bring to your table looks really good  and is even more delicious. My husband always gets the steak in his tacos  and it s great. I can actually feel good about eating here. This is always a treat. They do a great job  and I hope they stick around  as I never tire of this gem.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,209,Horrible place...food is very tasteless.  You will only thin that this is a good place if you have never been to any other Mexican food place before.  Only went here because I had a Groupon...won t be going back.   STAY AWAY 
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,210,An extra star for the staff and the service.  Even during an extremely busy lunch  they were friendly and prompt.  That being said  the food was bland.  The salsas were boring and my burrito was less-than-memorable.  I would pay less for a tastier meal at Taco Bell.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,211,This place has been a favorite of mine for several years now. With good food  friendly faces  and decent pricing I eat here at least once a week.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,212,Went with family to eat at Zuzu s for Sunday lunch. The food was authentic and good.  The restaurant was a mess. Very few customers but a lot of dirty tables and no one working to clean up.  The staff was disinterested.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,213,Helpful hints to make your experience at Zuzu s better   Go on Saturday for the free chips and queso  Saturday all-day special .  Next  get a  1.75 import beer  also a Saturday all-day special   and order a taco or two a la carte.   chicken was pretty good   Next  go to the salsa bar  and dump some pico de gallo  onion  cilantro  and a little salsa in your queso and stir.  Munch repeatedly.  Get more beers and queso refills.  Sit outside and be glad you in Austin.  Enjoy.    Their breakfast can be good as well  but it sometimes turns out to be hit or miss.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,214,Meh. I like the idea better than the execution. Fresh ingredients  locally-owned  bright paint  how can you go wrong  I m not sure  but Zuzu manages to do it.  I had the Mexican cheesesteak  super burrito  - not sure what was super about it  because it was pretty small and didn t seem to have all the ingredients the menu said it did. I m pretty sure the menu listed beans  rice  meat  cheese  lettuce. All I found for the most part was tough meat - and I mean REALLY tough - hard to chew - and a LOT of lettuce  with a very tasty sauce that was only evident in about 1 3 of the burrito. It almost seemed like the burrito was rolled the wrong direction because one side was so saucy it got all over me  and the other half didn t have ANY sauce evident at all. And the only melted cheese was at the very bottom of one half - it was really good with melted cheese  I sure wish that had been included throughout the whole thing. The menu also mentioned it was served with queso  but there was not anything that resembled queso on my burrito. Overall  it was small  tough  inconsistent  seemed to be missing half the ingredients  and not worth the price at all.  The bf has been a loyalist of this place  and he says he has  gotten used to  the food. I don t want to have to  get used to  the food. It s either good or it isn t  and this just isn t. He had a blackened catfish platter of some kind  and there was so little fish he had a hard time finding it under a pile of finely chopped veggies. It was a SERIOUSLY small quantity of fish.  I tasted his corn relish  and didn t care for it at all. Just had a flavor I didn t like. I didn t try the rice he got  but it looked ok.   He tells me I didn t like it the last time we went either  which I don t remember. I guess that s to be expected  since the food really is not memorable. But the paint is nice 
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,215,This is my go-to worked too late  had no lunch  I m famished so feed me quick place. They are fast  efficient  and totally satisfying. I usually get the fish tacos with black beans and corn relish  however  I totally love the spinach chicken salad. It has hard-boiled eggs  tomato  and guac in it as well with tortilla strips for crunch. I usually skip their dressing because their vinaigrette is crazy oily. I sub at home a L F smoky ranch chipotle instead. This is a special on the chalkboard  not on the menu. I just discovered their chicken fajitas. Very good and packed full of grilled veggies. Pretty much everything here is in the  7- 10 range  so the price is right. They have good iced tea and a stocked salsa bar with my favorite  avocado tomatillo salsa. It s fast food with fresh  healthier flare.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,216,My favorite place to eat for a daily lunch or dinner.  Problem is since the owner is not there lately the place has gone a little down hill.  The food is great but the manager  I think she s the manager  spends a lot of time on the phone and ignores the customer.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,217,I just finished a 24hr fast and the first place I wanted to eat for lunch ZuZu    had the beautiful Blackened Catfish  with roasted potatoes and vegetables.... Oh so good   Got chips and Salsa because the SALSA is amazing  sweet  with just enough spice and salt and perfect amount of CILANTRO oh what a way to end a fast. Thanks ZuZu   
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,218,Nice bright clean and colorful addition in an area that doesn t have many good fast food options.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,219,Zuzu was a favorite place of ours in Houston and we were happy to find one here when we moved  8 years ago  I live in the past  apparently .  Pretty much everything on the menu comes with two sides-- we invariably get the black beans  comes in a tostada bowl  and salad  curly romaine and tomatoes tossed in some kind of vinaigrette .  The food is fresh  healthier than standard-issue Tex-Mex  and consistent.  You order at the counter and they bring you your food.  There s a simple but good salsa bar.  The flan is fantastic.  Good place to take kids.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,220,I enjoyed the friendly customer service and good value.  I ve lived in the area for years  and I was surprised I hadn t noticed the location until coming across it in an online deal.  The blackened catfish tacos were delicious  and I was impressed with the amount of fish in the taco.  I m usually left disappointed with portion size when I order fish tacos at the few Mexican restaurants in Austin where it s available.  Beef fajitas were not anything out of the ordinary  but the price was good.  It s one of the few Mexican restaurants in this part of town  and I m looking forward to going back.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,221,It s very OK. We excused a lot for being local owned and fresh. We did not like the thick tortilla soup at all.We do like the corn tortilla tacos
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,222,Had a happy accident discovering Zuzu  Homemade corn tortillas with the migas were excellent  The salsa bar was full of options and delicious  and the freshly brewed mango-peach tea hit the spot. I appreciated the clean restaurant  friendly service  and the fact that we could have a conversation with our friends because music wasn t blaring. Will be back soon 
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,223,I can see how a lot people review this restaurant as great   love this place   fantastic   etc. .. but like to review restaurants based on how the food is prepared  and how it tastes.  I  would like to give a lot of the restaurants a 4 to 5 rating but that s hard to do.  I m sure that other plates are hopefully better than the  Machado Plate I had  the eggs were over cooked to the point of tasting very dry. I  hope they were not leftovers from earlier that morning but they sure tasted like.  Scrambled Eggs do not need to be cooked like meat items   you can turn off your burner 1 2 way into the cooking and let the residual heat from the pan complete the cooking   carry over cooking .  Please watch your cooking no  need to go over bored.  Sorry but as a personal chef I will critique your cooking skill and knowledge.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,224,I m always amazed at how fresh the food is   and how fast it comes out. It s a bit unassuming as far as location  and it may be hard to find if you haven t been there  but it is definitely a great place to eat 
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,225,I was a little disappointed at the food at this location.  It was good  just not as good as it was the first time I had it at the Bee caves location.  I ll try something else next time or I ll go back to Bee Caves.  The person taking our order had some problems understanding what we wanted  which always has me a little concerned.  The music they were piping was Nortena  I m okay with listening to music in Spanish  but I don t think Nortena fits with the Zuzu atmosphere.  Also  I don t know if it was the wet weather  but the floor in here the day I was there was really slick.  I almost slipped a couple of times.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,226,The service was really good. Honestly  I think this is probably not the place for us but is really a family place  seemed geared for folks with kids in tow . Put it this way  I have never before in my life seen green peas and diced carrots in Mexican rice. I am not a Mexican rice expert -- maybe I just haven t had real Mexican rice before. It just kind of threw me. The portions were small for what we paid -- we were still hungry after we ate. The flavor of the sauces on both of our dishes was actually pretty good. On the other hand  the roasted potatoes on the side were pretty bland. Black bean puree pretty good  tortillas just OK. Meat was overcooked. Definitely not worth it for the money for us.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,227,I was a regular patron of this restaurant for several years.  But two months ago I ordered a grilled vegetarian burrito.  What arrived was a white flour tortilla with very little filling.  It was saturated in some kind of foul tasting oil...far from the healthy meal I was expecting.  I wrote to Zuzu twice about this  hoping it was just a fluke and was ignored both times.   That gives me the impression they are covering something up  so I haven t been back since and won t be returning.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,228,The food is a cut above  fast food  mexican. The potatoes are a bit greasy but they can be avoided  or drained . The salads are great and the specials and variety. Our kids love the food  which is healthier than many other choices. We go back every week or so and haven t gotten tired of it. Friendly staff also.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,229,The mango iced tea was great but I was expecting a lot more from a restaurant that describes itself as  handmade Mexican food .  The egg and potato breakfast tacos which are usually a no brainer for anyone who makes Mexican food were worse than awful. I left them on the plate. Taco Express is an absolute winner. I ll never go back to Zuzu.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,230,Neat place that s hard to find.  We are fans of the tacos  beans  rice  and salsa bar   The enchalidas were pretty good too.  The variety of sodas was the most interesting we ve ever seen   Cool   The price was good too so we recommend it.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,231,Last 2 times I was there  2 years ago  they messed up both of my take out orders.  I didn t want to go back.  Two years later  when a Groupon appeared  I thought I d give them a try again.  Once again  they messed up my take out order.  I saw them make the order  then deliver food to people that came in behind me  and then ALL stand around talking while I waited on my food.  Finally  I asked about it.  It was ready  bagged  they just forgot to give it to me  not the first time this has happened .  I asked did it include silverware   Yes.   But wasn t really sure the guy that answered really spoke English.  Asked the cashier  she said   Yes.   Got out to the car  checked my order  which I ve learned I HAVE to do with take out from ZuZu s   and there was no silverware.  Had to go back in for it.  Bottom line  they really stink at doing a complete job on take out items.  Dining in is better.  Shame  because the food is good.  It s even worse when they give me the wrong food and I have to wait around all over again for them to make  AND GIVE ME  the right food   Alas.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,232,Reviewing just take-out.  I have had lunch from here a bunch of times via free lunch at work perk.  I m usually looking for a healthier option  so I usually end up getting the cilantro-chile chicken.  The chicken is kinda dry but the sauce makes up for it.  Granted I get no cheese so that would help too.  I love the cilantro-chile sauce    Rice comes under the chicken.  I ve gotten it as a side too.  It s always moist and flavorful.  I like the black beans.  The charro beans are good too  but I m not too thrilled about the bacon in it.  The beans come in their own little mini taco shell containers.  Fancy way of serving it but all soggy when it gets delivered to us.  I have had the corn relish  grilled veggies  and potatoes as sides before as well.  I remember them being really good except one of the sides being very spicy... can t remember which.  Overall  I do like their food.  I d give it a 3.5 stars if I could.  However  it is not a place I think of going to on my own outside of work.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,233,My husband and I ate here last weekend and will never return.  After waiting over five minutes at the counter for the staff to stop staring at us and come over and take our order  we finally got some service.  We asked the man working the cash register for some recommendations and he didn t have any suggestions.  My husband ordered a burrito that was the owners favorite  and it was a mixture between bland and crunchy  due to the tortilla strips inside of the burrito .  I had fish tacos  that came with stale tortillas  flavorless fish  and cabbage.  The sauce they served on the side wasn t bad though  although my husband co-opted it to make his burrito palpable.  Too bad  we just moved to the neighborhood and were looking for a new place to eat.  This will not be it.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,234,The food is fine. Not great  not bad  but the guy who takes orders at the counter is a jerk. I don t expect great service from a restaurant where you place your order at the counter  but I do expect not to have to fight with them over getting kids meals free  as is advertised on their website Monday- Wednesday after 5 30pm .  The first time we went here we had 5 adults and 2 kids. It was on a Wednesday night  and kids meals are supposed to be free with each adult platter purchase. After ordering and paying we looked at the ticket and noticed we were charged for the kids meals. When I went to talk to the guy about it he tried to tell me he had not charged us for the kids meals. I don t know what kind of idiot he took me for  but I could clearly see that the kids meals were paid for. After going back and forth with him a couple of times I finally got my phone out and added it all up in front of him. Sure enough we were charged for the meals. Rather than give us back cash he offered to give us vouchers. I said that was fine  and thought it kind that he gave us vouchers worth  10 for around  6 worth of food.   At that point I didn t really want to ever eat there again  but about a month later we decided to try it again and use the vouchers. It was again a Wednesday night. Again we had 5 adults and 2 kids. After I placed my order and my two kids  orders and the rest of our party was about to order  I asked about kids meals being free  he said yes  but they have to be on separate tickets. I said fine  take one of the kids meals off the ticket and I ll pay for my order and get one kids meal free. He took one kids meal off  but tried to charge me for the other kids meal. When I questioned this  he finally took the price of the kids meal off. So my husband placed his order and the other kids meal order plus one other adult order. The other two in our party were about to order and pay when the guy said they could not pay for the food and get the kids meal free because the kid was not theirs. WHAT  Why does it matter who the kid belongs to   Anyway  my husband paid for the food that was already ordered  kids meal free  and the other two in our party placed their order.  Now  some may think me a cheapskate  but I don t think it isn t a huge deal to have to pay  6 for two kids to eat. I just don t think we should have to fight just to get an advertised deal. If they don t want kids meals to be free  they shouldn t offer the deal on their website. It is crazy. I will not go back to this place just because the service is so AWFUL 
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,235,I decided to take myself out the day before my birthday  and yes I could have chosen a nicer place but I have given up trying all the terribly complicated and greasy mexican food in town and I wanted something fresh and healthier. I have the cheese enchiladas and  they were perfect and I didn t walk out feeling like I needed a crane to pick me up.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,236,I ve been going to ZuZu since it opened.  I love their food  but some dishes are better than others.  Love their migas  chimichangas  salads  soup  roasted chicken and of course  mahi mahi tacos.  Their food is always fresh and they have a nice salsa bar and great iced tea.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,237,Best basic Mexican food in town. Super good food for very reasonable prices.  Love the salsa bar
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,238,The food and the service were bad.  With only 4 customers  they couldn t make taco plates as listed on their menu.  Left cheese  avocado  and real grilled shrimp out of the Shrimp Tacos.  It was a fake shrimp mixture in tortillas for  8.25.  3 of the 4 employees were sitting down eating  and socializing.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,239,BEST fresh and healthy Mexican food in Austin   This is definitely an Austin favorite.  Their mahi-mahi tacos are great and full of flavor 
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,240,On 9 24 2013 at 12 30pm we bought a chicken salad to go.  When we got home we found a roofing nail in the salad.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,241,I can t imagine anyone having any service or food issues at ZuZu. I have been eating here for years and have never once had any concerns. In fact  I have been there for many lunches and the amount of people I see coming to this restaurant tells me they must be doing something well. I think it is the food  salsa bar and Mango ice tea. Yes  they can be busy but the food comes out quick and fresh and the there are always clean tables to sit. I recommend the Spinach Chicken Salad and Mango Tea  wow  what a meal  Kids all love the frozen lime drinks and who can pass up all the fresh stuff at the salsa bar.  Yummy   For those that want to fuss about this restaurant have not given ZuZu a chance to show you why some many people eat there every day. Cudos to the owner  You obviously have many fans  Keep doing what you are doing.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,242,Me and my very picky wife love breakfast tacos. She always orders egg whites and they make her tacos exactly like she likes them. The bacon is crisp. I mean the crispiest bacon you ever had in a breakfast taco. There potato is so good. So good.... Anyway  this place has incredible breakfast tacos. There Chirizo is also incredible  Also very crispy little charizo crumbles. I m obsessed with this place. And the green salsa is one of the main reasons this place stands out against other breakfast taco places. LOVE LOVE LOVE this place. Been there for lunch too. Great food. Enjoyed the whole chicken. Fed me twice  Great place incredible value for what you get.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,243,My boyfriend bought a groupon for this place and so we went to try it today. Let s just say we were glad we had a groupon  I dont think we ll be back here again. He got the shrimp taco plate and I had the blackened catfish taco plate and it came with two sides and two  drinks. For sides  I had the corn relish and a salad and my bf had roasted veggies and potatoes.  The shrimp in my bfs taco were so small he literally said  Where s the srhimp.  Everything seemed to be covered in oil...hopefully it was olive oil. The  corn salsa  tasted like canned corn with no seasoning  doesn t  salsa  mean something more  . The salad was literally lettuce and three square bits of tomato...no dressing and flavorless. My blackened catfish tacos were so bland as well that I just piled everything into it to give it more flavor. I added the corn relish  pico de gallo  salsa  and jalepenos and it was way better. This was a big disappointment. This is not  handmade Mexican food  unless you like opening cans.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,244,lunch was pretty good  will go back and try the breakfast tacos to make a final decision.  would have been 4 stars but my steak burrito had chewy overcooked steak.  but the flavors were very good 
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,245,I ve been to Zuzus in other cities and those were much better than this location. Everything was tasteless- watery salsas  blandly seasoned meats  etc. What a disappointment 
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,246,Finally went to this place. OK  decent enough food. Not what I want expect from Mexican food  but not bad. I d only go there again if I had some sort of gift certificate or discount.  Otherwise  I d choose other Mexican food places.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,247,Kinda bland.  Not really Tex Mex or Interior Mex.  Maybe Cali Mex 
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,248,I have only ordered a few things from ZuZu s in my life. In the mid 90s  one opened in West Houston around the block from where I went to school. Several times a week my Mom would get ZuZu s for dinner  and I always got the tortilla soup. Their tortilla soup is so different than most- it s thick and creamy rather than traditional broth based tortilla soup. It has a tomato-paste taste that has just stuck with me for years. The always two strips of clean  grilled chicken strips and all the right spices. The one in Houston closed and when I first started making road trips to Austin when I was 18  and still almost a decade later I always got ZuZu s tortilla soup to go- several containers  and freeze them for later.  I m serious  it s like pre-teen nostalgia for me. I can t say a lot about the rest of the menu.... but this is still my favorite tortilla soup  ever  and I m glad that they re still in Austin.  To top all that nerdiness off- I hope that someday I ll get the recipe.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,249,I love the food here  The beans and the quesadillas are amazing  However  the reason for only four stars is that the wait service isn t that friendly and the atmosphere is lacking. Also  it could be a bit cleaner. So  to recap  food   amazing  but service  atmosphere  and cleanliness   ok.
Zuzu Handmade Mexican Food,250,Great spot   Family owned with fresh mexican food.  My favorite breakfast tacos in town.  The Owner stopped by table to chat...one of the most friendly people I ve ever met.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,1,Visiting Californians  amp  we loveeee Micheladas  the drink .  This place had a great  famous Michelada  and even better brisket. The service was stellar  amp  the ambiance was perfect.  Love the atmosphere - would definitely go back
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,2,Okay y all  This place is amazing  We belong to a group that meets every 2nd Sunday of the month and this was our first visit to Micheladas. We had more people attend than we had thought but the team here was on target. The owner was so generous and accommodating and she organized the wonderful team to help us. The drinks were perfect and the service was 5 star. We were impressed by the service and quality of the food. I had the spicy margarita and shared the TexMex nachos  So happy with everything and everybody that helped make this 2nd Sunday a success. Incredible place we will be visiting again  Wow  Amazing y all 
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,3,I visited this restaurant while in town for business. It was a great choice  The food was excellent and so was the customer service. I highly recommend if you re looking for great Mexican food 
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,4,Came here for lunch and the service was good and fast. I tried the tacos derados and it didn t disappoint. The salsa was kind of bland but the chips were good.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,5,Came in later in the evening  sat outside in their outdoor terrace. Food was great and they had margarita flights which were tasty  Our waiter was super nice and attentive  had a table of 5.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,6,Hidden gem located in downtown  indoor seating outdoor seating with a bar showcasing all sports. Good food not that pricey. Drinks are good and so is the food
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,7,Upon arrival  the restaurant smells like mildew. The waiter was nice on the phone when I ordered three breakfast tacos. However  I experienced horrible customer service when I was in the restaurant. My tacos were in a bag. The bag was full of grease. I opened the breakfast tacos and I saw nothing  but grease. I decided not to eat the greasy tacos and gave them back to the waiter. The waiter was extremely rude  I asked him for help ordering something else and he kept telling me  one moment.  I asked the other waiters for assistance and I kept getting blowed off. I decided to leave. I am so disgusted because I was looking forward to trying this restaurant. I will not be back 
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,8,Place is big and beautiful as well as service. Sadly the food is not the best  in fact  pretty bad  - Tacos were plain  no flavor  no sauce or at least lemon lime juice.  - Super basic quesadilla and poor quality chicken.  - Guacamole was too salty.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,9,Will this become my favorite tex-mex spot  Probably not  but they did everything satisfactorily  so they deserve 5 stars. It started out as what looked like a quiet grey Thursday night  but as soon as I sat down two tour buses unloaded across the street and a huge group descended on the patio. Based on this and past reviews I lost all hope of fast service. However  the servers kept up alright. With my Yelp check-in I redeemed free queso. It was just ok  a little too spicy. For my main course I got the Taco Salad and substituted bell peppers instead of meat. I m glad they made this special modification even though it wasn t on the menu  It was generous and delicious  They ve got a happy diner here 
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,10,Margs were really good  service was horrible. I had ordered a flauta plate and strawberry marg  amp  only received my marg. Waited a couple minutes just in case and then had asked waiter about meal and he said  he forgot.  It wasn t even  rush hour . Greasy floors  when tried to wave down waiter was ignored  amp  we live in Austin area and are right across the street for a volleyball tournament  you would think they would be more hospitable with incoming crowds. Will definitely not be back at this facility 
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,11,Viva Tex-Mex   I really enjoyed this Cafe y Cantina  We came in here for a brunch  and left full and happy  We were instantly seated in front of a fountain that featured a statue of a drooling bull who filled an overflowing chalice. Scenic  There s televisions on the bar- three big screens so you re sure to be able to catch the game while keeping an eye on the other game and that episode of Golden Girls while you re at it.  The bathrooms were all individual little rooms around a communal sink  which is always a cool concept that you don t see too often in Texas. The furniture all looked like it had been brought over the border- it was roughly carved wooden statues and giant pots. Things that you see at the mercados on the border.  The food was wonderful  I got the chilequiles  which were served norteno style  with three different types of cheese  scrambled eggs  with a chipotle smoked salsa mixed in  and a tomatillo and jalapeno green sauce on the top. The chips were neslted in with a ranchero sauce  bringing together a variety of textures- the creaminess of the cheese  the fluffiness of the eggs  and the crunchiness of the tortilla chips.  The service was fantastic- they kept coming around to make sure we were happy and the food was to our liking. Prices were decent for a brunch crowd. We didn t opt for their delicious-looking drinks  but they have a full drink menu and a full bar.  We didn t get to sit out on the patio  they weren t offering service out there due to the high winds.  I ll head back here again 
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,12,Received the most horrendous service at this business  Also  was charged an additional  14.00 for ordering an item from the child s menu with no prior notification. such a rip off... Spoke with manager who was very rude. Called the number on the receipt 512-320-0300 to speak with the owner  and  the message states the number is not in service.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,13,Unique authentic Mexican food in Austin downtown   the watermelon salad is the best    
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,14,Came here the night before the Austin 1 2 Marathon and while the service was great  the good was mediocre.   We were a large group- 7 adults and 2 kids  only 2 households   everyone is vaccinated  don t come at me   Our server was very attentive and ensured our water cups remained filled and our chips  amp  salsa were never empty. As for our entrees  they all left something to be desired.   Check in on Yelp for free queso 
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,15,5 stars for service. Our server was kind  attentive  and our drinks and food arrived in good time. We appreciated the pepitas in the ceviche  but our fajitas were under-seasoned and required salt and pepper to add flavor. The outdoor space is cool though  with a tall roof and a Big Ass Fan that has definitely earned its name.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,16,Good food and drinks but place was very crowded. Seats were back to back to the person behind each other. Drinks are small sizes for the prices.  6 bottled beers and  4 mexican cokes. But it is downtown so prices are expected to be higher. Ribeyes we re super good  Wish I had more garlic potatoes with my order though bc they were BOMB 
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,17,Amazing atmosphere for outside dinning and good location. Drinks and appetizers are all we had and they were delicious. I don t think many will be disappointed.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,18,We ordered nachos  FYI served on tostada shells  that were average. We also ordered two presidentes that were decent. The staffing and waitress  were a little hectic and was a bit difficult to order. Overall was average.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,19,Horrible hospitality for a city that is our State s Capitol  amp  hosts families from all over  Hostess was extremely rude  even the manager. When you have thousands of families visiting for a volleyball tournament  you would especially like to appreciate  amp  be more than hospitable to the amount of potential revenue your business could profit from. Not the exact opposite. Zero tolerance for such abuse 
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,20,We had such a great time here  the owner was attentive and spoke to many tables ensuring satisfaction. We will definitely be going back  it was delicious and a good atmosphere  plus it is right by 6th street.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,21,Was in town for work and this place is right across from the convention center   Amazing food   I didn t take pictures but know the chili con queso is bomb and the seafood enchiladas is amazing   Service is a bit slow but definitely nothing horrible   I ll definitely hit this place up again 
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,22,Atmosphere was nice  Nice location  did not eat any food  but they had some great mimosas 
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,23,Very good food  drinks  and service  handled our large party well. A little expensive for Mexican food  especially when there are Mexican food trucks everywhere in Austin where the food is just as good and much cheaper. Maybe best for celebrations or special occasions 
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,24,I really want to like this place. It s got a nice ambiance  a good location  and the food and drinks are pretty good. So why could I possibly not like it  you ask  Well  the service has just been bad. Every time. And I ve been there a handful of times.   It s almost like they don t really want to succeed as a restaurant. Long wait times to be seated  when they have plenty of open tables   long wait times to order  slow response time on refilling drinks  etc. Also  I frequently get the feeling I m imposing on them just by being there--Especially the people manning the host stand. All in all  I don t think I ll ever go back here just because I hate giving my business to establishments with poor service.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,25,Had the carne guisada. It was good  but for the price I expected better. The beans weren t very good and tortillas a bit dry. We never saw our server. I did get the churros and I liked those a lot.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,26,Was looking for a spot to fill the hangry feeling I was having. Went downtown snd found this place. This place has some great food snd the service was super good. Will be back when in Austin
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,27,Margaritas we re good and food wasn t too bad. The staff is a little slow to greet me  both times I came this weekend...  I would return if at the convention center again but just out of convenience but I won t go out of my way to dine here.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,28,You have to cut restaurants some slack now  because they are short-handed.  We arrived on a Saturday for lunch  and there were several large parties on the patio celebrating birthdays and drinking shots.  So  we were patience  and the server did a good job trying to be everywhere at once.  The patio is very nice  and the Tex-Mex brunch items were delicious.  The queso was nice and thick with chilies.  Next time  I ll try a margarita.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,29,First time visiting and the food was awesome. A little loud but worth the trip. I recommend the tortilla soup 
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,30,DO NOT go here I repeat STAY AWAY  The building looks really cool from the outside but that totally changes once inside  The atmosphere is dead  like non existent  It s so quite and with all the wood and giant pieces of furniture it s like walking into a church   The staff have no energy just zombies walking around aimlessly     They can t make a decent margarita  it s all sour mix    The food  OMG  I got the shredded chicken tacos.  If you really want tacos go to Taco Bell   The chicken  at least I think it was chicken  was GRAY   I think I was dark meat  and shredded it was not    Huge chucks on the tacos  Took one bite and had to spit it out in a napkin I almost Vomited 
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,31,Visiting Austin and stumbled upon this beautiful restaurant. They have ample seating both inside and outside. I chose to start with a Prickly pear margarita. It was garnished with a blackberry and strawberry. The rim had chili powder. Delicious. The house made salsa was served with warm tortilla chips. When I asked the charming waitress about lunch recommendations  she suggested seafood stuffed avacado. It was outstanding. I will describe it as follows...1 2 of an avacado stuffed generously with large pieces of shrimp  crab and cheese. That was breaded lightly and deep fried. It was served on a nice white sauce with cheese. On top of it was a large shrimp. It was accompanied by rice and your choice of beans. Every bite was delicious.. We also ordered a chicken taco salad. Lettuce was fresh and a huge portion of chicken was provided. I would highly recommend this awesome restaurant.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,32,I was craving Mexican  so I found this Mexican spot around the corner from my hotel in downtown Austin. And let me tell you......Food is DELICIOUS     Ordered  the bacon wrapped shrimp stuffed with cheese and a jalape os.....sooooo good and cooked perfect    It s served with a delicious spicy jalape o sauce that is amazing. Also ordered the grilled chicken enchiladas....were soo good and chicken was excellent   I had to order the shrimp fajitas and again I wasn t disappointed. Large shrimp cooked to perfection with well done onions. Living in Cali  I m used to AMAZING Mexican food and this place delivered and made me fell like I was home.   On another note  they have in place all the Covid-19 safety measures and you must wear a mask for service.   The staff is so attentive and friendly with great customer service.   The outside patio is amazing  with sans lounge furniture in a great ambience.   Highly recommend this Mexican restaurant for great food  amazing service and a awesome atmosphere.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,33,Visiting Austin for a conference this is next to the convention center and I love Mexican  so a no-brainer. It is a super huge restaurant on two levels with a lot of outside seating. When I walked in at lunchtime I  was a bit nervous because there were only two people at the bar. But other people came later.  Usual menu items offered. I got the chicken fajita taco salad. It was fair  nothing to write home about. The chips were warm  fresh and yummy. The salsa was on the hot side  I don t do hot .  This place is clean but seems a bit old and in need of serious updating  at least the chairs and bench covers. They are all cushiony  but the  pleather  is all worn off and horrible looking.   Super fast service  ok food. I d come back.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,34,Food is decent. The corn and poblano crab dip and tacos dorados were our favorite appetizers. The suiza enchiladas weren t bad either. However  with good Mexican food you want good strong drinks...but our group wasn t satisfied with the margaritas and Mexican martinis. Couldn t even taste the alcohol  which is a bit disappointing for the price of the drinks.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,35,I ll agree with a former reviewer that this place either changed management or turned around somehow. We had brunch and it was fantastic. The Mexican Benedict is great. I would definitely recommend this place.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,36,My husband and I came here for a Friday night dinner. It was very disappointing. The chips are fried in a rancid oil  you could taste it. I ordered the chicken fajita salad  it was bland and boring. My husband had the chicken enchilada plate and it was the same  bland and boring. We were hoping for some great flavors and were strongly disappointed. We will not be returning.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,37,I would give 3.5 I would.   No one greeted at the door  so we had to kind of make our own way in. The hostesses were sitting at the bar talking to the bartender.  -1    The chips tasted weird and burnt almost. They had minimal salt. The salsa was the only thing that kept me eating them.   -1    Our waiter was pretty attentive and we got our drinks promptly.    .5    I got the Margarita Flight   12  it includes original  strawberry  mango and prickly pear. They were all lacking in flavor except for the mango  barely   -1   For the entree I ordered Georgies tacos  they had a nice flavor with the meat and the peppers were oh so nice.   1    Grand Total  3.5    Might return but it s not a must.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,38,Server was great and the food was great but the MANAGER WAS THE WORST     5 adults and 1 child - we place order.  Took awhile but we weren t in a hurry so no biggie.  Order finally comes and the server gets hit by another employee dropping this huge tray of food within inches of the child.  Pieces of food and broken dishes hit her and she scared and crying.   Server apologized but MANAGER NEVER CAME OVER TO APOLOGIZE.  Waiting for our new order took forever to come.  Was not made a priority - we were now behind other customers that came in. Then it comes in pieces.......2 meals come  about 5 minutes later  another meal comes and then about 5 minutes later  the 4th meal comes.......everyone is eating and I am still without my meal.  MANAGER NEVER CAME OVER TO APOLOGIZE.  About 10 minutes in I catch my server s attention and he tells me that another server took my meal thinking it was one of his orders.  About 10 minutes later  I tell my server to forget the meal but at the same time I am telling him  my meal finally comes.  Everyone in my party was done eating and we had already been sitting over 2 hours so I told my server that I didn t want the meal.  From this point on  we never saw our server again - he was embarrassed with it all and so our water glasses never got refilled  we were not offered dessert  etc.  Finally another server came over and asked if we needed anything and explained that our server didn t want to come back to the table - REALLY       Due to everything that had happened  I figured they would comp some of the meal but the bill came and nothing.  I went to speak to the manager and have never been treated like this.  He basically told me dropping a tray is an accident and he didn t feel he owed an apology for it.  WOW    When reiterated that food and pieces of broken dishes hit the child  he still didn t apologize.  WOW    When reminded him that I never got a meal because another server gave my meal to someone else  he still didn t apologize.  WOW    When I said our meals  my late meal all should have been a priority to make and give to us  again  he didn t care  people who came in after us were served before our orders were remade.  WOW      I asked for some type of comp to compensate for all that happened and the manager  who refused to give me his name  again was nasty in his response and stated he owed us nothing.  He said we ate the food so he owed us nothing.  My daughter even spoke to the manager about the food and broken dishes hitting her child and all she asked for  from him  was an apology and he wasn t willing to do that.  WOW    That s great customer service    My daughter had worked for a chain restaurant and said his reactions  attitude and actions were unacceptable.    I will say the service and the food was great but the Manager made the experience the worst   All he needed to do was to come to the table  apologize and compensate in someway to make his customers happy and he did nothing.  If this manager speaks to other customers like this  the restaurant will go down the tubes.    I told him I will write a review and his response was  go ahead  I don t care  - WOW    
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,39,Wow  Due to weather  most places were closed  so we finally found an open place and didn t have any high expectations for brunch from a Cantina... but boy  were we wrong... all four dishes were amazing from American more alike cuisine like biscuits and gravy  and Americano breakfast  to Migas Enchiladas and Mexican style Eggs benedict.  The venue however was too cold  but I guess Austin s buildings are not meant for below freezing temperatures.  Our waiter was phenomenal. He s a keeper 
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,40,Yum  Good chips and salsa to start  Fajitas were tasty  good steak  nice portions... house margarita was just ok  smallish  weak
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,41,I had the nachos and my wife had the chicken flautas. Both were really good. The service was great. Would definitely be back again.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,42,First time here. Disappointed to walk into a Mexican restaurant with no chips. Can t order brunch when we re within the brunch time limit. I understand maybe short staffed but to run out of chips and breakfast items on a weekend 
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,43,Was looking for a cool  comfortable place with good Mexican breakfast food.  I was pleased to come upon this place.  I ordered the Mexican Benedict with chorizo and eggs sunny side up. I also ordered a side of Waffles.  Both delicious and came out very fast.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,44,Did Saturday brunch.  Brunch burger breakfast tacos sopapilla waffles were all outstanding   Service was great.  Cocktails hit the spot.  We will be coming back for sure.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,45,Beef fajitas  were delicious - service a little slow  but wait staff were nice.  The portobello fajitas were not that great and the margaritas were very small.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,46,If I could give this place 0 stars I would.  If you appreciate good service this place is not for you and the owner doesn t care if her service is bad. She knows that being in a location across from the convention center guarantees business no matter how crappy the service.  And the food is definitely not worth the wait. We had a reservation for 12 00 and had to wait and then was told their was no brunch available this weekend. We had 11 people which included two kids and waited over 30 minutes to order and that was after we asked to order. At 2 00 we finally got our food and that was after talking to the owner.  She had said some of the ticket would be comped and then she said we misunderstood.  If you are a local like us and have a choice stay away. They do not want your business.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,47,Lots of recommendations from the people in Austin. Was wary of the 3 star rating  but they may have had a switch in management in ownership because it is much higher than 3 stars.  Service  Pretty good  middle of the road. Since we speak Spanish  the staff were much friendlier and helpful since they struggled in English. One DIDNT even speak English. Yikes.. Also  their bathroom locks are not super functional so one of us had the door opened on because they don t seem to work well. Beautifully styled though..  Ambiance  Very empty inside and outside which is a shame because it is pretty on the patio and it was cool to be apart of the city. Very peaceful.   Food I liked my fajita meat enchiladas. Their beans were very tasty because they were very spicy   We love that. Wish they had a bean dip.... chips and salsa were excellent as well. Hot and tasty  Parents enjoyed their fajitas and their chimichanga. All the food was very yummy and filling. Perfect portions.   Good  solid sit down Mexican restaurant in the middle of the downtown. Not many Mexican restaurants nearby so this is a great option.   Passes the California test. We enjoyed it. It is much better than the poor reviews. Recommended.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,48,This was one weird experience. We stopped by for a bloddy as it s a bloddy Mary Sunday kind of day. I m not inferring that s it weird to have Bloodies on Sunday at all.  We were seated at the end of the bar and had a fan blowing air right at us. This was not a gentle breeze. I asked to move and our bar tender suggested that she would turn off the fan. Not wanting to inconvenience others I suggested that we just move to a high top.   Our drinks arrived sans straws. Politely asked for straws and was informed by our bartender that she doesn t serve straws. WTF     Scanning the bar I noticed others had straws. Well she noticed my observations and stopped by to say there are indeed straws in the back and would we like 2... ummm sure..  Well I wish our straws magically morphed our Bloodies into a good cocktail but that was not the case. These were without a doubt the worse Bloody Mary s I ve ever had. You could do better with bottom shelf vodka  V8  and Tabasco.    One star rightly deserved...
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,49,One our favorite spots  The food and the drinks are always on point  We love the atmosphere and their patio 
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,50,They are proud of their rudeness  I have never experienced such horrible treatment from a restaurant before 
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,51,Didnt even sit down to eat. The hostess looked me and my friends up and down and rolled her eyes at us and was rude. Immediately walked out  don t even want to try it anymore.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,52,This was a hidden gem.  Wow    The first restaurant all weekend in downtown Austin where quality and customer service were a priority.   We were a party of 12.  They had our reservation.  Our table was set when we arrived.  They kept our table full of chips salsa without having to ask.  Our drink orders were perfect...fast and all served together.   All 12 brunch plates were served hot....correct and all at the same time.  Food was fantastic   Go here   It was hands down the best food and service we had in our 4 day weekend  
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,53,My God this place is good. We had a party of 6 wait time was 2 minutes. Got there around 11 am on a Saturday. I cannot say enough about the micheladas. Along with the salsa and cheese dip you can t go wrong. The food was great. All 6 of us had different meals so we could see how it was. The list will take too long to type.  Go there and understand what I am talking about. Can t wait to get back.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,54,This place is gorgeous and has a delicious Tres leches cake dessert. We were walking back to our hotel around 11 am. We passed through a breakfast place that was selling crapes but the line was long so we decided to go to micheladas and I ordered a Tres Leche s cake and coffee. It was delicious. I m happy that I made the choice to skip the line in the other restaurant and come here for dessert and coffee. I love that our waitress was attentive and refilled my coffee more than once.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,55,I m a Mexican food snob and so entering my expectations were low. I was blown away frankly. It s not authentic Mexican cuisine but it was very good TexMex. Salsa and Chips set the tone  incredibly fresh. Appetizers of guacamole and queso did not disappoint. Our kids were happy  the margaritas were perfect. This place is on the top of our Austin list 
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,56,I stopped by today during brunch.  I was waited on my the cute waiter Moses.  He made sure I didn t need anything during my meal.   I got the chicken and waffles  michelada and chili con queso.  It was so good.  The waffles very fluffy. The jalape o syrup was good but I was thinking that it would have a bit of a bite to it and almost asked for some jalape os as I like a lil bite to my meal.   The chips.  salsa and queso are very good and would be a great start for any party.   I ll have to come back and try out there Mexican food.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,57,It was okay. The atmosphere was nice but the food was very sub-par. Disappointing for mexican.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,58,First time here FOOD  shared the roasted poblano corn crab dip as the appetizer it was lent bad I was exited to try this but it was bit bland and the chips that came out with it were the same and a bit stale. For the main course I ordered the wedge salad and asked for blue cheese as the dressing but got ranch both times. Maybe they don t carry blue cheese  Anyway I had it with chicken that wasn t cold and wasn t warm  also not sure how it was supposed to come but it was seasoned well. I wasn t a huge fan of the lettuce I was given  parts were a bit sour and dirty tasting. However it wasn t terrible but I don t think I ll order it again. Next time I ll try the taco salad. My friend had a shrimp quesadilla it looked good but she agreed it was mediocre.  DRINKS We ordered the margarita flight and wow the presentation was amazing  We shared the drinks but couldn t finish because it was very very salty and sweet. The manager was nice and took it off our bill and after we ordered a house bottles beer and I ordered a mimosa. It was good very fizzy and strong. Only 5   The atmosphere was really cool I had never been and wondered what it was like before covid  I m sure there were more options but it would be nice to hold an event here like a party or anniversary.  SERVICE service was decent  I know the employees were all doing their best and always looked busy. It was a bit hard to understand our waiter  I don t think he spoke much English but Also I m not complaint because I did go to a Mexican restaurant. Everyone was kind and it was very clean I might come back once things get back to normal
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,59,Mixed fajitas were really flavorful  fresh  and hot  The chips and salsa tasted authentic. We got a queso dip on the side  which I recommend. Strawberry margarita was a bit small but fresh as well  Awesome place and good ambience for a night out.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,60,We are staying at the Marriott and they recommended this restaurant which was right next door. The chips were good but as far as everything else it all tasted the same. Wouldn  t recommend  especially for the price.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,61,Frozen margaritas were sub par. Enchiladas were okay. If you are looking for decent and expensive food  you found the place 
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,62,Much better than previous reviews.  Great service and food.  Outstanding patios and convenient to everything downtown.  Very good salsa.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,63,Walked in with a couple of associates from a convention.  No hostess  so we walked to the bar to get a drink a what seemed to be drunk employee stopped us and said  what are you doing  I said we are going to the bar. He said  you can t just go to the bar  you have to be escorted by the hostess.  I said  there is no hostess . He lifted his hand and said  she s doing something she will be back but you have to get out  
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,64,I love the atmosphere of this restaurant. Its Spanish influence is seen throughout the restaurant decor. If you are able definitely sit on the patio.  I ordered the fish tacos with barracho beans.  While waiting for my main entree I noshed on the chips and salsa. They bring mild and spicy to the table. I prefer the spicy one  it has kind of a smoky flavor to it.  Took a while for the entrees to arrive. They were quite tasty though. I d definitely come back here if I visit Austin again.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,65,Went here thinking they were going to have coffee since in the name it says cafe and cantina figured they would have coffee options  they do have a regular kind of coffee. This place seems nice with the lights kind of dimmed. Gave them three stars since they just kept staring at me and my friend from the moment we walked in up until our table  we pretty much met the whole staff and each one kept asking if everything was good. Didn t really have much things on their menu not sure if it was cuz we went during a later time but was pretty much out of everything. Did get to try their churros which were a bit different than I was use to since they were really soft in the middle I thought they might of been undercooked but not sure if it was just a different type of churro  we re still good. Probably a good place to go for drinks only not really sure but you really aren t missing out if you decide to skip this place.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,66,First time customer here. Loved this place   Micheladas are delicious. Would recommend the migas  chilaquiles and huevos rancheros  Def coming back again 
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,67,For someone out of town and no wait time for brunch on the weekends  I highly recommend this spot   So delicious  I recommend the  Americano 
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,68,I wish I could review the food. Unfortunately we sat at the bar for 15 mins and never received any service. We couldn t even tell you if the water was cold as we never got any. We were spoken to once after we asked a server if we could get something  to drink and his response was   are you asking me if I can take your order  I m a little tied up right now. I ll take it when I get back if you still here .  Needless to say  we weren t there. And we won t go back or encourage anyone else to either. We were at the bar and There were at least 3 people behind the bar and we were never acknowledged .
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,69,Man oh man let me tell you this place was legendary. We read some of the reviews and thought   how bad can it be  . Have you ever been served the drinks that you ordered 30 minutes ago as you are walking out the front door  Oh you haven t  Well give this place a visit  How was the food and alcohol you ask  It doesn t flippen matter because you don t come here for the food.... you come here for the experience  And what an experience it was. After waiting for our drinks for a solid half hour we got them. Another 20 minutes later we got our food. Some of it was hot some of it was cold. 3 out of 8 of us didn t get their food. The waiter took their orders not once again  but twice again. But let me tell you their water game was straight fire. Water girl did a phenomenal job so God bless her and I know that one day she will run this place. Our host was also our waiter and most likely our bartender and head chef. Anyways you come to this place for the reviews  but leave this place with stories for the ages. 10 10 highly recommend 
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,70,Loved the food and the service was amazing. I highly recommend the Alhambre tacos   Best tacos ever 
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,71,I did some research as far as where to find the best micheladas in Austin and this place popped up. I m not going to lie  it was pretty underwhelming. The micheladas are not that great and there is less than half a beer in it. It is typically made with Dos XX but you can substitute with any beer of your choice.   The food  on the other hand  was authentic and pretty delicious. They do offer pretty speedy service. We got drinks right away and once we got our order in everything came out pretty quickly.   This is the second restaurant we visited in the city and once again we had a super awkward experience with the waiter. The first time he approached the table he spoke English but when he came back he was speaking in Spanish  I speak both so it s fine but I was just so confused. He kept switching it up and was super shy and quiet. Overall any interaction with him felt strange.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,72,The food is delicious  my favorite is the chorizo gravy on ANYTHING    Service and food have been amazing every time we ve gone.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,73,The only thing good here are the chips and salsa.  We had a margarita and it came in a rocks glass.  I asked the waiter what his favorite thing was and he told me a  17 shrimp.  It was disgusting. The sauce was old  probably leftover from a couple of days past.  The rice was also old and really mushy.  My S.O. had crispy beef tacos and he said the were o.k.   45 for crap. Yuck    Wish I had waited and had a chicken fajita taco from Whataburger.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,74,We came for a lunch and sat outside on the patio  which was very nice  We came during the lunch hour and it was steady  but not too busy  and were promptly seated  The service was great and very friendly  I ordered the chicken flautas which were very good. The chicken was tender and the lettuce  tomato and avocado on top was very fresh  I liked how the tortilla was crispy but not overly crispy. I was the chicken flautas down with a frozen margarita which was also delicious. Great place to sit outside and enjoy the nice weather  Pro tip  if you order an entree you get a free small queso with check in  you re welcome    
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,75,Great Mexican food.   I usually get the tortilla soup  amp  every time it s been great. I ve never had an issue with any of the servers  as they re all very attentive and make sure we are set.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,76,We went on a Sunday close to closing after leaving Zanzibar. We sat on the patio which is really nice. The staff rushed to greet us and seated us immediately. The chips and salsa are wonderful and complimentary even for refills. The salsa was spicy which I loved. In our group of 5 we ordered the vegetarian burrito  chicken burrito  chimichangas and taquitos which were all tasty. My food came out wrong but was corrected immediately and happily. I wasn t in love with the wine selection my Sauvignon Blanc tasted like Gallo or Sutter Home. Very good service. Fantastic location.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,77,I arrived late to join a party of about 15 coworkers--and the wait staff scurried to get me a drink and food quickly so I could catch up with the group.  I was impressed.  My margarita was tasty  My tacos were flavorful.  Good meal.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,78,First time in Austin. Getting friendly service everywhere and knocked out by this awesome city. This place was right next door to the Convention Center  a most fortuitous location. They have a really good and spicy michelada  and you can choose your own beer. If not for that  this might have been a one-star rating. The service was slow and on the level of pulling teeth. Good luck with that. We decided not to order food after seeing the pulseless and uninspired service  mirrored by management as we left without so much as a thank you.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,79,Patio seating very nice   service was good and staff very friendly meal was very affordable and drinks were very good
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,80,Not gonna lie..... I came here when I was already intoxicated  so any food I had  was delicious. I do recall having the smothered beef burrito... which was HUGE. More than enough for one person.   Asked the waiter what I should get for my alcoholic beverage  he said he was an alcoholic and loved to drink  but didn t have much of a suggestion for me. I went with the classic margarita. I will say that the food was served in a very timely manner  considering I was with a party of 14.   It s alright in my book. Nothing more  nothing less. Just your casual  Tex-Mex restaurant.    gopriz
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,81,If I could give zero stars I would do so.  The owner is also the Event Planner and was amazing when my fianc  and I looked at her rooftop as a reception site.  She first met us at Pecan Street Cafe and we would later learn she owns this  as well.  The venue was not nice and there were many homeless persons and we did not feel safe due to the ambience and scenery.   We met her inside to be courteous.   She took us to Micheladas and while it was not our first choice  she was so sweet and easy.  We said yes.  What followed in the next few months was horrible.  She was dishonest  refused to speak with our hired wedding planner because she informed Brenda Woody that she was asking for fees that were not industry norm  I.e. a 20 percent gravity on top of another 20 percent just for alcohol  and it ended with her calling me and asking if I was trying to start problems with my wedding planner and her.  Just like that. She was rude and vial.  She name dropped and said that she worked with Kanye and Justin.    After months we were unable to pin down a contract with her because of her antics.  I was frantic. 10 weeks left until my wedding and we could not trust her.  She did not follow through on anything that she said she would. Once she has you  she will lead you on because you feel like you need the venue.   We were shown pecan street cafe and their menu with cake prices one month before we gave her out deposit for Micheladas.  The cake was advertised on their website for 425.00.   She insisted it was over 600.00 when it came tome to pay and order.  I showed her the website.  They get all of their baked goods and pastries from pecan street since they own it. She said  oh  those Prices are outdated .   I said  from one month ago   And they re still on the website btw even now.   You showed us these prices when we met you to book the venue     It goes on and on way beyond this.  I will prove it to her or if it will help you decide on this venue.  If she responds to this  message me privately.   I have an entire paper trail to prove every single thing I am claiming about this venue and this person.   I will prove it all and gladly to help someone avoid the loss of money and stress that she caused us.  If she refunds our 1500 deposit I will also take this review down and not pursue further collection.    We never received our deposit back and in the end  it was worth walking away from 1500.00.  We were married at The Driskill Hotel and wanted something more open and laid back like a rooftop terrace for the reception.   We decided to have it at a museum in the same area and although we paid much more  we chose to do this.  That s how horrible she was.  Hope this helps.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,82,Let me just say  I love Mexican food  chicken enchiladas are my go-to. These were the best restaurant enchiladas I ve ever had.   My dad and I stopped in here on Saturday night - Selena was our server and she was so pleasant and very attentive even though  I think  she was the only server for our half of the restaurant. I ordered the chicken enchiladas  green sauce  with refried beans and it. was. phenomenal. I already knew I was going to be writing a review because the guacamole was the best restaurant guacamole I ve ever had  So I made sure to snap a picture of my food when it came - literally 10 mins later I took a picture of a clean plate. I used the warm tortilla chips they set on the table to scoop up the last of my beans because there was no way I was leaving anything on that plate. My dad had the Burrito Supreme with fajita beef and the whole time kept saying   This is so good... Holy cow this is good.    Selena checked on us multiple times and any time the manager walked by  or someone came to clear  our drinks were refilled. I was impressed with the service and blown away by the food. I already can t wait to go back 
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,83,Talk about false advertising on their Menu    It s really inconvenient to see a price online and receive a completely different one when you go in. They stated this  Google  website is not secure so why isn t it removed or updated with Google... Hello manager do your job  be professional and own your mistakes... BEWARE enter at your own Risk  very disappointing.... Don t recommend this restaurant to anyone.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,84,This place was nice not to many people inside and the waiters were nice and came to fill up our water and the food didn t take long I got the Tortilla soup which was really good  amp  there chicken and waffles were pretty good too big serving  I would get the chorizo gravy on the side.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,85,Stopped in early in the week to watch some sports  was seated at the bar and had a great experience. The service staff was attentive and the food was all prepared perfectly. Had a hard time not taking the chips and salsa to go as they had the perfect crunch and spice combo. The only reason they didn t get 5 stars is they beers that I ordered were frozen. Not the worst but less then ideal  if your looking for a nice dine in Mexican food restaurant this is the place 
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,86,This place has amazing service  Ava  the bartender  made our experience perfect. Our food was delicious  my son raved about the quesadillas. My husband and I enjoyed the margaritas on the patio. I had the flight which was a perfect sampling of 4 flavors  mango  prickly pear  strawberry and traditional lime. We also had enchiladas  which were superb.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,87,Don t sit in the bar unless you want to hear every detail of the bartenders social life  I should have sat in the dining room  but since it was just me I thought the bar was a good choice. The bartenders friend was seating at the bar and they chatted the entire time while I sat two seats down  where the hostess sat me. Not a single other customer in the bar.     I didn t want to be rude and ask to be moved.  I definitely should have  I felt awkward the whole time I was eating my fajitas  Food was good though 
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,88,The bartender didn t guide guest through the happy hour menu. Rather just gave us the most expensive option for the drink that we ordered. Charged me  12 for a Dos XX Michelada during Happy Hour. When asked why I didn t get the happy hour version  they simply said because you didn t say  happy hour   and finished up with  that s just how it is chicka.  So thanks for nothing douche bag.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,89,Found this spot that is a bit off the beaten path by locals but the service and staff are great   Any other negative reviews should be negated.  Bob Woody has this one solid 
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,90,Group of 4 hungover 20 somethings stopped in here to bring some grease and brunch to their lives. We got sat outside and were the only ones enjoying the beautiful patio. The server showed up to fill our waters and hand out menus but would disappear for long periods of time. The menu here is extensive and there is truly an option for everyone  especially for brunch. I went with the totrilla soup and the huevos rancheros. The rest of the group went for a hodge podge of tacos  nachos  and chicken and waffles. LOL at the fact that the Chicken and waffles come with a  jalapeno syrup  and when asked how spicy it was  the waiter told us thats actually a lie and he has no idea why its labeled like that. Interesting...  Margaritas here are pretty small but tasty and the food portions are massive. The huevos rancheros were basic but damn was the tortilla soup good. Fresh avacado on top and everything. This place is pretty decent but wait staff needs to not go on 20 minute hiatuses  especially when we dont have silverware or need more water.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,91,Here on a work trip. First time in Austin. Impressed so far.   Not many places can make Paloma s.  This place is by far a great one.   Definitely recommend  
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,92,Ate here while attending a conference in Austin. It was convenient for us as a lunch option. We were quickly greeted and sat when we walked in. Salsa was great. Too hot for my friends  but I loved it. Our food took a little longer than I expected. But it was really tasty. My taco were wonderful  fresh  and cooked well.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,93,The food was good but nothing special. Same goes for the drinks. The outdoor patio was probably the best part of the meal. Visited this restaurant during covid. We were social distanced from others and all staff had on masks.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,94,The michelada isn t that good.  Kinda blend.  Service sucks.  And are rude.  Restaurant wasn t busy and we waited 30 minutes to order.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,95,This review is based on their Micheladas and yelps list of best Micheladas. Best is at Buhos sports bar. It s not even in Yelps list. Secondly why name your bar Micheladas when you only offer one kind of Michelada  No shrimp   cucumber options on the rim   There s northern Mexican Micheladas  Gulf of Mexico Micheladas and southern. Step it up I really like the place and I wanna go back Update  On Friday s polvos downtown has the best Michelada by far only thing it lacks is the Tamarindo stick.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,96,Micheladas most likely relies on convention crowds to fill seats. The restaurant is usually empty.  They have good brunch deals and the salsa chips are a decent snack. Anything deep fried usually comes out too greasy compared to the dry look some places can achieve. For example  the waffles and fried chicken are just too heavy to eat on your own. The chicken soup however is actually very pleasant. Other things we ve tried are just ok but they tend to cost a few dollars more than other Mexican places.  One thing that isn t so great about Micheladas is the wait. Considering how empty it is  it s ironic that the waiters are never prompt.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,97,Came in for lunch. Glad I did not pay attention to the low average rating. The food was excellent  in fact they mad a dish for me not on the menu  pollo enchilada a la crema  It was outstanding. The Staff was friendly  service great even at full capacity. Prices reasonable.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,98,Stopped by yesterday with my G F for lunch and picked up six tacos  3 chicken  amp  3 beef fajitas for about  35.00 and it worst I ever had. This was my first  time and I m sad to say  possibly my last time. The beef was extremely tuff and chewy and the chicken was bland and flavorless. I was thinking it was because of the situation everyone was in and I do appreciate y all being open.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,99,We had brunch today and my bf said  this might be the best food I ve ever had  it was pretty freakin good  I had a Michelada and migas with extras and ate every last bite  We sat near the bar and Ava took great care of us. She was very attentive and friendly. My only suggestion is since it is called Micheladas they should have a mini menu with different styles of them. But we enjoyed and will be back next time we are in Austin.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,100,WOW   Is all I had to say after leaving Micheladas . I had the snapper veracruz and it was to die for   It was so flavorful and yummy I went into  a food coma   I could not stop myself. Oh and let me not forget about the wonderful appetizer Texas quale knots the presentation was just so beautiful and the taste was even more to die for  Would definitely come back and I highly recommend  One of the best valentines dinner by far 
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,101,Terrible experience here for lunch while at a conference at the convention center. Party of two  we were sat and our orders taken. It was 12 10 and we told the server we needed to be back at the convention at 1. He assures us no problem. We order 2 watermelon salads  raw fruits  nothing cooked  and 1 beef fajita appetizer. 40 minutes later still no food  but we went ahead and paid the bill. I asked the server to pack our food to go and all he said was it wasn t his fault. More time passes and we ask to see the manager and get waved toward the front  but no one is at the host desk. Another party had been waiting to be seated and just walked out. Note- restaurant was NOT busy- lots of empty tables and staff everywhere. Server brought our food as we were walking out the door and get this- fajita was chicken instead of beef.  Terrible service  terrible restaurant. Too many other places in the area to spend your money.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,102,I m giving it a 2 because I didn t get to try the food but the service was horrid. My husband and I had wanted to grab a drink or two and we asked for a table. We were about to get seated when a service man comes rushing to us saying we can t bring food from the outside. I said that the box was leftovers and we just wanted to drink. He was unsure and said ok  like he was doing us a favor. We decided to walk out. Service is the worst  you have a restaurant bar that has almost no customers and you would think that would motivate them to keep the few new clients that stop by. Instead we got treated like we were an inconvenience to them.. so I took my money somewhere else.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,103,This appears to be a nice family style restaurant. The owner was so gracious we stumbled in 30 minutes before closing and he was nice and courteous enough to take his time allow us to order and fix our food to go. That is what I appreciate about Austin Texas hospitality. We ordered a fish taco platter that includes beans and rice and a shrimp taco platter to go. Great Texas hospitality and delicious food and this is from a person who is not into Mexican.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,104,Deplorable. We were sat at a table at 5 45 for 12. We were served margaritas  chips and salsa and at 7 05 we were asked to get up because they mistakenly sat us there and then decided they didn t want to sit us elsewhere because we didn t have a reservation. The manager was very aggressive. I don t understand this kind of treatment.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,105,Their pricing is a little silly for what they are but their fajitas are pretty good and queso is done right. They give you 2 tortillas and charge for more which is weird. They re like  1 for 40 of them at H-E-B lol so I m confused. Not the most friendly group but if I have a reason to come here I won t be too sad about it while I eat fajitas for one at  20.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,106,They put this sign outside but don t be a fool Micheladas cost  10.The manager said that if they have a convention it doesn t apply. How stupid  Then they shouldn t put the sign in the first place. It s located across the convention center. I guess happy hour never applies. Also  he was really rude  he just said  you misunderstood the sign and have a good day  the food was ok and the Micheladas were not the best I ve had.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,107,Across from convention center so there s that. Service was weird - on one hand they were overwhelming with the check ins   all good here  you guys good    Uh  yeah  but how  bout a menu   followed by  how  bout you take my order  bring my food  drop a check..    but slow as hell to deliver. Food was food  we re in Austin so the Tex-Mex needs to be strong but here it was just meh. But again  across from the convention center...
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,108,If it s busy  beware. I went with a friend for an event  so I understand it was a little busy  but the service  food and drinks were terrible.   We ordered our food and drinks before the event started because we knew it would get busy. We got our food before our drinks and didn t see our waitresses again for about 20min. We had to ask someone about our drinks. I got a paloma and my friend got a mimosa. The paloma tasted like a glass of margarita mix. I ended up having to take it back to the bar because our server never came back to our table to check on us. I went to the bar and saw that our waitresses was making drinks for the bartender. The bartender had her remake my drink and had to give her instructions on how to make it. It was still not great  but I took it anyways.   After the event started we decided to try one more easy drink  a strawberry mimosa. We got our drinks about 15min after we ordered. It tasted good  but again I think the waitress made it because the presentation was awful. I had to ask her to bring us strawberries for a strawberry mimosa. Everyone around us was getting drinks that looked amazing. Ours looked like they were thrown together.   I finally spoke with the manager  and she didn t do anything about it. She said she would send someone to check on us  but no one ever came by. The waitress finally came by so we could pay.   Oh  and the table by us had to share a fork because the same server never checked on them either.   The food was meh.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,109,I would give zero stars if possible. I literally made a yelp account to complain about this place.  Absolutely ATROCIOUS service. First of all I got a  water  cup with lipstick still on it. Fine shit happens. I used to be a waiter I get it not on you. We had call ahead for a big party  made reservations we get there they had 4 different tables for us. Covid we get it  trying to be responsible even though we called ahead saying if it was cool with the amount of people TOGETHER and was guaranteed a yes  they said no  fine maybe it wasn t possible  not what we planned  we asked and told we could but we get it  maybe the hostess didn t know. BUT EVERY THING AFTER THAT. Look i don t look like I speak Spanish but I do I was born in mexico the way they talked about us  thinking we didn t understand  was so terrible and rude. Orders were wrong  a friend is allergic to avocado she mentioned it  they said don t worry. Her food came with avocado she said I m allergic  they took it away  brought it back out  guess who got hives shortly after. It wasn t a  oh I don t like it  but a  I am allergic to it . I tried to be as understanding as possible but between the attitude  rudeness  and disregard for everything. I have never EVER in my life had such a ABSOLUTE TERRIBLE experience as this place. I would never recommend this place. Would actively tell everyone I know to skip it.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,110,Worst restaurant experience EVER  First off  if you are a restaurant next to a convention center you need to be prepared to handle volume and get people in and out quickly. We waited 45 minutes for drinks  were told it would take 50 more minutes to get our food  asked for our food to go and didn t even get all of it but had to leave. We were in the restaurant over 90 minutes and saw our waiter once. It s a good thing gratuity was included because I would have not tipped him at all and I always tip.  No apologies from the manager for anything.   Definitely not enough staff. Two servers to handle a large outdoor seating area. Awful awful awful. Everything was just awful.  If I could ve given it no stars I would.   If you are at a convention do not waste your time here.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,111,Great place  Drinks are good and food is tasty too. I like the environment and friendly staff at the bar and restaurant.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,112,Sunday brunch breakfast tacos were small and dry. My corn tortillas were hard and stale around the edges. The chorizo was little  dried  over cooked crumbles. My husband s migas were such a small portion  they looked like an appetizer.   The most uncomfortable bathroom layout in Austin  the stalls are clearly visible from the bar.   The ambiance is beautiful and the service excellent.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,113,Great service   Friendly and attentive staff   Clean restrooms.  I had lunch here while in town for a conference and arrived right after they opened the doors as I had an extended break between sessions.  Lunch menu is awesome   I had the chicken flautas and my free queso.  The queso was amazing    
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,114,Ummm.... I gave this place 2 stars to be nice..... food was pretty bad. Service was bad. Pricy for the food you did get.  We ordered the ceviche and it was cubes fish with tomato and some flower seeds.... it was creamy and very fishy. Do not order.   We also had he fajitas and they looked like they were boiled then maybe tossed on the grill for a min. Pretty bad too.   Chips and salsa were good and their micheladas were okay.  Would not go back.  I guess the empty restaurant should have been our first clue.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,115,Place looks cool and fun. Maybe if you only drink then it s ok.  Bartender on Sunday night was super slowwwww. I order a drink while looking at the menu too about 15 to get my drink and then finally put my order in.  Chips are great.  Salad is very spicy.  I got fajitas and they were ok.  I think I might have been just as satisfied if I went to taco bell. I didn t yelp this place first but seeing the low marks I understand.  I should have waited the 20 minutes for Gus s world famous fried chicken right next store.   Come with low expectations and thinks will be fine. Or get drunk and have no expectations on food and service and then it will be ok  Oh yeah I had to ask for chips and salsa also   And with Austin tap water boil in effect they made me pay for bottle water. When our hotel and most places comp it especially since the mayor is working on state of emergency and reimbursement for businesses.   That was pretty lame of them  
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,116,LEAVE ME HERE  JUST GO  SAVE YOURSELF    The ceviche is no bueno. About 3 ounces of fish for  16 and the price wasn t really the issue. The menu says citrus based  it was bland and creamy. Creamy  Yuck  I didn t like the michelada either but I must say I am very picky about my miches.   3 stars for my bartender  she was cool.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,117,3 Stars for location  amp  beautiful covered patio.  Food is fresh but seriously bland.  My husband ordered the burrito  I ordered the chicken tacos... nothing special and I was a little taken back by the bright yellow color of the cheese on top.  The best part about the meal is the tortilla chips and a Borracho beans.  Slowwwww service.  Will not be returning here... Too many other awesome restaurants in Austin
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,118,Amazing food. Great location. Friend of the owner is an amazing host. I highly suggest...
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,119,I am happy that i did not read the reviews  for i might have bypassed this kitschy little tex mex place  and i would have missed what is probably one of the best pork dishes i have ever had  ever.   My colleague and i had reservations at a place across the street  with excellent yelp reviews   but  after seeing it  decided we did not have the right shoes  or hair  or at the very least we were not cool enough. We looked across the street and both said  Margaritas l and in we went  we did cancel the other reservation  we are not cretons .   Our server recommended this pork dish  don t remember the name but it came with stuffed jalapenos and had some jam broiled on it . My colleague asked about fish tacos to which the server politely said  you can have fish tacos anywhere  this  the pork  you will probably never have anywhere but here . He shared some facts about the origins of the dish and from where the pork is sourced. The guy knew his stuff  and was as professional a server as i have ever had. The margarita selection is very good  and they serve ice cold Modela Negra fully dressed.   I ordered the dish. I ate the dish. I loved the dish. I may go back tonight.   Nothing else about the place seemed special  and in fact it is probably just a good tex mex place in Austin  but this dish  this dish made all the difference.  Just looked it up on the website   DON CHAPPO  Brined pork chop rubbed in chorizo spice with blackberry-ancho gastrique. Served with mashed potatoes  seasonal vegetables and 3 bacon wrapped stuffed Jalapenos.  Slap your momma.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,120,My company that I worked for rented out a part of the restaurant and they gave us the best service  ask for Justin M. he s the best bartender  was the friendliest and nicest staff I ve encountered. The food was amazing but the staff is what makes it s makes you feel like family 
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,121,Came here after another nearby place had decidedly terrible service. I decided to get a couple of breakfast tacos  chorizo  egg  and queso fresco. I asked the waitress if they still had coffee available  it was already past 10 30am   and she said she wasn t sure  but she said she could brew me some if I didn t mind waiting. I said of course  and I appreciated the extra effort.  The place was practically empty  very quiet and cozy. The chips and salsa were very good. I had to add some salt to the chips  but they tasted fresh  not stale   and the salsa was on the medium side. Not too mild and not too hot. I almost drowned myself in it  it was so good.   Food came out piping hot  and my tacos were delicious. I ate them all even though I was past the point of being stuffed. Our waitress accidentally charged our card incorrectly  but she fixed it no problem. I d recommend this to anyone wanting breakfast or brunch in a sort of quiet secluded corner of downtown. It s right next to the convention center.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,122,I was warned not to go to Micheladas but it s close to my residence and I like the way the bar spills out onto the outdoor patio. I also wanted to check out the rooftop patio. What a disaster to wit   STRIKE ONE  Went in and asked to see rooftop patio. Hostess said it was close  so went bar. Not only did nobody wait on me  no one would even make eye contact  so I walked out after 5 minutes.  STRIKE TWO  Came in next day and inquired about rooftop patio. Was again told it was closed.   STRIKE THREE  Again went to bar. No one waited on me. Server walked up who had a section elsewhere was ordering drinks and I asked him if he could tell me where to find a drink menu. He gave me the one on his trey and I thanked him. I decided what I wanted to order  but bartender was at other end of the bar  on his phone and or talking to co-workers making no gestures he planned on waiting on me or making eye contact. After 5 minutes  again walked out and nobody seemed to notice.  YOU RE OUT   I ll never go back  no wonder I was warned not to come here.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,123,Ok I truly dont understand some of the other reviews and am glad I did not pay attention to them. I am a Michelada coneisur so I really had to check it out. First off let me start out with the friendly host who greeted and sat us. He was very nice. our waiter was very nice as well and very helpful with helping me decide on entree. I chose the chipotle enchiladas and my friend the beef fajita nachos which were both delicious. My plate came out hot and was MMM sooo good. I also got to taste friends nachos and they were just as great.   I feel bad because I always require refills. My waiter along with the other staff were all over it. I did not have to request a refill at all. Not only did I have tea with my meal but it was now time for me to try a Michelada. OooooMmmmGggg     This absolutely was the  Sexiest  most delicious Micheladas I have ever had hands down. Trust me I have been having Micheladas since before the were popular here in the states. Used to have them when visiting in Mexico over 25 years ago. This wayyyy out beats anything I have had even back then. Having them here just the way they came out was awesome. Being that I love spicy I ordered one EXTRA spicy. was not disappointed at all    Actually I was blown away. Usually when I order extra spicy the bartender would just add extra Tabasco sauce. Not here. They infused it with Jalepeno and Serrano peppers. Whaaaaat    Why didnt I ever think of or ask for this before. It was so amazing that I had to go meet the bartender who made this Amazing Sexy Michelada. Her name is EVA and she is truly talented at what she does and can tell she puts in everything I to her drinks and just not dump things together.   If your looking for great food  great service  and the Best dang Bartender in area  you have to come to Micheladas. Don t forget to request a drink made by Eva     I came from San Antonio and have several great places to have good food and drinks but without a doubt Eva and crew blew me away. Total staff was great and I am so glad that my friend brought me here to celebrate my birthday. Had an Amazing experience and will take the hour trip down here weekly. Cant wait to come back and have my next batch of Amazing Micheladas      Thank You sooo much Eva    You are truly the  a href   redir url http 3A 2F 2FBomb.com amp s 716853a54974befb18bd2a2079d876386c9ebd876290947c699fc1e3eaccf129  rel  nofollow  target  _blank  Bomb.com  a    
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,124,We visited this restaurant in the late evening in July 2017. From the outside  it looked like a fun restaurant. Unfortunately  the furniture and decor was old and staid. The chairs literally had cracks in the upholstery. We were initially sat in a booth and there was a huge fly in the window. We called our waiter s attention to it  but he seemed unconcerned  merely swatting a towel over the table at it.   We asked to be seated elsewhere  and that ended up being okay. However  it started raining heavily while we were eating and gentleman who was presumably the owner came over to tell us that he was closing early because it cost too much to keep the kitchen open while it was raining. I have never heard of such a thing  but by that time I was more than happy to leave.   I must note that the food itself was good. We had the Michelada s sampler  but the restaurant was out of the quail that was supposed to be part of the sampler. The restaurant s solution  Extra beef nachos. The queso sauce was delicious and the crab dip clearly did have fresh crab in it.   Overall  a so-so experience outside of the food. Worth noting is that the menu says you can order a round of Coronas for the kitchen for 12. I can see how this would be a nice compliment to the kitchen  but for me  the front of house needs to do much better before I would spend extra money on that.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,125,The bar staff could be about 15 less disdainful  but their salsa is on point. The ambiance is a nice blend of casual and formal and the menu offers several options beyond the standard Texmex fair.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,126,We came here on a 75 degree Sunday afternoon in February  and had the beautiful outdoor patio to ourselves. I was shocked    The indoor space is dark  cozy  and designed to look authentically Mexican. The outdoor space is just perfect.  Okay  it could be a bit more perfect if it didn t overlook the convention center - but I m happy with a bright and cheery  nice size patio any day     The food was yummy and the service was on point. It seems like this side of downtown is never really too busy  but I love it. It s quiet and there are tons of good spots to eat and grab a drink. We ll be back for sure 
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,127,At a convention and decided to try this place.  It was a nice day and sat on the patio.  It was pleasant.  The only negative part of their patio are the huge tour buses that are idling outside the convention center.  I rather not breath in exhaust while eating.  Not the restaurant fault but something to be aware of. The patio is huge for a downtown restaurant.  I got the chicken enchiladas with rice and beans.  Good portion size.  Staff was friendly and helpful.  Food was delivered quickly.  The sangria was tasty as well.  If back in this part of town  I would eat again. Pre tip for entr e and one drink  20.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,128,Just stopped in to Micheladas while on a walk downtown. To be honest we hadn t eaten here before because it got mediocre reviews. Have to say that it was a very pleasant surprise. Patio very nice--shaded with huge fans that really worked well. Dog friendly too and they go above and beyond for the pooches. Excellent service for the humans too. Food was really good. We just had appetizers but everything we got including the salsa was delicious. Will definitely go back 
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,129,At first glance this place can look like a charming  breezy respite from the maelstrom of SXSW  but it s actually kind of a dump. The food is just...not good. I had the Eggs Benedict for brunch and it was underwhelming in every way. The eggs weren t even poached  There is literally no other reason to order Eggs Benedict than to enjoy the runny deliciousness of a perfectly poached egg.  The biscuit it came on looked like someone smashed it with a sledgehammer a few times before plopping the other ingredients on top. Totally unappetizing. And the hollandaise sauce was basically just queso dip. So not what I was expecting  and quite possibly the worst Eggs Benedict I ve ever had.   I did not enjoy the Bloody Mary at all. I m a picky bitch when it comes to Bloodies  so it might not be worth mentioning  but there you have it.   The margarita was fine. The free tortilla chips were okay. Not the best I ve had  but not  like  stale or anything.   My biggest beef is with the service. The bartender was fine  but the servers were just insufferable. It s like this place is their stage and we  the people who are just trying to spend our hard-earned money on a decent dining experience  are their plebeian audience. If you sit at the bar you will be privy to their loud ruminations on last night s debauchery. Staffers who aren t working might just pop in just to hang out and have loud conversations literally one foot away from a customer just trying to enjoy their damn  mediocre  food. If you are super  un lucky  you might even get to listen to one of the servers sing     while rolling silverware two feet from you.   Listen  I was once a server. I understand they are human beings with thoughts and feelings and personal lives. But I also know that the best dining experiences are the ones where the service is so smooth you barely notice it. The service at Michelada s is so noticeable I could not focus on anything else.   In short  food  meh. Service  hot mess
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,130,Went there for brunch before heading  out on a wine tour. Sat in the bar area and Ava our bartender and server was absolutely amazing  So friendly and nice  The breakfast migas tacos were the best I ve had  Highly recommend the restaurant and the wine tour 
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,131,Visited this place for the first time while in Austin for my bachelorette weekend for brunch on a Sunday before heading back home. I must say I wish we had one in Houston  Food was so delicious with flavor and texture. The Micheladas are  a href   redir url http 3A 2F 2Fbomb.com amp s bb4f996415a9c2f21137e27cfb68f439a48cec2652b53e9b50dd7e766dbe177e  rel  nofollow  target  _blank  bomb.com  a  We were a group of 14 and were sat right away the waiter was so nice and friendly I wish I could remember his name. I will make sure I visit this place again when in Austin  
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,132,Great drinks and the BEST Tortilla Soup I ve ever had  Sorry Mom . Staff was awesome and the location was close to our hotel. Also had the Pork Belly Tacos which were so good.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,133,Sat at the bar and had the coolest bartender. She offered ala carte everything  so I tried all the enchiladas. Beef with Chile con carne won the contest  but all were good. Atmosphere was amazing and the patio  although hot outside  was completely shaded by the upstairs patio. I never had to wait for a drink as she always asked before I was completely empty. Gave this place 5 stars because of the bartender s excellent service  but the food was also amazing. Will definitely come back again the next time I m in downtown Austin.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,134,Went to Micheladas while at a convention because I was tired after a long day of travel and didn t feel like walking further to find a different restaurant. Unfortunately  that was my mistake. My advice would be to keep walking. While the service wa good  hence the 2 stars   the food was not... it s food like this that IMO gives Mexican food a bad name.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,135,I was left speechless.  Went there to meet a group from Texas Winos  ordered two  4 tacos and asked for a water to wash it down.    2 for bottle water  she says.  I said sorry I meant glass of water.  Without hesitation it was  we don t have glass water for you   2 for bottled water only .  But I just ordered  8 worth of food...  So I walked outside w my  8 worth tacos and will likely never return to patronize.  Texas Winos should reconsider who they partner with.      edit  Tacos were good and manager reached out w an apology.  Changed from 1 star to 2.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,136,First of all let s say this experience is the worst myself and co-workers have ever had here.  We were seated quickly but unfortunately that s only one of the only positive things that occurred.   Our waiter  Barry was busy but he seemed bothered by our table from the moment we ordered our food.  When my food arrived it was wrong  when I had it sent back to be fixed  Barry came by and acted as if it was my fault that my food was wrong. Apparently my asking for my flautas to be plain wasn t clear enough.  Then as my new plate arrived  my co-worker found a hair in her food that was clearly not hers. When she told Barry this  he took her plate away. He then comes back to tell her that the kitchen is remaking her food. She has already lost her appetite so she is forms Barry  no thank you I don t want it remade.   Well Barry was less than impressed by this comment  he proceeds to walk back to the kitchen clapping loudly.   There was no apology for the hair in the food.  I do not recommend eating at this place.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,137,The salsa was only okay  but the queso is excellent   It is homemade  not Velveeta  and they put big chilies  serranos   in it.  Their barracho beans are probably the best I ve ever had - and that s saying something because I ve never had bad barracho beans   They had a nice smokey flavor.  The rice was a little above average.  It could ve used a bit more flavor  but the carrots and peas were definitely a nice touch.  The fajitas were excellent   Tender with a good smokey flavor  same as the beans  .  There was a real big lunch crowd  but service was good and the noise level was relatively low.  They seem to be a locally owned business  which I like.  I ve eaten here before and I ll definitely be back again 
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,138,My best friend and I were wandering around downtown Austin after our stint at SXSW and right outside was this restaurant. Without checking the reviews first   gasp of horror    my friend and I were hungry enough to just sit down and eat.  Right when we came in  we noticed that it wasn t as packed as it definitely should be- being RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET from the convention center. But there were still people. And no one was giving me the  get away while you can  eyes  so we barrelled through.  It wasn t horrible. The patio was cute  with umbrellas to block out the Texas sun. We were greeted- took a while  but I think they were trying to figure out what server got us in the rotation- and we promptly got our order in.  If you re looking for great food  this is not it. If you re looking for conveniently located  average  won t-give-you-the-runs food- this is your spot   We got the guacamole- which had no flavoring and was literally just mashed avocados- and the fajita beef nachos to share. The nachos were not impressive  or really very good. Just cheese  beef  beans  jalapenos. But  They weren t horrible. So  at least there s that.  They have a prickly pear margarita which was pretty good  and definitely very pretty.  Server was okay. Hostess was stand offish.  3. A-OK.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,139,This establishment will cut you off after 2 rounds of beverages just because you are not ordering enough food from them. After 2 rounds and an appetizer  we were cut off from ordering beverages until we both ordered entrees. As most places are closed  Micheladas was going to earn a majority of my business over the next three days. Now  they ve earned nothing. Well done  Micheladas. Please go to an establishment that will respect your business.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,140,This place sucks. Service is horrible especially at the bar.. Avoid coming here totally not worth it    Stay away
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,141,Visiting Micheladas for the second time this week. Excellent Mexican food with excellent customer service.. I can t say that enough.. if your like me and appreciate good service  please give this place a try. It truly deserves more stars.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,142,They will make you sick.  Beware         Asked for corn tortillas brought flour.  I did not initially realize this due to the way they were cooked.  They caused me a serious 12 hour plus Crohns flare up.  Bad service ie slow  drinks brought after the meal.  One of the worst dining experiences ever.  So if you have dietary concerns or Gluten free stay away from this place.  My friend asked for chicken taco salad.  They brought steak.    I told them no onions on the tacos.  Of course they had........onions.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,143,I don t understand why people do great reviews about this place  it s not good...why do people get happy with poor service  - it takes forever to have your food on table - waiters look confused and their attire look dirty - food is not  the best in town  as manager stated when we entered  party of 8 ...is not even close to Mexican food at all  - by the time food arrived to our table everything was warm  didn t even look fresh cooked. - server spilled drinks twice  one on table and the other on my friends chest. Then he decided that cleaning the glass with his fingers would be the best to do    - waiter didn t know what the ingredients in two of our plates were  he assumed everything so we ordered expecting one thing and getting another. - manager   Oh my... If you praise about your restaurant being the best  dress up like you own the place  Not in sandals and white shorts T-shirts. That to me speaks lots. - bathrooms are weird  I know Austin is supposed to be like so  but bathrooms need to have a main door. I need some privacy and I have the feeling that germs fly around bar  amp  restaurant with toilet rooms being that open  - there are many options in Austin close to the convention center  this one is one to avoid. It looks nice from outside but service and food has to improve LOTS 
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,144,Because I happened upon a bad experience  I d like to start with what s good about this place. The chips and salsa... yummy  I checked in with Yelp and got some free queso dip. It s a big open restaurant with a lot of seating and a great bar area. My waiter was  Andrew  and he was very nice and easy going.   Unfortunately when I walked in around 12 45  there was no one there to greet me. I even left for a few minutes and then came back because I decided nothing looked better that was also close to the convention center. The second time I walked in at the patio area hoping someone would greet me. No one did... I walked back inside the place and finally just asked the bartender if it was alright if I sat down. Someone new  a newly trained waiter who seemed nervous sat me down. I sat there for a while until I heard some mumbling about how I wasn t supposed to be sitting there. Shortly thereafter the nervous waiter came back and apologized for being new  and he didn t know I wasn t supposed to sit there... Okie doke...   I continued to sit there as no one told me where else to sit. I stopped a busy waitress and asked for a menu. She retrieved it for me and didn t seem concerned I wasn t getting service.   Finally Andrew got to me and I ordered. I got the cheese enchiladas. They were a bit funny tasting  I didn t really enjoy them.  So that s it s. That s my pathetic story. It all took about 40 minutes and my contact with a human employee was limited. I don t know what was going on at the time... But... Man did I feel like a shadow on the wall. Not a good feeling.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,145,The food was pretty good  but for the price  eh. Although I will say the beans were delicious  Go for the whole black beans. The outside patio area is very lovely.. makes up for the price 
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,146,Service was the only good thing. I ordered two tacos  which came with rice and pinto beans. The Tacos were  ok .   Their sauce  rice and beans didnt really tste like anything.  Even the coke was bad  because the water tasted really awful  tap water . My friend said his broccoli tasted like the tap water they served  which is disgusting.  The place is dusty and not comfortable  so overall  I wouldn t recommend anyone to go there.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,147,Bartender looked like he got his ass kicked night before and was very rude. Food was terrible and drinks were weak. Im here with a client and it was embarrassing how bad everything was. I do not recommend at all.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,148,Looking at the reviews  I guess I m glad we came in late on a random Tuesday night near closing time  We were immediately greeted and provided with chips and salsa  both very fresh and flavorful. Our waiter provided an awesome suggestion for a margarita and did just the trick for what we were hankering for.   We conversed for a long time and he allowed us to take our time. We finally ordered and I got the shrimp tacos with corn tortillas and a side of black beans. After a short time they came out and I was more than excited to eat at this point  albeit hunger curved by margaritas and chips. The corn tortillas were warm and the shrimp was perfectly cooked  not overdone. It was topped with a slaw of jicama  avocado salsa  and crispy tortilla strips.   Some others at our table got the stuffed pork chop and another got the pork belly quesadilla and none of us were disappointed. My favorite part though  Ending the night with the tres leches cake. OMG. Amazing and mouthwatering  so indulgent and sinful but at that point  there s no return  Hey  at least there was a few berries on the cake  so it s healthy...right  
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,149,Awesome restaurant  Had a nice dinner w my family  food  amp  service was great  Excellent atmosphere with tasty food  10 10 would recommend in Austin 
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,150,Great food and good service. I had the Pepper stuffed with chicken and the best drunken beans side dish  English interpretation . Medium price range  drink and a tip was about  20.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,151,It really doesn t make any sense how horrible the service is at this restaurant. I can t even comment on the food because after wasting 45 minutes of my life waiting for just some nachos  I decided to leave. The waitress at the bar slammed a glass of water in front of me after 15 minutes of waiting  and just shrugg d her shoulders when I said I was leaving. The only reason I went there was because it is right across the street from the convention center  and I wanted to grab some lunch quickly between conference sessions. Boy was that a huge mistake. I could have gone to the market  bought the ingredients   and made my own nachos in the time that I got NOTHING here. STAY AWAY 
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,152,Wow  This place was terrific. Great food and great service I was pleasantly surprised. My experience was at the bar where I had the fajitas and enjoyed a few drinks all the creation of the bartender Chrissy. I wasn t sure what to drink so she whipped up some of her own creations which were all delicious.   Thanks to the staff who were all very welcoming. Lots of fun times and great food. I will certainly return.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,153,I have never been to a more poorly run  unorganized restaurant. I understand it was busy and everyone seemed to arrive at once however you are directly across the convention center in downtown Austin. You should be better prepared. I m sure this wasn t the first time that s happened and it certainly won t be the last.   I ordered and food arrived quickly. Unfortunately my silverware did not. I sat there for 10 minutes trying to get someone s attention with no luck. It took the lady sitting next to me to request it when someone finally came by to get her order.   The food was nothing special. Standard tex mex. not worth returning for.   After I finished it took about 15 minutes to get my bill and then about 10 minutes to get card back.   Not worth it.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,154,Food is good but the staff is not. We ordered something very simple she charged everyone wrong even blamed the manager for just charging it and after he did the charge we couldn t fix it. So idk how much common sense they have here or what but if you come just bring cash and know what you ordered
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,155,Terrible margaritas.  They do not use fresh hand squeezed lime juice    Very avg fajitas.  Take a hard pass on this place.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,156,Our bartender here was absolutely amazing   Justin thank you for making our 1st visit unforgettable  Your drinks were fire  So delish  We will deff be back   hangten
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,157,I was in Austin for a conference and decided to stop here to grab a bite. Me and my friend enjoyed the chips and salsa. We got the free chili com queso and it is really spicy. There was not any meat inside but overall it was okay.   The margaritas were not strong. I added sangria to mine which made it a little better but my friend was highly disappointed with hers.   Would I come back. Probably not.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,158,Terrible experience  This place doesn t even deserve 1 star.  Came here with 6 people around noon on a Friday and the place was empty.  Should have known. They had a sign out front saying they could host 800 people when realistically they couldn t even handle one table.  Margaritas were all mix and no Mexican beers on tap.  Asked for the tableside guac which was on their menu and the server barked at us saying they were too busy to do it  so we ended up with a side of guac delivered normally. Then 1 person got 2 fish tacos and it took over 30 minutes  but the server wanted to close out everyones tabs. Food was cold and not tasty. Definitely do not recommend.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,159,Just spending the night here in Austin and accidentally came upon this restaurant. I had Chicken Burrito Supreme with Black Beans. Also chips and salsa. Delicious. If I m ever back in town I ll sure to stop by.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,160,This is a pretty bad restaurant as my opinion. I really think they dont cook their food really good. i think this is a bad restaurant.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,161,Food is good but the WORST SERVICE EVER. If I visit again I won t come back. Got up THREE times to get the check. And they forgot drinks and food.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,162,Our first time there today and was pleasantly surprised. A waiter sat us and was a bit abrupt but pleasant enough.  The queso was amazing with slices of jalapeno in it. I had the shredded chicken tacos and the meat was well seasoned and tender. We will definitely be back to try more of the menu.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,163,This is really average to below Mexican. Got the chicken enchiladas and they were room temperature. I suspect they are pre-plated and the cheese is later nuked on top. The waiter was friendly but the chef needs to kick it up a few notches.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,164,Horrible service    Food was ok. Waitress was slow  amp  was MIA for over 30 minutes until we flagged down the lady that serves water to go find her because we needed refills on our drinks  Then we asked for our check  amp  it took over 30 minutes to bring it. We literally had to go look for the manager  amp  ask him for our check  We are definitely not coming back here when we visit Austin again. I don t think this place will be open too long if they don t get better servers.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,165,I had lunch here 2 of the 4 days I was in Austin.  Yes  I am a bit boring. Or it could be that this really works if you re at a convention. I met up with a woman from Australia  we decided to dash across the street when classes got out. We got there before noon  got a table immediately and were eating quickly.  I had fajitas the first day which was good  not great  but good. The beans were spicy and the iced tea decent. I was so surprised that they did not carry Mexican coke   The second day I had a chicken enchilada and was nervous that the salsa verde was already applied before I received my lunch. But it was deliciously tangy  not hot spicy. I really loved that enchilada. Probably the best one I have ever had.  Nice breeze  clean and comfortable room with efficient service. Add to that great lunch deals and some superb food  if you order the chicken enchilada.   And enjoy your convention to boot 
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,166,Tried the Famous Michelada and also the El presidente margarita and they were Meh and under average. The salsa was also watery and disappointing. I see this as more of a touristy just getting out of the convention center kind of place to go.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,167,Best freaking enchiladas I ve ever had. Soooo good. And my water cup was never empty.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,168,Nice place  big  comfy chairs. We were seated right away  water and chips right off. They forgot salsa for s while  but the fresh chips were great dry  Our sever was very nice  refills came fast.   We were a party of four  fajita plate was GREAT  Pork belly tacos GREAT  Quesadilla plate real good  but it s hard to mess those up  p enchilada just so so. We all shared so everyone was happy.   Taco plate was a little small. If you re HUNGRY double down. Everything else was a very generous portion.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,169,The service is great and the food decent. Our waiter was kind and respect  but i probably won t be coming back for food. Also don t get the famous Michelada it s not worth it for nine bucks.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,170,Pros - the place is huge with plenty of seating  both indoor and outside. The food is delicious and our server was on point. Great place for a weekday lunch with no wait.  Cons - the parking  Street parking near the convention center is limited at best  be prepared to circle the block at least a few times.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,171,Thanks Ava for being awesome   We stopped in for a quick drink and Ava took excellent care of us. They had just been hit hard and she kept it fresh and was thoughtful on my drink.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,172,It s a shame that this place is in the downtown area and has good decor. Service is slow  we order a margarita and a beer the drinks came out 28 minutes later had to stop the manager to put in our food order. Waitress are not well trained seems like their hurting for experience staff. Don t waste your money here.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,173,Rude servers and slow service. It doesn t get worse than that. Unless you are there to spend a lot of money  they don t want to bother with you. We were there in the morning to wait for a tour bus and ordered a bloody Mary to share. Instant attitude from the server. Twenty minutes later  he brought the drink which was only five dollars so my husband gave him a ten. He never came back with the change  We finally caught up with him and said we wanted our change. He pulled out his wallet and there was our receipt. Aren t they supposed to turn those in   We went again that same evening when the tour bus dropped us off. We just wanted some queso and drinks. Got the same attitude from the server so we ended up walking out. Too bad. Heard the food was amazing.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,174,Went on a Saturday afternoon. Place was empty and I was skeptical of the 3 star average rating  but was pleasantly surprised. Great service  good margarita and the fish tacos were delicious  aka NOT tilapia . A tad pricey but hey it s downtown Austin.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,175,Just went to Micheladas  read previously reviews and was a little bit Leary  but we were PLEASANTLY SURPRISED. Eat in the Bar  bartender Baker was very personable  and friendly. Gave us many recommendations  for food and drink. I ordered the Alambre tacos. Very good  a little spicy but excellent. My friend had Chimichanga carnitas. She enjoyed her meal too. Would definitely recommend
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,176, These were some trash ass micheladas. That bitch tasted like white ppl spaghetti  -brandon  drinks 10 micheladas a day  is trustworthy 
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,177,How are you gonna only have 2 servers on a Saturday on ROT rally weekend at that.  Wanted to just have a nice relaxing dinner on the outside patio.. pictures were way better than in person.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,178,We were the only people in the entire restaurant and that should ve been our first warning sign. The service was great but the food was AWFUL. Also our booth was dirty. There was dust or dirt or visible chunks of something all over my seat that I had to wipe off. The margaritas were too sour and they had to remake them. The chips were literally the worst I ve ever had. I couldn t eat them. The oil must ve been old  it tasted disgusting and had a bad aftertaste. The queso was so spicy it could not be enjoyed. The tortilla soup has these giant ears of corn - with the cob still intact - like giant round pieces of corn cob you can t eat and have to dig out. Why not grill the corn then cut it off the cob and put it in the soup  Truly  how are we supposed to eat it  We had to take them out and nibble the corn off the cob. It was awkward.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,179,Staying at the convention center and stumbled upon this restaurant. No customers were present during lunch  a clue we ignored  as we were hungry and pressed for time. Server took way too long to refill our drinks  which are necessary if you dare to try their fiery house salsa. Ordered the chicken fajitas  every pepper was burnt and stuck to the cast iron. Won t be coming back  there are too many other Mexican places to try nearby.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,180,Ordered the Chicken Fried Steak with chorizo gravy    The chorizo gravy is awesome    It s very interesting with great flavor...     Sat outside and enjoyed the weather.     Since it s by the convention center I could see this as a tourist drop  but on a Sunday it was smooth sailing.  Ordered the Basil Strawberry lemonade cocktail and was really good...  I d recommend anything that gets the chorizo gravy   Great salsa and get the free queso when checking in 
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,181,Great tasting food  I had the shrimp tacos that tasted so amazingly fresh   I will definitely be retuning again for more local cuisine.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,182,7 pm on a Monday....was there 20 minutes before I got a menu and 30 minutes before I got a glass of water.  My order was never taken.  Bartender was very rude.  Said they were busy.  Will never  ever  ever go back.  Will share experience with all of my friends.  And even strangers.  End of story.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,183,The food was bland and the service was slow. The only good was the decor and friendly staff.  I wouldn t recommend this restaurant.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,184,Really good fajitas. Good portion of meat and veggies. Coconut mojito is very refreshing. Everyone is friendly and helpful.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,185,When they stop by and talk to you 30  minutes after you order to tell you that it will be about 15 more minutes  they actually mean about another 45 minutes. Poor communication is a bad thing when people are trying to make meetings. The chips and salsa were good.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,186,I only had drinks and appetizers  but the drinks were good and the pork belly quesadillas were pretty tasty 
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,187,This was a decent restaurant with pretty good food.  The waitress was attentive and kids were happy with their food.  They went out of their way to feed our very picky eater son. We sat outdoors and it was comfortable and sunny.  Nice dinner.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,188,First off  prepare for a very long wait for your food. We came during a convention and the wait would ve been expected if the place was really busy  but it wasn t. Within view  there are 5 tables open  so no excuse for the long wait. It took about 40 minutes for us to get our food after we ordered and the table behind us was told  we do the food in order so it ll be at least another 20 minutes .  Once our food finally did come  it was amazingly bland. Zero spices  zero flavor. Tasted like chicken from a can mixed with cheese from a bag. So prepare to ask for a lot of salsa and sour cream or avocado or whatever else you can find to soak your food in.   So basically  go somewhere else.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,189,Ugh this place is awful. I don t know how they are even still in business. The waiter was trying to sell us some cd he was working on and won t even leave us alone to have a conversation. The food was subpar and the drinks weren t strong. there s a reason it s always empty.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,190,The service at closing time was excellent. We were looking for a place without having to wait roo long. We could take our food to go since it closes at 9 and we came 30 before closing. Hopefully the food is as good as the service.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,191,This was a great choice for dinner. It s best to get a reservation.  Micheladas Cafe y Cantina fills up quick. I recommend the pork chop. The service and food was great.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,192,Awesome bar  Micheladas are on point and the staff is super nice  Really great music and environment too   
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,193,Took 15 minutes to get a seat at the bar  10 minutes for them to take my order  despite menu closed and eye contact   and over an hour for veggie enchiladas. Put in the wrong order which took 45 minutes and over 30 minutes for a replacement. Not a great place to grab launch while at a conference. Food meh. Large portions one of the only redeeming factors.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,194,Great shrimp tacos. Good Sangria. I love the atmosphere.  Friendly and attentive staff. And their salsa was amazing.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,195,Food was great  we had a variety  queso esperanza  jalape os rellenos  delicious    amp  some sort of dip with crab in it  I personally had the carnitas chimichanga. Very statisfied with the food. The restaurant was really busy when we went so drinks did take awhile. When we ordered a Michelada we noticed they were served in the tall glasses  we asked for them to be served in short glasses instead  our waitress told us that it wasn t possible because they only serve them in a tall glass. So once we finished our waters we poured them over into a short glass.  Aside from that random moment  the food was great  I will be stopping by again on my next Austin visit 
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,196,Stop by Micheladas after a day of kayaking. By far the best Micheladas in all of Austin. Special thanks to Eddie the manager. He greeted us  check on us without being over bearing. Great ambiance and beautiful patio Everything was Great 
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,197,Got a free drink  staff was nice but this place is completely unorganized  Didn t get our food on time  wasn t good at all  and it was cold. I don t see myself coming back here
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,198,We had a great experience for brunch here at Micheladas. Memorial Day weekend and we were sat quickly and the staff was very attentive and quick to our needs without being overly intrusive. Fresh flowers on the table  delicious drinks and food  I will be coming back to Micheladas when we re in town 
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,199,I give this one star for the fact that the service was good. My food was 45 minutes late and was incorrect. I ordered beef enchiladas and got pork instead. Even after complaining  only received 25  off bill. I would have walked out if it wasn t a crime. Very disappointed. Excuse was something to do with kitchen staff. Will never go back.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,200,We were in Austin for a convention. This restaurant was 2 blocks down from Hotel  the margarita was excellent and the food was good. We had a part of 6. We will be back
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,201,Hmmm  you would think that being across the street from the convention center  a downtown restaurant would be better equipped to handle a small lunch rush on a Monday at noon. They aren t. No one even greeted us. Several tables were seated before us  we are a table of three  even though they arrived 10 minutes AFTER we did. 40 minutes later and we are still not seated even though there are plenty of tables open and unused. I am so  extremely  thoroughly disappointed in this restaurant. I would avoid until they get it together.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,202,The food was decent. Nice atmosphere  but for lunch they offer limited seating   15 buffet  or sit out on the patio. It is 52 degrees outside  Not wanting to pay  15 or freeze outside we choose to sit at the bar....but then they left the door open leading to the patio so we froze anyway  We asked for the door to be shut  but they denied us.   Even other patrons could be heard saying   it s colder in here than outside     Little uoset and pretty cold. Probably wouldn t come back.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,203,Poor bar service. Bad drinks. Avoid the margarita Martini. Good tableside guacamole.  Stinky restaurant. Not good.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,204,This place does not feel mexican at all. Menu was has a  small selection and only had key tex mex dishes like fajitas and enchiladas. The michelida was served in a glass that was ment for a fancy mix drink and the rest of the beer next to it. The service was good but the way the restaurant was set up didn t make me feel like it was a real Mexican place.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,205,I was pleasantly surprised by the food and service at Micheladas.  We were greeted right away and seated.  Waiter was friendly and prompt with taking our order and refilling water and chips.  Enchiladas were very tasty and margaritas were strong and yummy.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,206,Crab stuffed achiote chicken breast was excellent.  I did not think the jalape o emulsion added anything special  I think it was just right without it. The achiote rub on the outside provided plenty of flavor. The creme brulee for dessert was  good   but didn t quite live up to the hype provided by the waiter. His description made me expect an out of body experience  it was good  but no out if body experience IMHO.  Will definitely return  maybe try b the tres leches cake for dessert.  The Pescado Veracruzano is definitely on the must-try entree list.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,207,We really enjoyed our dinner. The waiter was very patient and offered recommendations. I had the Green Chile Pork Tacos... Fantastic.... And during Happy Hour was even better... Loved it.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,208,Such terrible service. Went in a large group with a reservation. We all had very simple orders. Everyone got their entrees after waiting quite a while  although the restaurant was empty. I NEVER got my meal. The waiter finally realized I didn t have it and came back and asked what I ordered AFTER everyone finished eating. I told the waiter that there is no point of putting my order in after everyone cleaned their plate and was ready to leave. Absolutely horrendous customer service  and they didn t seem to feel bad about it at all. Didn t offer anything to make up for it. I sat with my large group and watched them all eat until they were ready to leave. Might have been the worst dining experience of my life.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,209,In spite of the fact that I m not generally a fan of tex-mex  I know   I did like this place. The gentleman working- his name might have been Gus  - greeted me with  Welcome  family   I felt so comfortable just walking in.   I was on my way to a session for my conference so had only a little time for a quick dinner. I got guacamole and the daily drink special- a Texas tea cocktail. The guac  made table side  or barside in this case   was great. The drink  I didn t care for it  but I don t think there s anything wrong with how it was made. I just don t much like Texas tea  but wanted to give it a shot since I try to sample local items when I travel.  I really loved the space- it s open  airy  and extremely comfortable  due largely to the fact that the staff  or Gus  at least  seem really glad you re there.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,210,Great food  drinks  atmosphere and service  The table side guacamole was some of the best I have ever had. Definitely a go to 
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,211,Food is good  nice atmosphere   but service sucks in bar area   No structure on which bartenders are working sections.   When busy they bogg down.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,212,The food was pretty good  and we enjoyed the meal.  Food arrived pretty quickly and was hot.  The downside  the music is so loud you cannot hear the person across the booth from you  and the service was pretty slow and drink refills scarce.  We could see cleaning products and brooms from our booth  I would think they would put these somewhere in the back.    I would not go out of my way to eat there  but it s convenient to the convention center  and again  our food was good.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,213,I was here in Austin and visited here  by far the best experience    Barry the bartender was amazing  Clean and fun    Definitely a place to visit  Can t wait to go back 
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,214,The worst place and service ever. They should not have signed up to do an event if they don t have the staff or intelligence to do so. A restaurant who has never had a full booking should not do an event. Got here at noon and it s almost 2 and no food. Complete fail. Couldn t give it zero stars.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,215,Food tastes ok  but is absolutely overpriced. Service was terrible  flat out. You walk in and it isn t clear who the host is. Figured it out eventually  asked the host who I should speak to for a table and he hesitated a little before he asked if I wanted to sit by myself at the bar. I walked over to the bar and no one acknowledged my existence for a while. Finally someone asked if I wanted water and chips  and I told her I wanted to order. My food came out before my drink - had to ask for the drink. The margarita tasted like syrup.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,216,Enjoyed this restaurant. It was within walking distance of my hotel and the service was great. I ll definitely try it again if I return to Austin.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,217,Service was very slowwwww. There was hardly anyone there. We got there 5 minutes before happy hour ended but by the time someone waited on us we couldn t order off the HH menu. I gave 3 stars because the margarita was good once we got it.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,218,I was nervous at first because of the 3 star rating  but it was close to both the hotel and convention center so we gave it a try. I m really glad we did.  The salsa was very fresh with heat that builds and sneaks up on you. Three of us ordered the chicken flautas and they were awesome. You get your choice of beans -- black  pinto  refried black  refried pintos or drunk beans. Order the drunk beans. It is pintos cooked in beer with onions and bacon  served with fresh cilantro. They made the meal. The rest of the group ordered nachos  fajita salad and the such  but we all agreed the food was great and were  glad we went. Give it a try.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,219,Conveniently located near the convention center and plenty of room inside or out for groups. The food is pretty good.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,220,Found this place while wandering around downtown Austin.  We were looking for a Tex mex place before the 4th of July fireworks.  Micheladas has a nice outdoor patio so we decided to stop in for some drinks and a snack.  We ordered the chicken enchiladas and margaritas. We also got a free order of queso with yelp checkin.  The mango and strawberry margaritas were yummy and made with fresh fruits.  The enchilada was pretty good and the chips with queso were great.  The waitress recommended the tres leche for dessert and we could say no as its made in house and very good.  It was light and fluffy.  Micheladas was overall pretty good and reasonable priced.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,221,Brenda  the owner  is my new bff  For serious. She s lovely  and she s generous  AND her food is delicious.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,222,If your server recommends their daily special of a  carnitas chimichanga  - for the love of all things delicious  Put down your menu and get that. Don t even look any further. Best carnitas I ve ever had plus the way they made the chimi so light and crisp on the outside without making the lettuce and pico inside is almost unfathomable. An absolute MUST try if you like tex-mex. Smothered in their just spicy enough chili con queso  this dish is now on the long list of must haves when I come to Austin. Highly highly recommended. Also  had a few bites of my girlfriends flautas and they were just as good as my chimi. Don t waste your time anywhere else. I never give 5 stars but the good here speaks for itself.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,223,The food was actually quite good. I am rating one star because of the disrespectful service we received. Please understand that I spent 10 years in the service industry so I understand what it s like to be on the other side of the apron.   My father and I went on a wine tour to celebrate Father s Day. As part of the tour we received an email offering free queso upon showing our wristbands . We decided to take advantage of the offer and stopped in after the tour to top off Dad s special day with a good meal. When we explained the offer to the server he explained that he had been there a number of years and had never heard of such an offer. He even checked with his manager to confirm. This was all fine.   My father then double checked his email and was able to pull up the offer and then showed it to the server. This is when things took a turn. Upon seeing the offer the server should have alerted his management again and allowed them to handle it. Instead he continued to cite the number of years he d been a server there and insisted  no such offer existed. At this point it was no longer about receiving something free but the principle of the matter. The server became defensive and even insulting stating several times the queso was very cheap  as if we could not afford it. We had already ordered drinks and food so I m not sure why he continued to harp on the price of the queso.  Upon questioning the server about the email the server stated the third-party making the offer was lying so as to be more advantageous to their own company.   Now  perhaps the offer was not cleared by both companies prior to being distributed. We actually noticed a nearby table having the same issue. However  their server responded to the situation in a much more polite manner. I do not agree with the statement that the customer is always right  but I do believe it s fair to say the customer should always be the number one priority. While the server did reluctantly deliver a bowl of queso he did so by then stating yet again how very cheap the queso is. He was demeaning and ensured that neither my father  myself nor anyone we know will visit this establishment in the future.   I should note the server told us more than once that if we really wanted a bowl of queso to check in on yelp. I hope this post serves to vindicate the bowl of queso he felt we did not deserve.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,224,This place was terrible. We walked in  the guy that sat us said that there were no small tables left so we HAD to sit at the bar. Once seated at the bar  the bartender practically ignored us for a few minutes. Once he did address us  all he did was brought water and said that the chips and salsa would be right out. Didn t ask us if we wanted anything to drink or anything. We asked to move to one if the smaller tables once it freed up because at this point the bar tender still had not come back to ask us if we were ready. I asked another server if she could wipe off the other table and she said sure. After waiting ten more minutes  no one wiped off the table. At this point  we have been waiting twenty minutes and still nothing. SO................ We walked out. Didn t have time to wait around and see if anything else would happen.   Terrible service Terrible bar tender- He favored to one side of the bar And terrible wait staff.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,225,We sat down in the bar area at 9 on a Saturday night while a playoff game was on. My cousin cheered and the manager Rudely told him to use his inside voice  like a child. A few minutes later a large group of guys came in from outside and yelled as well and the manager came out and automatically told my cousin that he was being childish because he was yelling while there was a family sitting close by. He never said anything to the large group of guys yelling because they were on their way out. This was the worst experience I ve had at a restaurant and I was only there for 15 minutes. Very rude manager and very bad wait staff. Also there was a gnat in one of the drinks we ordered. Never again will I return here. If I could  I d give zero stars.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,226,Was in Austin for a conference we had dinner with a client here. Food was ok.......margaritas were great.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,227,Food is great  service is just unprofessional. Management and employees don t seem to carry a filter on their language. Some of them have used vulgarity  managers included like the taller one wearing a blue shirt. Just overall improper. Bartenders and bussers were friendly  servers and managers were just sorry.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,228,Service was great.  We felt like old friends of both Barry the Bartender and John the Manager.  Drinks were delicious  and the food was amazing.  We enjoyed it so much  that we went back several times over the course of our short stay.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,229,Had breakfast here.  Food was good.  Cleanliness could have been better.  Had dried queso on the side of our table and on one of our plates.  Our table was very rickety as well so we asked to be moved to a new table.  Service was great.  The micheladas were good too.  If they clean things up a bit and fix the table  I could give them a 4 star review.  I would come back again.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,230,Came here for lunch. As a vegetarian I was disappointed to see not one vegetarian item on the lunch menu. Even the cheese items came with meat on top. Stayed for guacamole and a cocktail. The cocktail was okay. Guacamole was underwhelming but not horrible. Might give it a try again at night  but most likely will steer clear of it in the future.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,231,Horrible.  We did the buffet and it was obvious that the buffet is just a way to take advantage of a busy convention center with limited food options.  Plates were dirty  food was mediocre  had to wait for silverware  glasses and food to be replenished so we could eat. Not worthy even half the price we paid
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,232,i WISH i could give this place negative stars  it was THAT bad. first of all  lunch hour and the place looks closed its that empty  red flag right there  should have left immediately . walked in sat down at a dirty booth with chips and food remains on the seat and table  mosquitos everywhere on the INSIDE not patio area. The server is out of it  there s only one other table of 2 people there. he brings us water then leaves and 20 mins go by. he finally comes back and takes our order. we finally get the food which is bland and over cooked. within 20 minutes he comes back picks the plates up on top of the food which we still had OVER HALF of still left  and then just walks off with all our food    INSANEEEEE. he comes back with the check and just walks off. not sure what was wrong with this guy. no manager on site  no help. worst service we ve ever experienced. 20 bucks for fajitas that the waiter trashes midway through - this place is HORRIBLEEEEEE. the manager john is the rudest person possible in the restaurant industry. overall - garbage food and garbage service.  got bit TWICE by those disgusting mosquitos. this place is the absolute worst. never again. stay away.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,233,Had lunch there yesterday. Bartender waiter was super attentive to our group of seven. Hubby and I split the Seafood Enchilada plate - was a touch cold but I figured we were just first out. It was very tasty and contained whole  large size shrimp.  Yes I was surprised about that.   The Mexican Martini s were perfect. I m very picky and this place was fantastic about catering to my needs. Plus they had the playoff game on WITH the volume on  Loved that. Not many bars will let you listen to the game as you watch. I will be back.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,234,We came to a big convention  and they management was aware but not enough staff   and the only staff was running like a chicken without head. food is good  this place has a great potential. I will come next year and I m sure my experience will be different.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,235,We went by to check out Michelada s patio and food as a potential venue for an upcoming event. I was actually quit pleased by the location  downtown  right by the convention center  and drinks   3 happy hour margarita s  and their food.   I think that construction in the area is hurting their business  because on a Friday  for Happy Hour after work  the place was practically empty. But parking is available if you park at the convention center garage instead of trying for street parking. I think they need to consider some kind of valet service until this construction is completed  so that their customers can find visiting Michelada s easier.  The patio is a great place to sit during the evening. The heat of the Texas summer sun can make the patio a little oppressive before the Sun goes down because there is no shade to be found. But after the Sun is down  it s great.  I had the chicken fried steak for dinner because I wanted to try it. It was tasty and the potatoes were good. For a twist it is served with a yummy chorizo gravy instead of a cream gravy. I liked the twist. The cost was  14 for a very small steak  but this is downtown  so it s to be expected.  My friends had enchiladas. They liked them. The also liked the sweet salty spicy Lucas-like chili mix on the rims of their drink glasses. It s not Lucas  since they make it in-house  but it is a good imitation. Tasty  tasty  tasty.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,236,So disappointed. Came in for a bachelorette party that I planned  booked in for a party a month in advance and they were super accommodating. Came in tonight  they didn t put us on the patio  which we requested a month in advance  our food came our lukewarm an hour and a half later  the manager challenged me when I met with him about it and tried to act combatively towards us. He also refused to run our checks because it wasn t his job  the server needed to do it.  It s currently 11 00 and our reservation was at 8 30 and we ordered before 9 pm. We will NOT be back. The best they could do was 10  off and he challenged me when we placed our orders. There are maybe 5 tables full here and his blame was on last night being too busy. Taco Bell might be better than this.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,237,Great staff  amp  attention to detail. Food was awesome for a mexican place. Great place for quaint brunch  lunch or dinner  Would not go here for special occassions. More so for a date night
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,238,Location was perfect for us. The fajitas and chilequiles were quite good and fresh.  Service was outstanding. Just what we were looking for  
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,239,Do not eat at this place if you want your food in a reasonable time.  45-minutes after placing order got up and walked out so have no idea if the food is any good or not
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,240,So was out and about around Town Lake a couple of Sundays ago. My lady and I were looking for a place to get some margaritas and possibly hang out on a patio to while away the afternoon. I saw that two of my Yelp friends  Errol M  and Stacy M.  had recently checked in here that day. I always love an opportunity to hang out with fellow Yelpers  so I decided we should try out this place. We got there around 3 and a waiter told us that they were closed.      But the hours of operations on your Yelp page says 10-9. The only saving grace was the bartender said he could fix us up with a drink still. But we were looking for a place to hang out so we declined.   Fix your info  I will give this place another try. But I rarely get down that way  so until I do this review will have to suffice
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,241,SO RUDE   Worst service and horrible  manager . Terrible drink and food service. Manager lied about being 2 hours behind a reservation on cinco de mayo.... when the restaurant had 2 tables.... would NEVER come here again. Biggest waste of time AND money. Beyond disappointed.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,242,The food was very good but the service is super horrible and slow. They never gave us chips n salsa  we waited for 25 minutes for our drinks and then couldn t get a refill. I ordered table side guac and the waiter literally took 39 minutes to bring it then didn t give me any chips. Then got snippy when asked for a refill on Dr Pepper for the third time
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,243,Sat at the bar. Great service  Loved the Michelada. They do make them well here. The queso is very good and my tortilla soup was the best I ve had in a long time.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,244,Wonderful place to try Great Tex-mex  came with friends and family . Service was wonderful and everything was at great speed 
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,245,My lady and I went to this place before a concert to get some food.  The atmosphere was nice...not a bunch of tables crowded together so I didn t have to wonder if anyone was eavesdropping on the conversation.  The margaritas were amazing...I wish they were bigger  but I wish that about all of my drinks.  We started with half dozen oysters...topped with cheese  cilantro and bacon  which are my three favorite things in the world  and as someone who s not an oyster fan  I actually enjoyed them.    I had the flautas...they re not like Chuy s flautas.  They weren t greasy and gross...they were crisp  delicious and topped with crema and avocado.  Absolutely wonderful.  My lady had enchiladas...chicken with the sauza and cheese with chili con carne.  The con carne was amazing  as was the sauza.  The salsa was fresh and wonderful and perfect in my opinion.  Our waiter  Russ  was so knowledgeable about everything on the menu and offered up recommendations.  Probably one of the most attentive waitstaff I ve come across in Austin.  If he s working  you should ask to sit in his section.  You won t be disappointed with service if he s taking care of your table.  I ll definitely be back.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,246,The drinks at this place are really good  the staff was really nice. However their food needs improvement. I would recommend this place for drinks and maybe appetizers before you go out  but not for dinner. Their flautas were extremely greasy and I didn t like them.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,247,Great patio brunch. Awesome food  enjoyed the Benedict and break fast tacos. The free queso and check in was the bomb.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,248,1 star for the Bloody Mary  Met here this past Saturday for the Texas Wino Tour. The profusely sweaty  cursing  loud server manager made us so uncomfortable that we moved out of the bar area to the front of the restaurant. He also announced to everyone that water was not free for the wine beer tour groups. It was a very unpleasant start to the day. We really hope Texas Winos reconsider their meeting point.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,249,Everything was perfect. The guacamole is prepared right at the table and is delicious. Tacos were awesome too  Erika served us really really well. Thank you  I can totally recommend this place 
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,250,Probably the worse meal I and four of my co-workers have had in a long  long time.  Cons  The salsa was bland and watery.  The waitstaff seemed confused.  The food was way over priced  even for downtown.  The menu was very limited.  Our meal took 45 minutes to come out and almost all of our orders were wrong.  Almost everyone thought their food tasted boiled and bland.  The waitress was not attentive and there seemed to not be manager in sight.  I got the carne guidada taco.  The tortilla was flour when I asked for corn.  The sauce was strange and maybe from a powder or a can    and the meat was so bland I couldn t finish my second mouthful.  The food took so long that half of us had to leave early and go back to the office.    Pros  They spent all their money on decor and it shows.  The queso was yummy and spicy.  Don t go there.   Unless you are there for over priced drinks and queso.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,251,Had a great lunch while at a convention. Bartender was great  food was delicious  I had the chicken fajita taco lunch special  my mom had the tortilla soup  which she says was AWESOME . Will definitely eat here again if I m ever back in the area.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,252,We were very very disappointed in this restaurant. Especially after all the amazing food we had enjoyed in Austin.  1st let me say the server was fantastic and completely overwhelmed.  We were a larger group and they were not prepared to handle us.  It appeared they were at least one server short for our group.  But that didn t seem to be the issue as much as the kitchen s ability to get the food and drinks out in a timely manner.  Our table was trying to pay and we noticed the 3rd table in our group was just getting their dinner. The food was marginal at best too.  We thought the service was bad because the restaurant was so busy.  But we walked down to the main dining areas and the place wasn t even 1 2 full.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,253,If I could post a negative  star   review  I would.  The food is mediocre  the wait staff is awful  and drinks are overpriced.  Go to El Chil  
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,254,It was fine. Empty on a Sunday afternoon and the wait staff was nice but not overly attentive.  I just had a beer and appetizer at the bar  so giving a rating on food wouldn t be fair ... food was ok but not a lot to ruin with chili con queso.  The Austin pearl beer was good and I m not much of a beer person.  Average price point. Lots of restaurant options in downtown Austin so probably would not come back.  But you may want to try it if you have a craving for Mexican food.  I saw them bring some food items out to other tables and it all looked tasty.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,255,Uggh. Went to Michelada s yesterday in between SXSW parties. We were in need of food and drinks and it was right around the corner. The queso was meh  the tacos were mediocre  at best  and the michelada was downright disappointing.   But honestly  we could have handled all of that if the service had been at least adequate... unfortunately it was terrible. We were the only people in the place  but our server disappeared for for about an hour and then completely screwed up our checks -- a friend ended up paying double her bill but by that point we just wanted to get out of there so we didn t even say anything.   Also  the bathroom is weird.   This place s only hope is convention traffic because there s no way they ll be able to rely on locals.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,256,Service was almost non-existent. Food when delivered was average. Chicken tasted fresh. Guacamole and salsa were fresh.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,257,Service was quick  flavors were decent  chips didn t taste fresh but the salsa was good. Queso satisfied me. The tacos I had were aight.   Place is MASSIVE  like absolutely huge. Oddly it wasn t insanely packed during SXSW. Also feel bad judging the food  they had a very small selection to chose from during the conf.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,258,This is one of Austin s most promising new restaurants. Reasonable prices  great food  and and an amazing atmosphere  I m looking forward to them opening the huge open top deck.    Chips and salsa came out immidiately when we sat down  followed by our friendly waiter  who recommended a few things on the menu. My michelada with chile salt complemented their tasty queso perfectly. I started with Oysters  tasted fresh and had a little spice. Then I got down with one of my favorite Tex-Mex dishes next  verde enchiladas. They have a unique spin on verde sauce  it s dark with a smoky poblano kick. Refried black beans were awesome  get them. Also save a little room for their creamy tres leches.   I m not a food citric but I know what good Tex-Mex tastes like. This is a good spot and a great addition to the vibrant restaurants in Austin.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,259,Paul provided exceptional service  Great micheledas  Will be coming back next time we are in Austin. Thanks again Paul
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,260,The food overall was pretty good and the service was good as well. Only a few things that I bothered me  1. The salsa was way to hot  why not have some options in heat so my kids can eat the salsa too.2. The option of kids meals are pretty much just chicken quesadilla.  The location Needs major updating  the men and women s bathroom is labeled with blue painters tape.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,261,I d give this place negative stars  if I could. Service is terrible. We had to ask for chips and salsa 3 times... And still waiting. 30 mins after ordering  random person tells me they are out of my order. Two other tables seated after us were served before us cuz apparently it takes an hour to make tacos.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,262,Guacamole  salsa  and our entrees we re all very good  amp  authentic but the service was very very slow. Not very busy so can t explain the slow service. Waitress seemed to be just having a bad day.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,263,I came with a party of eight and the first thing the waiter said was  I apologize but I am the only waiter for all these tables . Is that code for  you need to expect bad service   The service was average and the food was above but the real kicker came after the check. I tipped 17  in spite of the average service and the server texted a complaint to the person who had set up our reservation.....really   He complained that we didn t tip more....since when does average service demand above average tips     
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,264,I ll start with saying the food is good and chips are addicting. The problem is the service is terrible and we were one of two patrons. Absolutely ridiculous. Micheladas are NOT good which is ironic. The location is awesome. It s sad bc the food is actually good. They need to up their service. Our waiter had zero personality and didn t even bring us utensils and napkins until we asked for it.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,265,The micheladas are tiny they use a tall cocktail glass not the goldfish mugs that I m used to in other places.   In other words you could pour 2 or three of this places micheladas into the ones that they have a most Mexican restaurants. Same price also no thanks
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,266,First time to this restaurant. Celebrating daughters 21st Bday. 5 in party-Monday evening. Wasnt sure at first   just because of some of the reviews on this website  and I m picky. I work hard for my money and dont like to feel as though I wasted it. Birthday girl wanted a dinner downtown and talked me into trying it... GLAD WE DID. We were greeted and seated right away. Atmosphere was nice and warm.  Russ was our waiter. He was fabulous and knew all entrees like he created them himself.Very attentive  but not overkill.  Dinner was great. We had  Beef fajitas w  onions  tri colored peppers and all the fixins  Seafood Stacked Enchiladas  Pollo  Caliente   Chicken Enchiladas. Everything was delicious and flavorful. We also had a large queso  FYI- it comes w sliced jalepenos stirred in it  which would easily serve 6  and guacamole  made tableside . Salsa w  chips was fresh made I believe. Really good w  a little kick. I had 2 Mojito drinks. The flavor was spot on  but they definitely lacked alcohol. No warm fuzzies over cocktails for sure     Oh yeah  if you like black beans  try theirs. Mine were the bomb. The way they are prepared caused them to be in kind of a creamy broth rather than black beans in water. Almost like a black bean soup. Really Good  All 5 of us had dinner plus 4 cocktails total  for a little over 100 bucks. Very reasonable  Check it out. You will  be glad you did 
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,267,Food was good. Nothing to complain about. Comfortable  clean. Ample outdoor space. Dog friendly.  Brought a water dish out for the pups. Waiter was a little awkward  but friendly and helpful. Will come back but next time will order tres leches without chocolate.   
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,268,My friend and I walked in because I am in town visiting. And I have a service dog. We were greeted  by the hostess and decided to sit at the bar because there was no one anywhere but two guest at the bar and didn t seem to be bothered. As we were ordering drinks  then I assume manager both motions and tells us that there are no dog allowed. He doesn t ask if it s a service dog or politely start conversation with us about it. Plus I had already told the hostess that he was a service dog and even have my ID card on me to show them. He insist that my dog is still not allowed in the restaurant. As we walk out the patio door  the other manager insist that he had to have a vest on. When in fact I don t have to have a vest on my dog  nor even show his ID  which is both on his collar and behind my ID In my phone case. They both continue to jester that my dog and I must sit on the Patio. So we left. Very rude. If I could give 0 stars I would. Because it s crazy how Jw Marriott welcomes my dog and I  but I can t walk down to a place that is dead and give them business.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,269,Great place  Staff was attentive never had to ask for anything. Tortilla soup was by far the best in Austin even beats The Mansion in Dallas  Decor is top notch and fits the downtown area. Wanted Texas sweet tea and they made it special for us. Oh but the Mexican martini with chili salt was a perfect pairing. We will be back 
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,270,Had some time to kill before our flight back home to San Diego after a weekend of debouchery at ACL fest and how could we resist stopping for a michelada.  So glad we did   Sat at the bar ordered two micheladas served w dos Equis beer.Sip pour sip pour   Yumm      They serve free chips and salsa.  Chips were fresh and light.  Our waiter  Nico  an up and coming music producer in the hip hop scene  was so nice and made the BEST micheladas I ve ever had.  That s saying a lot since I live in a town bordering Mexico.  Thanks man   Good luck to you and we ll see you next year for ACL  
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,271,I live walking distance so that is part of the charm but this place is never packed and service is pretty quick. I love their breakfast tacos  they are tasty and simple. I have been there for lunch once and dinner twice. I haven t had anything there that I haven t enjoyed.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,272,On a whim we tried it for the first time today and loved it. It was a beautiful afternoon so we sat outside. Service  drinks and food were all wonderful.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,273,Great place  great patio  tasty food  amp  drink and great service. Our server was very attentive to me and 16 month old. Watermelon margaritas .... Yum 
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,274,Really enjoyed their Michelada  Chips and salsa we re great too  Will be back to try their food.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,275,This place could be much much better if mgmt hired more attentive waitstaff. Had to ask for silverware  not a huge deal but it was never brought to me  picked up my own from neighboring table. Was never offered a refill on my non alcoholic drink  had to get up and walk to the bar for refill. Took ten min for my friend to get a beer. The food itself was great. No complaints on that  the staff however were clueless. Seems from the other review left earlier tonight I m not the only one who felt this way. To management  you could have a great thing going here... Perhaps pay more attention on who you have serving your guests.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,276,I don t know what to make of this place...  it was odd.  we attended a  grand opening party .  free liquor brings out all sorts of people  myself included .  but this crowd...  I was half expecting a fist fight to break out any minute.  we had a few odd exchanges with people that needed a refresher course in manners.  some guy taking chairs from our table as his girlfriend yelled behind him  JUST TAKE  EM  JUST TAKE EM  YOU DON T NEED TO ASK    and some guy that got all upset because I was trapped and had to say  excuse me  about 6 times so I could get out.  then the table next to us chain smoked  one after the other  all four of them.  the girl closest to us held her cigarette over her shoulder  away from her own table and closer to our table....  I d really like to see smoking sections for patios and decks.  most people do not smoke  but it only takes a few to create a bunch of second hand smoke.  they easily smoked a whole pack in the 30 minutes we sat there.  we finally gave up and went to Fleming s  across the street   if I were to rate the people...  one would be too many stars.  so I ll talk about the food.  the food was really pretty good   we had a couple tacos and some guac and some samplings of their salsas....  really good stuff.  the tacos al pastor had the seasoning down perfectly  just like I remember from when I used to travel across the Yucatan  I was a young man back then   drinks...  the margartias were free when we arrived and they were pretty good too.  the drink line was long but the staff worked hard to make it move fast.    while in line  I heard one guy say  what is that about grand opening   this place has been open a while .    then the free drinks dried up.  but sort of how a dealer will give you that first hit for free  the people were already feeling good.  they stayed to pay for their drinks.  I thought to myself   this is genius   they could have a regular Grand Opening party where people are lured in by free drinks  but end up staying to spend a bunch of money   we later met a guy that used to work there.  his opinion was that the owner wants to be open for big events but doesn t care so much about being open full time.  maybe that is about to change.  I ll agree their location is more convenient to the convention center than it is to locals.    I m not saying I won t go back...  but I certainly won t go back for a free drink party.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,277,Stumbled into this place after going to an event at the convention center. We were pleasantly surprised  We didn t expect anything next to the convention center to have much soul  but this place is great  Charming atmosphere inside  lots of wood and leather chairs. Spicy salsa  and my migas were delicious. We enjoyed our lunch 
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,278,My husband and I were visiting from out of town and we found this place on yelp. Very happy we did  The food was outstanding  really great flavors. We sat on the upstairs outdoor patio and it was a great environment. The strawberry basil lemonade was delicious   
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,279,Food was excellent  service was excellent  but I deduct points for three reasons. 1  no free parking  even though there s an open lot right next door that isn t used 2  a little pricier than the nearby Mexican restaurants - lunch special is  10  prices not listed on website  and 3  here s what pissed me off the most - I dined in with a co-worker  but ordered a third meal to go for another co-worker who couldn t take a lunch  all on one bill   and they still charged me the carryout fee. I could MAYBE  not really  understand adding this charge if we took all our meals to go  but we dined in. Honestly  I ve never been charged a carryout fee ANYWHERE before and that rubbed me the wrong way.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,280,Just left. We waited 30 minutes  for a table in an empty restaurant and sat at that table for another 30 minutes with out being talked to by a single server. Awful. While walking out we were finally spoken to and said  where you going . Pitiful service. We wound up at PF Changs were sat right away and hat waters in 5 minutes. Stay Away.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,281,Who else gives you oysters for brunch   And Riptide oysters  not Gulf oysters  at that.  Sure  they re not on the brunch menu  but the entire menu is available during brunch  so go nuts  The salsa is extra fresh  and swimming with cilantro. I m a cilantro fiend  so this works well for me. I went through about 2.5 bowls of salsa  without finishing a basket of chips  . That s telling.  My partner had some sort of extra spicy steak enchiladas. He said he had to suck down mimosas to balance the heat on that dish  and that s find because the mimosas were  2 and bloodies were only  5. Oh  and because we love spicy stuff. I was half expecting Micheladas to be a  safe  bland Tex-Mex joint   but the fact that they kicked things up a notch made me extra happy.   I ordered a shrimp taco  great price   and loved it. I felt uber healthy  and uber happy after having it. I only had the one taco  but that s all I needed. I was full  and my partner was STUFFED.   Go on a weekend  or even for happy hour. The frozen margs are nice and tart  and the patio is HUGE 
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,282,We really wanted some good tex mex while visiting and found this place. The inside is very nice as well as the patio outside.  What I didn t like was the salsa.  It was just like spicy water to me.  It had no flavor and fell right off the chips.  The chips were good though.  I got the chicken tacos and they were actually really good.  The chicken was juicy and tender  however the rice and beans were not that good.  The rice was bland and the black beans were also very runny.  Seems like they like to water food down here  Overall I wouldn t go back if in town again.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,283,This place is big and impersonal looking but it is close to our condo and is dog friendly so we decided that we should at least give it a try. We are glad we did because the outdoor patio was pleasant  the wait staff was efficient and most importantly the food was very good  excellent even.  As expected we were served chips and salsa shortly after sitting down. Our dog was also brought a bowl of water  which was appreciated. The chips were good but the salsa was outstanding  very fresh and bright tasting. We both ordered a bowl of tortilla soup which was tasty and a bit different from the other versions we enjoy around town. Here it had roasted corn and chunks of carrot in addition to the usual chicken  cheese  avocado  and tortilla strips.   We tried a michelada which my husband liked but I just don t like the drink whereas I do like margaritas a lot and they served me a nicely balanced one    We will go back and try more soon. We are glad we tried the place.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,284,As far as tex-mex goes  this place is pretty darn good. I played it safe with enchiladas but I wasn t disappointed.   I m only giving it three stars because of the service. Maybe our waiter was new but he forgot to take a few of our groups food orders  forgot drinks  and even lost the piece of paper he took our order down on.  We got to eat eventually  when he remembered we needed forks  and that s all that really matters 
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,285,I ordered the Migas and my husband had the beef tacos . The migas is made with scrambled eggs   peppers topped off with avocado . It was little disappointing  I was expecting tortilla chips and  jalapenos cooked in  with the eggs. I had this before at a different restaurant and it was superb . The tacos were very good per my husband. The rice and their black beans was to die for . The service was fast and friendly. The restaurant is very spacious and looks like it would be a lot of fun at night for drinks.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,286,I really hate writing reviews like this for new restaurants.  Let me state right out that this place is not bad.  It s not   But it wasn t good either.  If I had to sum up the experience in one word  it would be bland.  We ordered micheladas and they were bland  even with the chili salt lining the rim of the glass.  I m pretty sure they used bloody mary mix instead of Clamato  which is fine when you re serving someone with a known shellfish allergy  but otherwise it takes away from the classic michelada flavor.  The chips at the table were good  but the table salsa was bland and over salted.  We asked if they had any other type of salsa and were given a small container of salsa verde that was likewise bland.    For our entrees I ordered flautas and the husband ordered the chile relleno with beef.  I was confused when I was given my plate because the flautas were not fried crisp.  The tortillas the shredded chicken was in were soft  making it seem like I was eating enchiladas with no sauce or cheese  which was not very appetizing.  They came with lettuce  avocado  and a bit of cheese on top  but it was pretty flavorless.  The rice was good with a hint of cilantro and lime  but the black beans that came with the meal were awful.  Bland and mushy.  The husband s chile relleno came with sauce on the side  but even with the sauce it didn t really taste like anything besides unseasoned beef stuffed into a serrano pepper and deep friend in unseasoned breading.  Again  none of the food was bad  except those horrid beans   but this was one of those situations where you eat everything on your plate because the flavor is unsatisfying and you are desperately searching for flavor pockets or at least trying to find satisfaction in fullness. For two micheladas and two entrees we ended up paying close to  50 with tip  making us feel like we definitely did not get our money s worth.  The disappointing food is a real shame too because this is a gorgeous restaurant.  Both the indoor dining area and bar areas are open  bright  and airy and they have patio and rooftop seating.  The service was also good with a waitress who was almost a little too attentive since we were one of only a handful of tables at lunch.  I feel like this place has potential  but in the way that a blank canvas has the potential to become a painting.  If they could get the kitchen to up their game and start taking some risks with flavor then this could be a great restaurant  but as it stand now it s a bland  expensive meal in a pretty package.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,287,This little place  hands down  has the best margaritas. The frozen Sangria Margarita was the best I ve ever tasted. The service was top notch. The waitress recommended the queso with our chips and it was wonderful  not your typical melted block of cheese.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,288,The new Micheladas restaurant in downtown Austin is wonderful. If you re a vegetarian like me  there aren t a ton of options  as with most Mexican restaurants   but you ll find the huevos rancheros are fantastic. The ambiance is quite nice as well. Give Micheladas a try  You ll be glad you did.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,289,Okay here s my brunch menu guidance  - Potatoes are  seasoned   frozen  variety.  Not my bag  but if you are nursing a hangover  they might help you absorb whatever needs to be soaked up. - Migas - not even close to what I ve had elsewhere in town. If you ve never had Migas  then I d still avoid - I don t want you to get the wrong impression. - Queso - likely base is nacho cheese from a can  dressed up with some chiles.  It is not good. - Biscuits and chorizo gravy. They are okay.  Gravy was very salty.  Biscuits were dry but made a great vehicle for absorbing over easy eggs so... - Bloody Mary - was spicy  Observations of stuff I didn t order - fajitas or other sizzling items looked a bit more appealing.  This is a locally owned business so I may give it another shot.  Patio was nice. It is literally across from the convention center and for the price point  is not a terrible option.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,290,Very good  I enjoyed the chicken enchiladas with suiza sauce  Excellent   Also had a margarita presidente which was excellent  Got a free con queso dip with a yelp check in...delicious   Service was great  Overall a great experience    Would recommend to anyone 
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,291,Had lunch here today between sessions at a conference. One in our party was a vegetarian and some of us just wanted something light. Our waiter  Russell  was wonderful  Very friendly  attentive and accommodating. We were able to alter a couple of dishes to make them vegetarian. The quesadilla without the pork belly but with added veggies was wonderful. Our vegetarian friend enjoyed her black bean and veggie Nachos. The service was outstanding. The food was delicious. The decor was comfortable and inviting. I would definitely return. Very convenient to the convention center.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,292,I have now eaten at Michelada s twice and I m here to tell you it is great.  It s also way under priced for the quality of food served.  I m a bit of a restaurant snob  but not in a bad way  I just know high quality food.  I can tell the difference between fresh  amp  homemade and something out of a can.  And this place is fresh - and seriously good.    I read the other reviews and was really surprised by the one star review that commented on how the salsa was  watery  and the food tasted  boiled and bland .  Makes me wonder if we went to the same place.  The salsa is fantastic.  You can see and taste all the individual ingredients as just that  individual ingredients.  It s not a homogenous brown soup that s been sitting since 5 a.m..  The same quality is evident in the guacamole  which they make up fresh at your table according to your wishes.  Oh and the tortillas are not out of a pack  they re the real deal.  Everything I ve had was loaded with flavor and there are a lot of really nice surprises if you ve grown a little weary of the same Austin Tex-Mex every night.  I eat LOTS of Tex Mex and Interior Mexican cuisine.  We eat regularly at Curra s South  Serranos  amp  Julio s  I have also eaten at Fonda San Miguel  Chapala  Manuel s  Maria s  Enchiladas Y Mas....I could go on all night with Mexican restaurants across the quality spectrum.  The quality of food here is on par with Fonda San Miguel - the prices are on par with Enchiladas Y Mas.  It s a bargain.     My favorite entree so far is the shrimp taco.  The street corn is really good too and has a lot of complexity in the flavor  going from tangy at first taste  to slightly cheesy  Queso fresco     to slightly barbecuey and then you get some fire in the after taste.  Really Good stuff.   Shared a Mexican Martini my first trip in and it was good too.  Plenty of alchohol  but not so much you couldn t drink it  and most importantly  not loaded up with cheap  sweet syrupy mixer.  The only downside I can see is you can t park two steps from the door.  It s downtown across from Fleming s and the convention center.  We park in a public garage about 1 2 a block away.  It was  5 to park on a weekend night and free on a Wednesday.  With the price of the food as low as it is though  the extra  5 is nothing.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,293,Really like this place. Tried the Mexican Martini  it has a bit too much OJ but otherwise its good. My partner had the jalapeno poppers and said they were EXTRA spicy since the seeds werent removed. I only had the queso and focused more on drinking since it was Happy Hour. I also tried the house margarita which was good. It was rather warm inside for some reason and there is construction going on but it doesnt affect anything as we walked since our hotel was 2 blocks away. I will return here every time I stay in Austin no doubt.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,294,I was really excited to try this place. However  when we first walked in we felt very unwelcome. We immediately were told there were only two servers for a Saturday night and we arrived at 7 30pm. They said it would be a 25 minute wait. We decided to wait anyways  about 5 minutes later we were seated. This made me think that they originally were just trying to get us to leave. The waiter was very attentive  but the food was just okay. I had the chicken tacos and they weren t anything special. No seasoning at all. I give it a two because of our waiter  he was great but other than that  it wasn t worth it.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,295,Meh...  Our dinner started off on a bad foot when our when our waiter complained about being tired and wanting to go home.  Surprising since there was only four tables in the main dining room including us  and it was still early. . Margarita on the rocks tasted like a mix despite the description indicating otherwise .  Salsa was the best part of the meal.  Oh well   we won t be back.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,296,OK Guys.  This place came highly recommended.  And maybe they were having a very bad day.  But my office group reserved a big table several weeks in advance  and confirmed the reservation the day before.  We got there at noon on a Wednesday - they do have a table for us  but apparently that s all.  After 25 minutes someone came to take drink orders - we all ordered water  which took another 15 minutes.  They were slow to take our doers and very oblique as to why it was all taking so long.  Anyway  I had to leave after 2 hours - never having received my meal.  My compatriots brought my order to me at work and I ate for dinner that night.  Can t really judge the food  but because of the slowness I won t be going back.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,297,The only good thing about my food was the fajitas the rice was hard the beans tasted old they gave me corn tortillas instead of flour and my girls soup was cold it was bad
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,298,although it took them a while to seat our large group in a nearly empty restaurant the food was worth the wait. The pork chop was AMAZING   
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,299,I m not sure why people are hating below. Most likely they are the angry types with personal problems and giving negative reviews get s them off. Glad I am not wired that way....  I went here on Saturday night for dinner with a party of 8 and everyone enjoyed their dinner. I was able to visit with the owners and get a little insight. This is a brand new restaurant and they never did a soft opening so they are still training the staff. AND EVERYTHING WAS TASTY  WHICH IS IMPRESSIVE IN MY OPINION     Most of our table tried a few differnt types of tacos with nothing but positive feedback. I had the fajitas which is my way of judging a mexican restaurant. Beef was juicy and tender  refried black beans were really good  too.  Things are looking up...  I actually thought the drink prices were pretty reasonable for the area  you are drinking downtown  cheap-o s  this is not a cantina in San Marcos specializing in dollar beers   strong  and were not oversweet like a lot of places. Oh and those ballers on a budget  they are serving brunch on the weekends with two dollar mimosas.  The deck upstairs is amazing and will be one of my spots for happy hour whether I am with friends or colleagues from work.  Once they are fully up and running  I can see this place win a five star review. Exceptional atmosphere  food  drinks  just working out the training kinks   Please do disregard the bad reviews and check it out 
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,300,Group of 5 coworkers came here for lunch today.  Food was cheap - but you get what you pay for.  VERY small serving sizes.  The kitchen put the wrong beans on the wrong platter  so we had to play switcharoo.  The server  Barry  appeared upset we didn t order alcoholic beverages during our work day  and it seemed that it was too much trouble to get straws and limes for our water.  The server had a real problem with leaning over the table instead of walking around the table.  He pretty  much wrapped lime in a napkin and tossed it across the table to my boss for her water.  Is it really too much trouble to walk around the table   The coworker to my left handed him the menu around the back of my head so I wouldn t get smacked in the face  and that apparently irritated him  so he retaliated by refilling everyone s tea glass but hers.  Chips never got refilled.  He also dropped the cloth napkin he had tucked into his back pocket on the floor.  He walked over  picked it up  and put it back on his pocket.  Gross.  He wasn t that busy  so I don t understand his attitude.  This was my second time here and I won t go back.  I thought the first time I went and had bad service from the bartender that it was just a fluke.  Nope.  I guess the only reason they re in business is because they are downtown near the convention center.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,301,Seriously over priced and not even good. I got chicken fajitas and they were rubbery and not worth  15  The  famous michelada  wasn t even a real michelada  It was just Bloody Mary mix and they put ice in it    I can t get over how expensive it is.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,302,We had to wait a while before our order was taken. We ordered the chicken taco plate. The ingredients were pretty basic  but everything tested fresh and well cooked. I would come back just to try something else on the menu.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,303,Amazing. Best queso I ve never made  Staff is wonderful  and the atmosphere is very relaxing. I truly enjoy everything about this place 
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,304,To be fair we had a large group for a friend s birthday so when the wait staff took about 30 minutes to take our order and informed us they were overwhelmed we were understanding. Unfortunately when the food came out  half the group received it when the other half had almost finished. I gave an extra star after hearing from friends that their dishes tasted good but I ordered the steak fajitas and after eating one had not one but 5 different people try it and the consensus was a sour face and a   what is that   comment. So overall recommendation is do not go with a large group and do not get the fajitas 
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,305,Service and food were amazing. Felt really well taken care of. Plus  delicious free queso on check in  Will definitely be back to try some of the other menu items. Had the mixed fajitas and they were AMAZING. So much food.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,306,Staff and service were great   Food was awesome as well. I ve worked downtown for a couple of months now  and it was a great place to go after work for somewhere nice to hang out  and miss traffic.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,307,Me and boys DollarSign and Garrett C. ate here for lunch. Huge boss sized tacos and spicy salsa  GG M8
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,308,was here last week and it was so good  The Queso and guac are to die for and  I will be thinking about them until I return. The pork chop plate was amazing and I think it might have been designed just for me  Great service and our server was very nice and friendly. Will definitely be back and enjoy that patio when it is cooler  Thanks for the queso  
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,309,Wonderful recommendation from hotel staff. The tortilla soup was fabulous  My dad said his Mexican Benedict was the best Benedict he has ever had  and the carnitas was the best I have ever had. Soooo good 
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,310,Welcome to the neighborhood Meech.  So I ve been waiting for this place to open for a while now  I work around the corner and always noticed the what seemed to be  awesome rooftop patio.  But now it finally has opened so me and my co-worker went in after work.  We just sat at the bar to find out what was going on with the place  the place just opened so we were nt expecting 5 star service or anything like that.  The bartender told us about there happy hour and future plans for it.  We just went with the michelada and their margarita.  Both were made with an in house recipe that you could tell was right on.  We then got a couple tacos  I got a shredded chicken taco for  3.50  and my friend got the pork belly taco  I never was a fan of pork belly  but my friend liked it and he said it was pretty amazing.  Definately a good size taco and did the trick for me.  The decor was well done and the open door windows flow from the entrance all the way to the back deck.  Huge tvs were behind the bar  I guess i would tell my boyfriend to come in there for a game and cheap drinks if he wanted to wait for me to get off work one day.  The bartender kept telling us about their upcoming huge grand opening party on the patio  he took us up there to show it off  it looked pretty cool  3 more bars  more tvs  and a nice view of the downtown skyline  definately will be going back when that opens.  So I liked them on facebook to get the invite for it  cant wait.  The good thing also is they do industry service discount  so we get 20  off everytime we go.  That I can live with  we will definately be back with more friends.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,311,Tired of the run of the mill Tex-Mex  Looking for great  handmade margaritas  Then this place is perfect. The salsa was fresh  chunky and full of flavor. My market fresh fish tacos  snapper that day  were great  and big   Everything tasted fresh  with a hint of heat. The interior of the restaurant was festive  and the waitstaff quick and friendly. They ve only been open less than four months  November 23rd  I think our server said  so be weary of poor reviews written on 12 1  They ve really gotten the menu down.
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,312,I reallllly love this place and the queso is awesome   The ONLY reason I m giving a 4 is because I was a little upset the online prices are not correct.  So getting the bill when I called to order for a pick up  was quite a surprise  since I had an estimated total in mind.  When I asked the GM Robert about it  he was more than helpful and fixed the problem.  Still love this place 
Micheladas Cafe y Cantina,313,Expected way more from this place.  They have great atmosphere and location  and then they serve you the worst tasting Margaitas in Austin  food is just ok would not go back.
San Juanita Tacos,1,Still the best tacos in Austin and they just changed their flour tortillas to house-made  even better.   Open every day for breakfast and lunch.
San Juanita Tacos,2,Great breakfast tacos  amp  service. I come here regularly  amp  enjoy the picadillo tacos especially... As well as their crunchy beef taco plate- the shells are next level crispy   Love the spicy salsa  amp  chilaquiles Verdes as well.  Consistent  local  amp  tasty  so I will keep on coming back 
San Juanita Tacos,3,This little joint is located in a strip plaza off of South Congress. Their menu includes breakfast and lunch options. They do serve beer and margaritas  we were there for breakfast  so we stuck with coffee . We ordered the Juevos a la Mexicana and the Migas Especiales with chorizo. Both were fantastic. They were served with tortillas and salsa. Everyone who worked there was friendly and accommodating. It was a very inexpensive and satiating meal. Definitely a  no frills  spot  which is always nice.
San Juanita Tacos,4,The tacos here are good  we use to get them when we were kids so it s sort of nostalgic for me.  With this said their queso game is unfortunately poor at best. First of all 6  for this little cup and for some reason the cheese sauce looks separated  and the taste is of something I melted in the microwave as a after school snack.  Just not great or good.  Tacos are great  Queso not so much.
San Juanita Tacos,5,All the food here is so yummy    I m a fan of the vegetarian plate and the al pastor tacos  I know  I m complicated . Ask for a little verde salsa for your chips because it s awesome.  The waitstaff is friendly but can be a little frantic when it gets busy. I love that I can walk here from my house and that it is near the park.  I ve taken stuff to go and ate in the park  on a swing  like a child. Try it.   The salsa is some of the best in town and the iced tea I would like to inject directly into my veins. This is a common lunch spot for us.
San Juanita Tacos,6,I really enjoy the food and good costumer service  I like the authentic Mexican food And that it s not Tex-Mex..finally I found a good place to be a regular.
San Juanita Tacos,7,i recommend  very scrumptious i like their burritos and quesadillas quite a bit and they have big red  best drink ever 
San Juanita Tacos,8,love this spot  will drive in from Buda bc it s one of the best Mexican restaurants in the south Austin area in my opinion. Everything here tastes great 
San Juanita Tacos,9,2 stars just because the tacos are really good  However  customer service   Piss poor. Yesterday 2 20 was my first time trying these tacos and they were good and took like 5 min tops. So today  2 21 when my coworkers said they wanted breakfast tacos  I suggested San Juanita s.   My coworker called to place our order and afterwards said the person was rude.   I personally went to pick up the tacos order and I can attest to the other reviews about their rudeness. Specifically the short rounder lady with short hair and wearing red.   I walk in   not greeted  . I stand at the counter and ignored for a few months. I tell her that my coworker called in an order. She tells me it s not ready yet. I stand there because I would assume she would want to take payment. I asked   okay  do I pay  instead of being polite about it  she bluntly states   I ll call you when it s ready  . I tried to say again that I can pay . She says   I ll call you when it s ready  ... okay. I ll sit down and wait.  I kid you NOT  I sit down and 45 seconds later she rings it up and tells me the total... after I just stood there trying to pay  she lets me sits down and immediately after tells me to pay     Like granted it s just a few steps  why couldn t you do that 1 min ago     Not a single smile on this lady s face  como una bruja  I sign the receipt and not tip. She looks at it and throws it in the trash and literally gives me dirty looks all the way until I m in my car.   No way am I going there. There are seriously 30 other places in a 5 mile radius where I can get tacos
San Juanita Tacos,10,Literally best breakfast tacos ever. And the salsa is better than good definitely a 10 out of a 10. They sale the salsa too so definitely recommend taking some home 
San Juanita Tacos,11,I ordered the shrimp tacos and they were tasteless. The tortillas weren t heated up so they fell apart and has no crisp what so ever. The rice was ice cold. I also used the bathroom which was filthy  They say a bathroom resembles a places kitchen and that really terrifies me especially with this corona virus. The toilet didn t even flush  and it has brown stuff all over it kinda like rust  There are so many taco places in Austin and this is by far the worst.
San Juanita Tacos,12,You d expect a down-to-earth establishment like this place to serve authentic cuisine at reasonable prices. Unfortunately  the average-priced food is simply underwhelming  and the service is highly suspicious  bordering on racial profiling.   Food  The breakfast tacos were wholly unremarkable  tiny-but-decent-enough tortillas  exceedingly bland fillings at anemic portion sizes  we ordered egg bean  egg ham cheese  and egg ham   and just one completely flavorless salsa available.  Service  Our server brought us a check that included items we didn t order. The total was  5 more than our actual bill  but fortunately we reviewed the list and caught the error before paying. When confronted  the staff said it was an accident and gave us a corrected bill. I found this to be highly suspicious because my table was one of only three tables at the time of service  and were the only group which did not appear to be Hispanic.  This city is rife with taco joints  so I find it unbelievable that this place is still in business. Save your money and time  and skip this place.
San Juanita Tacos,13,I am tempted to not share how much I loved this place  but I guess that s not fair to the greater Yelping good. A friend recommended the breakfast tacos here  so I stopped by the nondescript location in a gas station strip mall parking lot and was blown away. SUCH flavorful bites in warm  amazing breakfast tacos. Poblano peppers  potatoes  eggs  chorizo...simmered in sauce and love. The servers were very friendly and helpful and the food came out fast.  Sit there or call ahead and take to go. Limited parking in the lot  it fills up fast  people love this place .
San Juanita Tacos,14,LOVE this place  My go to place for breakfast tacos  Always so fast. I got the migas a few weeks ago and have been craving them  The ranchero sauce is AMAZING and the meal it s self is authentic. The staff is also my favorite  Keep up the good work.
San Juanita Tacos,15,Boom  Best Mexican breakfast in S. Austin.  I love the Migas here. I get the Migas especial which includes traditional Migas with choice of meat  the chorizo or sausage are my favorites. It includes tortillas  potatoes that are perfectly seasoned and cooked and refried beans. The red salsa  sauce is amazing and flavorful. Total price less than 8 bucks and you will be full until dinner.  Friendly attentive staff. A great place to try if you haven t been.  Plenty of parking in the rear if the front is full.
San Juanita Tacos,16,I love this place  Great food  Friendly  efficient service  Best Picadillo tacos  I ve been loyal since 1996  and they have as well  concerning their menu and service.
San Juanita Tacos,17,Wow  I was very impressed with this place.  When we decided to go out to breakfast with my daughter and her friend I couldn t figure out why she wanted to go someplace so far away when there are so many places closer. After we got our food I could certainly see why. It was absolutely delicious  reasonable prices  good portion  great service. It was really hard for me to not get Migas because that s my favorite breakfast whenever I come to Austin for a visit but I saw that they had Nopalitos on the menu so I couldn t resist and I wasn t sorry. It s pretty hard to make beans distinctively good but somehow this place does it. I just kept eating those beans until they were all gone. In fact I don t think I had any leftovers at all but my daughter gave me hers since she figured she was going to be too busy wrapping up the school year to have time for leftovers. I enjoyed them the next day. There are many good places to choose from in Austin but I hope I get back to this one another time while I am in town.
San Juanita Tacos,18,Very boyfriend and I come here every week for breakfast  Their tacos are super yummy and they have great prices  I m surprised by the reviews that say poor customer service  because even since the first time I ve been impressed by how great their customer service is  I love love love this place and look forward to coming here every week. Since moving to Austin it s my favorite taco spot. If you re looking for authenticity and delicious food  come here  You can t go wrong here.
San Juanita Tacos,19,You ll find us at San Juanita s at least once a week. The food is plentiful  delicious  and the ranchero sauce is out of this world. The thing that brings us back is the staff though. The service is attentive without being intrusive. After just few visits the team knew us and our drink orders. They get really busy on the weekend so we try to get there by 9am. They are not open for dinner  breakfast and lunch only. I really love that it is always a diverse crowd.
San Juanita Tacos,20,First visit at restaurant ...ordered beef enchiladas and crispy beef taco plate  1 on lunch menu...very good and generous portion of beef filled enchiladas and taco...probably best ground beef in a mexican restaurant in some time..very flavorful...could have had more chili gravy and cheese...crispy taco wasn t saturated by beef grease and didn t fall apart. Salsa bowl was small but salsa had some heat which is somewhat unusual...some places have to cater to yankee gringos so as not upset their sensitive palates...All in all was a good meal...wish they d offer some better tortilla chips...
San Juanita Tacos,21,Delicious. I got a barbacoa taco and the meat was so tasty  a lot for a little taco  and not greasy at all. Same with the spinach and egg taco - they used fresh  not frozen  spinach - a nice touch.  Variety. There were a lot of different dishes available. I found this to be a pleasant surprise especially for a smaller place.  Chips. They were a little meh  but the sauce was definitely a very nice flavor - not vinegar-y at all.  Overall  a good find.
San Juanita Tacos,22,Best greasy spoon taco shop I ve been to. The prices are right  the food is fresh and the service is warm and friendly. The moment you walk in  the amazing smell of meats  toasted corn and spices envelop your senses. The dining room is cheery and colorful and kinda feels like a family breaskfast room. A must stop whenever I m in the Austin area.
San Juanita Tacos,23,This place took way to long to bring our tacos  Then when we finally did get our tacos they weren t what we asked for  Mind you the place isn t even busy  If you want good Mexican food this place is definitely NOT THE PLACE TO GO TO
San Juanita Tacos,24,Too bad this place is so far south. I live in north Austin but drive down to San Juanitas 3-4 times a month. I ve only eaten their breakfast tacos and they are very good. Other items on the menu look good  too. Good prices and good food. I ll try something different at some point  but until then I ll keep making the long trek south for the breakfast tacos.
San Juanita Tacos,25,Amazing customer service. Food is always fresh and the breakfast tacos are to die for  I would recommend the bacon  egg  bean and cheese  I ve been eating here for the past 20 years and the tacos have constantly tasted great  if your looking for a breakfast spot in South Austin I would highly recommend 
San Juanita Tacos,26,Great spot for breakfast or lunch. There micheladas are pretty good as well. Definitely recommend this place.
San Juanita Tacos,27,Great early morning and lunch spot    WONDERFUL service - Marisela - totally delightful
San Juanita Tacos,28,good food for good prices  and they always play good music.  Sometimes they give out free cake on holidays    mmm que rico
San Juanita Tacos,29,BEST TACOS EVER   Big  tasty  cheap. The line is long but it moves fast and the service is great. 10 10 recommend
San Juanita Tacos,30,Excellent  Had the migas breakfast tacos  flavorful  delicious salsa  very tasty  We were looking for a quick bite in the neighborhood  and this was a great random stop in. Great service too.
San Juanita Tacos,31,BEST migas breakfast I ve had in Texas    There s nothing else to say. Can t wait to come back to Austin and eat here again.
San Juanita Tacos,32,I usually have a good experience here. I don t recall names  but I like it here. Reasonable prices  good customer service  and good food. I am well aware of the hours  demand  busyness of the breakfast traffic  and cooking time. I ve been trying to call in an order for more then 20 minutes. Sometimes the call is busy and sometimes it rings and rings and rings and rings. This happens quite a bit when I call in.   I have great customer service when I go in and sit down. The to go orders is what gets me. I ve seen it when it has been busy  i see that the employees work hard. They even answer the phone when they are checking someone out on the register. So I m little discombobulated why this phone call thing is an issue.  Taking in a to go order takes less then a minute.  I am okay with waiting for the food. I am frustrated that the phone hasn t been answered. Calling in an order is very convenient for me in the mornings. Again  I am usually very satisfied here. I ll be taking my business elsewhere this morning.
San Juanita Tacos,33,Tried several breakfast tacos. Great flour tortilla and really good fillings. The salsa was really good too. Super friendly staff. Worth a visit when you crave a tasty quick bite.
San Juanita Tacos,34,The ground beef looked and tasted like something over than beef. It had the texture of canned dog food. The staff was rude  and I will never go again.
San Juanita Tacos,35,This place is great. It s very simple  straightforward Mexican. My husband and I ordered the migas  queso  and lemonade. The migas were really good. Very authentic migas  i.e. not drowning in sauce and queso. The queso was the yellow kind. Very tasty  but super liquidy. The lemonade was awesome. They make it fresh  and it had the perfect balance of sweet and tart. Great service too.
San Juanita Tacos,36,The best breakfast tacos . Potato   egg   amp  white cheese on corn tortilla is my favorite . Oh and the hot sauce that comes with it  is so spicy  good  
San Juanita Tacos,37,I love this place so much  Such genuine  friendly people  The food is always fresh and tasty  and their barbacoa and chorizo are the best in town  lots of flavor  moist but not greasy . Feels so good to support a local family business 
San Juanita Tacos,38,Best tacos I ve ever eaten  and I ve eaten LOTS of them across Austin over the past 33 years .  The Gringa and Grilled Fajita tacos are to die for.  If I m on death-row and have a final meal request  San Juanita s tacos will be on my list 
San Juanita Tacos,39,Their barbacoa and egg taco is one of the best tacos in town. The service is fast and friendly  and I just love this place.
San Juanita Tacos,40,Visiting Austin we were lucky to find this place for breakfast.  We both had wonderful filling meals of eggs with..... stuff.   I m not sure what I ate  but the eggs were provided on a bed of tortilla chips soaked in sauce.   Beans  avocado and more.   The waitress was helpful in choosing our meals.   The restaurant was clean and bright.   I feel lucky to have found it.
San Juanita Tacos,41,I had the breakfast tacos here. Ordered the sausage  potato  and egg. Solid    Terribly hot inside. I felt like I was cooking and not the food.   Also  cleanliness doesn t seem like a priority because it s pretty dirty. I m not sure how I feel about coming back due to the cleanliness issue.   They do have other breakfast options if breakfast tacos are not your thing.
San Juanita Tacos,42,Best breakfast tacos  EVER   Best local joint in the south Austin area to order ahead and swing by to pick up breakfast tacos.
San Juanita Tacos,43,Went here for lunch because of the ratings and the fact that it was right down the street from the seminar I am at.  I have a rule about ethnic food.  If there is no one of that particular ethnicity at that restaurant.  I become suspicious.  I was the only white person in the restaurant when I went in.  This built my confidence.  The server was fast and friendly  which was good because I was on a bit of a time crunch.  The only reason I m docking this restaurant at all is because the salsa was a little over pur ed.  I m not a fan of chunky salsa  but I also don t care for liquid.  Aside from that the flavor was good  and it had solid spice. I ordered the crispy chicken taco plate  because I figured it would come out fast.  I wasn t wrong.  The service was fast  the food was hot and the tacos were excellent.  I would recommend this place to anyone.  Also the price for 3 tacos was more than reasonable.  I left a big tip  and now a good review.  This place is worth a visit.
San Juanita Tacos,44,Love the brisket and rice tacos  Pretty much all the breakfast tacos are really good and the main reason why we come here for breakfast multiple times a week.   Tortillas are not fresh but the food itself makes up for it. Salsa is really spicy but good if you can handle it.   Oh and make sure you sit by the AC if you want to eat comfortably.  Its really hot in there otherwise 
San Juanita Tacos,45,This place is upsetting... I ordered 2 bean and cheese tacos with napales and my total came out to 6.80  Talk about jacked up prices... They then tried to charge me a dollar for cilantro and onions... Bringing the total up even more... I was mind blown since these tacos aren t even that great... The tortilla was soggy  the women were rude when I told the I didn t want to pay a dollar for cilantro and onions  2 of the cheapest things at the grocery store ... Seriously though... Almost 7 dollars for 2 half assed bean and cheese tacos with cactus is a complete joke. I m never going back... There are better tacos for better prices almost anywhere else nearby. Chapala or Casa Maria... Well pretty much anywhere but this place.
San Juanita Tacos,46,We went for breakfast.  Ordered the chips and salsa  coffee  water  and two menus as soon as we arrived.  Did the waitress tell us that the chips and salsa cost  2.50 before 11 am   Nooooooo.  Service was slow  coffee was cold  and chips and salsa weren t that good.  We ordered the Migas Especiales with beef fajita meat.  Reviews made it sounds really good.  Noooooo.  Not much egg  most chips  sauce  and overcooked veggies.  And instead of putting the fajita meat on the side it was chopped up and put in the migas.  If it had any flavor before that  it lost it in the cooking of the eggs.  Second round of coffee arrived  and at least it was hot.  All in all  I m not sure why people say this place is great.  I found it to be barely acceptable.
San Juanita Tacos,47,Extremely unprofessional  I went in there to pick up an order. She said that she did not have an order in that name and started to help the next customer. Horrible customer service  When I asked if someone else was going to take my order because I was there before that customer she said no and told me to leave  I will never go here again and will make sure everyone knows how rude they are  
San Juanita Tacos,48,We live nearby so we are at this place every weekend  but I d probably drive to get these tacos even if we weren t close. The service is casual and very friendly  coffee is decent  and the tacos are on point. My go-to is the beef fajita with nopalitos or the migas especiales. The potatoes and beans that come with the breakfast plates are great.   When it s busy the tacos are very good  when it s slow the tacos are GREAT. The salsa has a nice kick and the food is never undersalted or bland. We always take visitors from out of town here because it has a great atmosphere and is very consistent. We don t bother with  brunch  places anymore when we can just go to San Juanita s. The younger guy that always waits on us is very sweet and often remembers our order. Even when we move  this place will always be a great memory for us. We have a large group of friends in the neighborhood and this is our version of Monk s from Seinfeld. Great spot 
San Juanita Tacos,49,Super sad as I drove up the place was closed. Luckily  they only moved and they didn t close down    They are now at 4406 S. Congress. I love their breakfast tacos  Soooo good 
San Juanita Tacos,50,We love this place and we ve been eating here or getting take out for many years. Their new location is the nicest yet. The hot sauce is addictive. The prices are very reasonable and the staff is the friendliest you re find.
San Juanita Tacos,51,Been here about 4 times now for breakfast.  Service is friendly and prompt.  The food is good and generous portions  they use real eggs and fresh nopales.  The salsa they bring with the meal tastes fresh and mild heat. The tortillas are store bought and steamed or micro-waved not griddled. Soda is by the can  no refills.  Coffee is weak.  Hot chocolate is good.   This time around our booth had food on it  not clean and the salt and pepper shakers were disgusting.
San Juanita Tacos,52,Only been for breakfast.  They have a bigger selection at breakfast than most places.  They offer beef fajita and egg so that is a winner for me as I do not eat pork.  So getting the offer of beef at breakfast is all the better.
San Juanita Tacos,53,Moved out of my hood 11 years ago and still come back to San Juanita s. They have one of the best Fajita with beans  jalape o and onion taco  THE BEST   
San Juanita Tacos,54,I love the service here firs time and John was great great food great atmosphere  and good prices
San Juanita Tacos,55,Amazing food  fantastic service   I always call ahead  and the order is always correct and delicious   This is the Enchiladas lunch special  no veggies. Fantastic  
San Juanita Tacos,56,I had been going here for years but the last time I visted the customer service was unbelievably horrible. They lost my business forever  I will never step foot in that facility.
San Juanita Tacos,57,I ve only had their breakfast tacos and they are Y U M M Y  I ve ordered the chicken fajita tacos which are to die for  bean and cheese taco which is good  and egg  cheese  and potato. They sure do over do it with the eggs on these tacos. They put mountains of eggs on the tacos and only small amounts of potato or meat. But they are still good. Wish they had more sauce other than red. They should look into getting green sauce. Service is OK. The Mexican chick at the counter can be pretty short sometimes. Like I went in today and bought a couple of chicken fajita tacos. When it was done she just flopped the bag on the counter and turned away. The other lady doesn t even speak English of course but she s nice. I plan on going back for their lunch menu and trying some enchiladas some time soon.
San Juanita Tacos,58,I ve been eating breakfast tacos from San Jaunitas for almost 20 years now  They have the best breakfast in south Austin  To be honest I ve never eaten lunch or dinner there just breakfast  Even my wife of 3 years who moved from Leander to south Austin loves the breakfast .....reminds her of her mother s 
San Juanita Tacos,59,Best barbacoa ever  Coffee is very good. Waitstaff is ok. Ordered a menudo to go I ll let ya know.
San Juanita Tacos,60,if you want fresh tacos and hearty quesadillas  with the power to mend broken hearts  cure hangovers  and soothe any cravings of the stomach and soul  this is the place for you. the service was wonderful  the flavors were fresh  the portions were just goldilocks right and there s plenty of parking in this complex  the breakfast tacos were soft and warm and fresh and i added poblano peppers on  got the chicken quesadilla with a side of guac. highly recommend the tacos - we ate them faster than you can say guacamole.
San Juanita Tacos,61,Vegetarian-friendly  reasonably priced  served by friendly and helpful staff.   We went for breakfast on a Saturday morning. The server was friendly and helpful. The salsa was yummy. Between the two of us  my husband and I tried these tacos  migas  ranchero potatoes  nopalitos and spinach  amp  mushroom. They were all excellent and well seasoned. Coffee was perfectly adequate. The servers all help lookout for each other s tables so drinks stay full. I would definitely go back.    The address on Google listed the 5000 block of S Congress but it s actually 4619 S Congress  in a strip center on the corner of S Congress and Sheraton. 
San Juanita Tacos,62,We drive by this place all the time - it s on the southeast corner of Stassney and Congress.  The exterior yellow paint looks like it used to be sunshine bright  but has now faded with time.  It appears to be a tiny shack  a step up from a taco stand.  We d always say   One day we ll go to San Juanita - before it gets replaced by an Office Depot.   And so we did.  Upon walking in  we knew we were somewhere special.  It was a bit larger on the inside than appeared from the outside.  The floors were concrete  the tables were covered in colorful oilcloths  and the TV was blasting terrible Saturday morning Mexican game shows - you know  with scantily-clad women doused in foamy soap.  Although most of the customers appeared to be Mexican families from the neighborhood  there was still a diverse clientele.   The menu explained that San Juanita has always been family owned and that the daughters who work there will get to know your name and what you like to order.  It s true - Paloma took our order  and she made us feel as if we were welcomed guests in her home.  The menu was none too exciting - standard tacos  enchiladas  and gorditas  they do serve menudo on Saturdays .  To try one of the more exotic things on the menu  I had the carne guisada - the rice was cooked to perfection  the refried beans were flavorful  but the meat was a bit tough.    I ll go back there  not so much for the food  but for the genuine  family-owned atmosphere.  And the game shows on the TV.   Just kidding.   p.s. they do take MC and Visa.
San Juanita Tacos,63,Out of curiosity  I braved San Juanita  the post-apocalyptic  Spahn Ranch-esque shanty of a place on S. Congress Stassney   thinking there must be a hidden gem in there. No place this scary looking could stay open unless there is something special going on. Well  there isn t  unless it s something I don t know about. Human trafficking  Meth lab  I watch too much Breaking Bad. Anyway  the whole place smells like burned fish--and everything tastes like it  too. Nothing seemed clean. My salsa bowl had crust on it. The salsa was from a can. My glass had a lip imprint on the rim. I half expected a goat to come wandering through the dining room. I played it safe and got crispy tacos  and if they hadn t already absorbed the burned fish bouquet  I would still say they were the worst I have ever had. This is what Tex Mex tastes like in hell.  I did it so you won t have to. Believe me  it s a gift.
San Juanita Tacos,64,Nopalito tacos  No bueno. Migas  I wanted them to be good. I really did. Barbacoa  guess not EVERYONE includes onions and cilantro. My taco looked like a turd in a tortilla.   The service was friendly and fast and the prices were fair.   It s not too easy to elaborate on.   I do think I ll buy tires while waiting on my next taco. Maybe I just got an off day.
San Juanita Tacos,65,Great Austin icon to grab some good food. Really good Menudo. Now located at  4406 S. Congress Ave.  443-9308 M-Sat  6AM--3PM Sun  8AM--3PM
San Juanita Tacos,66,Crap food..  I live nearby and used to go to Villa Mexico all the time. This place I have tried several times. Breakfast tacos soggy potatoes.  Lunch- ask for carne asada  amp  get beef brisket with again soggy potatoes. Dinner-beef enchiladas red sauce nasty super dry bean and rice...  Again each time food is crap... Don t bother..   
San Juanita Tacos,67,San Juanita s  You get 5 stars for being awesome. Having awesome food and for always being open on my way to work for a breakfast stop.   They are open normally from 6am-3pm. They use to have a location in Kyle  TX however not anymore.  I love their taco s I have yet to get a breakfast or lunch plate.  They are very reasonably priced  and I think everyone should at least try them once.   Very friendly staff and their new location is a lot better and more seating.   Now  go get you sum .
San Juanita Tacos,68,Spent a year in south Austin and recently moved to another part of town  and San Juanita will easily be the south-side restaurant I miss the most.  This place is so very much the real deal . Co-located in a state inspection   body shop  the building is covered with ridiculous lo-fi murals - I can t decide if the frog strangling the crane  the arm-less woman in front of Niagra falls  or the Butt-Head-style rendering of Willie Nelson is my favorite.  Charming servers bring you luscious staples -- Huevos Divoricados is my favorite  complete with a large slice of candied ham. The guisada lunch special  or the adobo pork ... both have a special place in my memory. Right up there with the cacophonous Mariachi band that graced the place on Mother s Day   Great place  I look forward to visiting again when I have occasion to be down south.
San Juanita Tacos,69,Called in the order beforehand since we were in a huge rush really early in the morning. Waited a few more minutes once I arrived. Cheap tacos  pretty good.
San Juanita Tacos,70,First time  great place   We had take out delicious breakfast tacos  Nopalitos  chorizo  potatoes with eggs  pancakes  and French toast. The food tasted the way my mother made it.  Good friendly fast service  good food portions  reasonable prices  clean well lit eating area. One can see this is a family friendly place  the place was packed with a stead line of people picking up food.  I live near by and now I can see why the parking lot is always full. Only problem I have is they are open Monday - Saturday 6 - 3 pm  Sunday 8 - 3pm and I work till 5 week days  but I will find away to stop by on weekend to try out the other dished. Second time doing a review  wish the owner and her group a long good future.
San Juanita Tacos,71,We were looking for a good breakfast place. He wanted pancakes and I wanted a good breakfast regardless of where what. Yelp showed hill cafe had 3 stars and I trust us yelpers so I saw San Juanita s had a better rating and we opted for more stars than pancakes. Guess what  Juanita s had pancakes and french toast   We were happy about that. So I ordered the Mexican taco and poblano taco with a side of French toast and he order a couple tacos and pancakes. We were pleasantly surprised at how good all of our food was. And the salsa was really good too.
San Juanita Tacos,72,Great place to stop in for reasonably priced breakfast tacos  2 for around  4 . The lady at the front was very nice and I got my tacos in minutes. The migas and bacon egg were very good. Just wish the salsa was a bit spicier and that the tortillas were homemade. Can t wait to come back and try more tacos 
San Juanita Tacos,73,Meh. Decent pastor  soggy migas  bad coffee  watery queso.. Not terrible  but I wouldn t go back. They should probably invest in central AC.
San Juanita Tacos,74,The BEST place for authentic breakfast tacos. Get the chorizo with egg and potato - you won t regret it.
San Juanita Tacos,75,The wait staff is always very welcoming and happy to serve. The barbacoa tacos and coffee  are the best  Excellent breakfast place 
San Juanita Tacos,76,By FAR the best breakfast tacos in Austin. I drive from Georgetown every Sunday just for these tacos they are THAT good.
San Juanita Tacos,77,San Juanitas is amazing. They have the best breakfast tacos in Austin  I never have a bad experience. Staff are nice. Tacos are fantastic and its just an all in all good place. Family owned and operated.
San Juanita Tacos,78,This place is horrible. The food is gross. Been there once and will never go back. Horrible service too
San Juanita Tacos,79,I ve been coming here for years and they never fail to serve only the best. I often get breakfast tacos for my employees and they love knowing the tacos are coming from sanjuanitas. Plus the service is amazing. I m always greeted with a smile and my coffee never runs low.
San Juanita Tacos,80,I love San Juanitas   I always get the bacon  egg  and cheese. They aren t incredibly friendly but that s not a big issue for me and the lady at the front is usually pretty busy.   I recommend calling in your order ahead of time and they re usually ready in 10 mins. The food is great  the salsa is nice and hot  and prices are low. I just wish they were open later.
San Juanita Tacos,81,I too have drove by this place an uncountable number of times without stopping. I love little hole in the wall mexican restaurants. My husband on the hand who btw is mexican thinks they re dirty and I m just a strange white girl who likes going into these places. However we went to San Juanitas and it even got his approval  In fact I can t even mention their brisket  amp  rice tacos without him insisting we go get like 6 of them  They are delish  They consider them spicy on the menu  but you can handle it  I ve also had there enchiladas also delish  So next time you re craving some wonderful greasy tacos head down to San Juanitas  the little yellow building next to the old tire store. Call ahead if you d like to indulge at your home.
San Juanita Tacos,82,Excellent breakfast tacos. I usually get the potato  egg and chorizo but my dining companions have been equally pleased with their selections. What really makes it is the salsa  though  which is both spicy and flavorful.  I get sick of glorified tomato sauce. 
San Juanita Tacos,83,I went to this restaurant for breakfast and had some really good Chiliquiles  Not as good as back home but still some really good ones  Will be back again if I am in the neighborhood 
San Juanita Tacos,84,I lived in Austin a few years back and this place was the bomb.  It has changed a little over the years still a hole in the wall.  The hot sauce is the bomb  They also scramble the eggs together with the  bacon and potatoes on the breakfast burritos.  Stop by every time I am in Austin.
San Juanita Tacos,85,San Juanitas is delicious  Their old little shack was demolished and they moved a little North on Congress  just past Hills. Their breakfast tacos are great and always make Sunday mornings easier  I have been eating here for two years and don t plan on changing that anytime soon  Yum FYI  They only take credit cards for orders over either  5 or  10
San Juanita Tacos,86,These tacos are unreal. And so reasonably price. Customer service could be improved  but they are always so slammed  I understand why it s hard to build a personal relationship with your to go guests. I also wish they were open later. 
San Juanita Tacos,87,San Juanita get s 4 stars only because they do not have agua frescas but they have everything else  good flavor  decent price  clean  bilingual  fast service  and quality sized tacos.  Beans are on point   The enchiladas are worth a try and will not disappoint but if you are looking for a good breakfast taco than look no further.  Tacos we have ordered at San Juanita  fajita and bean  napales and bean  chorizo bean and bacon  brisket and bean tacos.  We have been eating at San Juanitas for a little over 3 years now.  Worth a try if you are ever in south Austin.  Come early because unfortunately they close at 3 p.m. everyday.
San Juanita Tacos,88,Good and CHEAP   I live right around the corner and I go here a lot. The migas here sooooo good. They re full of not just eggs  cheese  and chips but peppers and jalapenos and I like to mix a little of the beans in there. Breakfast tacos are very good. Tortillas are soft  not stale like some taco joints by my job that shall remain nameless. Barbacoa was very tender  egg n bacon taco is always outstanding  and the salsa is great. Some folks say the salsa is inconsistent here and I will agree with that but in a good way. I kinda like that some days it s garlic-y and some days more spicy  if it s different all the time then to me that means they re churning out fresh batches all the time. I don t eat manudo my brain can t get behind the idea of tripe  but my Dad loves it at San Juanita s they make it fresh every Sunday and when he gets it I usually have some of the broth because it s so good. My ONLY complaint  and I hate to do it because I love these girls that work here they re friendly  they tolerate my flirting  and they re bilingual for my non-espanol speaking puerto rican ass  but OMG this place needs help with the coffee. It s ditch water coffee. It s baaaad. HOWEVER  I do live around the corner just a 5 min walk so the ladies always let me bring my home made cafe con leche in here to drink with my own mug. I think they know how bad the coffee is lol. Other than that it s a great place with awesome tacos that are really cheap.
San Juanita Tacos,89,I may not know authentic mexican  but I know GOOD and this place has some good food 
San Juanita Tacos,90,Called ahead for a large  short notice taco order and they had it done in 20 minutes. Tacos were delicious and saved me so much time 
San Juanita Tacos,91,Love it  I just moved here from Boston and after hearing from many people and reading other people s reviews of this place I had to try it out. First thing I tried were the lunch tacos with guacamole and they were amazing. I tried the breakfast tacos another day and they were the best around  Since I moved here I have tried as many breakfast tacos as I could and so far they have the best   I got the migas and the barbacoa tacos. If anyone is looking for an amazing tacos look no further then San Juanita s 
San Juanita Tacos,92,Great place for lunch and cheap  Tacos are filling and the service is fast.
San Juanita Tacos,93,one of my favorites places  lenque  rice and  brisket  carne g tacos
San Juanita Tacos,94,This little shack is right by my apartment and I always go there the morning after a long night of drinking.  I really like the breakfast tacos  but I have found them to be extremely inconsistent. Their salsa  is hot sometimes  and then extremely mild and bland sometimes.  The people there are extremely friendly and I would suggest going their if you live close and want breakfast tacos.
San Juanita Tacos,95,Was in the area so tried some breakfast tacos. They were fine but not good enough to make me go back. Had the migas taco and the mashed potato cheese taco. Both were okay as was the  Salsa.  Too many better places around for me to give anything more than 3 stars.
MaCoco,1,Visited Ma Coco on a cloudy Wednesday for ladies happy hour and I absolutely loved it  The only reason I m not giving it five stars is because the food was a bit cold once it reached our table. However  all the food  including the three different salsas  the chips  the burrito  and the cocktails were all freakin delicious  I ll definitely be going back with friends for a HH dinner situation.  First  I love the SoCal aesthetic and menu - nothing like a bomb burrito filled with French fries and guac. Yummm. Those are definitely difficult to find in Austin. In fact  I don t think most people know what they are  or care lol . However  it is a bit strange that this is street food served in a really neat manner   15 for the California burrito . This is all stuff I d grab from a food truck or taco stand. I know it sounds like I m complaining  but I m not lol. I m happy it exists  Especially when everything was tasty and flavorful. Just thrown off by this new wave of SoCal cuisine lmao.  Anyway  shout out to all the wonderful staff who made sure we were taken care of all evening - they were on top of it  See you soon  Ma Coco.   
MaCoco,2,Came across this  hidden in plain site  restaurant last week. I had a short break and was not very hungry but wanted to try them out.   I ordered the Ahi Tuna Tostado. It was the most amazing thing I have tasted in quite a while. Generous slices of raw Ahi Tuna with avocado salsa and salsa negra on a crispy tortilla. Exquisitely good  So good I didn t take a photo till halfway through...  I had to go back again to try more the following day. I ordered the Emoladas. Chicken enchiladas smothered in a Mole sauce. The mole sauce was very tasty reminiscent of visits to interior Mexico. The shredded chicken was a little bland. I think this dish could be perfected if the chicken was tossed in mole sauce prior to being rolled into enchiladas. Mole inside and out.  I will be back to try more 
MaCoco,3,So this was a very lack luster experience.. the ambience is nice but the food and drinks are underwhelming. We started with guacamole . It tasted flat which is interesting for guac  never knew that was possible  and they only gave us like a small scoop of it for  10.00. I ordered the surf and turf quesadilla... they didn t bother to crisp the outside at all and I ended up just eating the inside of the rubbery quesadilla. The inside consisted of mostly onions  but the potential was there.  Lastly I ordered the spicy watermelon margarita and it was mostly juice . Scratch that. I don t think they put any alcohol in the beverage.  As someone who frequents California  I would say skip this place because what you pay is not equivalent to the quality of the food   However.... Ma coco has potential to be a big hit if they put a lot more care into the dishes they prepare and serve up some Texas size portions. Even a third of a texas size portion would do in comparison to their current appetizer portions.
MaCoco,4,I ve been to Ma Coco twice - once for a girl s night happy hour and the other for date night  and it was great both times  They have a pretty decent happy hour menu  and the fish taco on there was a good size. I got 2  but probably would have been fine with 1 after the chips and salsa. The second time I went  I got the soup  and it was perfect on a cold  rainy  winter day 
MaCoco,5,The place for starters is super cute never been to a Baja   La Paz  mexico  inspired restaurant before  we had a michelada  tostada de ceviche and chilaquiles and everything was amazing  authentic and Mexican  our least favorite to keep it real was the churro doughnut  don t get me wrong it was great just didn t taste like churro to us. Carolina helped us out and her service was impeccable too. Amazing place 
MaCoco,6,I loved this place so much I went twice in 2 days   First  the restaurant is so cute. What a hidden gem. Very Cali  modern and great decor. Staff is very nice and accommodating  big table of 12 people unannounced and it worked  even though the place got super packed an hour later .   The food is really good and the prices are fair. I had the  14 California burrito and loved it  Who would have thought to put fries in a burrito  Californians I guess. Sign me up.  Appetizers   The appetizer sampler was disappointing  3 tiny small sauces  I wouldn t get it again.  The guac was good  not outstanding for atx The fries with meat... yum  Get that     A friend got a special salad and it was HUGE  Someone else was a little disappointed in the flautas  so maybe avoid. But why would you even get the flautas to start   The marg was also very good    10 for a marg  seems fair for that side of town.   Overall  I personally love this place and will be back.
MaCoco,7,Went for a early dinner on 7 2 22  The place is on the small side but is very nice inside. The staff was great. I personally thought the menu was a little to small for my liking. I do not eat Mexican very often and did not see much besides a Taco that interested me. My family all got food that they really liked. The chips and salsa was a hit with all of us. They will give you more chips if you ask. My taco was not very warm but was good. I ate a few pieces of fajita meat from my sons plate and it was very good. I would get that the next time for sure. It is the most expensive thing on the menu.   Save some room for the donuts. They are delicious.
MaCoco,8,The wait staff is phenomenal. Super friendly and amazing service. The food is pretty tasty.  Starters   Loaded Fries - 3 5  Tacos   Nopal - 4 5 Shrimp Gobernador - 4 5 Ensenada Fish - 5 5  Dessert   Churro Donut - 5 5  The churro donut is an absolute must order. It s amazing  Fish tacos were super tasty. Nopal taco was okay. Sweet flavor. The shrimp was okay as well. Disappointed with the fries. They came out cold and the carne asada was over cooked  too chewy. The flavors were good though. Our waitress was phenomenal. Great place  Definitely will be back to try the carne asada burrito  the sauce for it looks bomb.
MaCoco,9,Phenomenally great traditional tacos Tijuana style. Great staff and super cool vibe inside. Need to come back after work to enjoy a margarita with my meal.   This will be on my go to list when I m Austin   Greg P
MaCoco,10,Nice local neighborhood restaurant in East Austin. Good drinks  great service and ambiance. Good is also very good  must try the octopus taco and fish s tacos  good flavor and taste.
MaCoco,11,Visit day  05 06 2022  A little backstory before the review  almost every Friday two friends and I get together for dinner in something that has already become a tradition since the beginning of 2020  we like to call it  Fine Dining Friday  FDF   on this occasion we were very excited to visit this Mexican inspired food restaurant based on Yelp reviews and because it is located in East Downtown Austin where most businesses usually leave a good impression  unfortunately our visit had a very bad experience based on the next   - The restaurant  although it is in a good location  was clean and has good lighting  the noise level in the environment is too high to be able to carry on a normal conversation while eating  it is also worth noting that the A C system during our visit was not working  that coupled with the humidity of the Austin climate  even at night  caused one of my friends to have to leave the restaurant for a moment to get some air.  - The quality of the food was excellent  very good flavor although the service time took too long during our visit.  - The service rescued the night what could had been to be a total disaster  the quality of care despite not having enough staff  something already common in Austin  was very good.  - The price was in the range of average restaurants in East Austin although the portions were small.  Un poco de historia antes de la rese a  casi cada viernes nos juntamos a cenar dos amigos y yo en algo que se convirti  ya en una tradici n desde inicios del 2020  le llamamos Fine Dining Friday  FDF   en esta ocasi n nos encontr bamos muy emocionados de visitar este restaurante de inspiraci n en comida mexicana basado en las reviews de Yelp y por que se encuentra en la zona Este del centro de Austin donde la mayor a de negocios por lo regular dejan una buena impresi n  desafortunadamente nuestra visita tuvo una muy mala experiencia basado en lo siguiente   - El restaurante aunque se encuentra en una buena locaci n  estaba limpio y tiene buena iluminaci n el nivel de ruido que encierra en el ambiente es demasiado alto para poder llevar una conversaci n normal mientras se come  tambi n cabe destacar que el sistema de A C durante nuestra visita no se encontraba funcionando  eso aunado a la humedad del clima de Austin aun siendo de noche provoco que uno de mis amigos tuviera que salir por un momento del restaurante a tomar un poco de aire.  - La calidad de la comida fue excelente  de muy buen sabor aunque el tiempo de servicio tardo demasiado durante nuestra visita.  - El servicio fue lo que pudo evitar que la noche terminara siento un total desastre  la calidad de la atenci n pese a que no ten an suficiente personal  algo ya com n en Austin  fue muy buena.  - El precio se encontraba en el rango de la media de restaurantes en el Este de Austin aunque las porciones eran peque as.
MaCoco,12,Loved this Baja style gorgeous spot so much  The decor is stunning - takes you somewhere tropical   We went for an early lunch time one weekend right before the crowd and got some stellar service since we were the only two people inside.   Highly recommend the spicy pineapple marg  chile relleno taco  fish tacos and the tuna tostada. Every bite was mouthwatering and I d definitely order everything again.   I need to go back in for their burritos  They look killer.   They re a tad bit pricey but nothing that would keep me from going back.   They have indoor and outdoor seating options. They don t take reservations but I don t think you d need one anyway. Maybe in the evening on a weekend 
MaCoco,13,I ve been eyeing Ma Coco since they opened and just now went. I was surprised that the sunday brunch wasn t crowded- we walked in and were seated immediately. I loved the experience and am looking forward to going back soon.
MaCoco,14,Two words you need to know... WATERMELON MARGARITA   Drinks are amazing and this was a perfect  refreshing summer treat 
MaCoco,15,This is an underrated spot. If your from California looking for some similar Mexican food  this spot right here  The carne asada fries was the best thing I had  My other half had the fish tacos and she loved it. Also some of the best cocktails  they may be a lil light but they still good 
MaCoco,16,Best chips and salsa I ve had. Best burrito I ve ever had. Chips and salsa could have been cheaper but I mean  you get what you pay for.
MaCoco,17,Interesting new spot off of E 6th and Comal. Stopped in for a quite bite over the weekend  was sat quickly. Service was interesting  seems like maybe they don t have their timing nailed down. They were super friendly  but maybe a little overbearing at the beginning - literally asked us if we were ready to order before I was in the seat  and just generally not giving enough time in between breaks. But then when we did order stuff  they didn t come back for a long time and never refilled my water the entire meal. The drinks were good  Cadillac and Paloma pictured  and the carne asada fries were massive   Good amount of meat and toppings - we planned this as an app and ended up full. I ll try it again for a HH before making a final decision on it.
MaCoco,18,Good-ish food when it comes out  if it comes out   absolutely terrible service. Not sure if it was an under  staffed night or what  but it took 20 min to Just get water and reminded them 2x.  And everything from there only got worse.  Was just 3 of us. I never got my dinner so unfortunately I m writing this with only a drink in me and no food to kill my angry buzz.....and gave a  1 tip.  I feel like a B but man  that was just all around not acceptable and no communication- literally they didn t know my food never came out and we got a plate of 7 chips with our  18 of salsa and guac .   Took 2 hrs to get my whole meal that didn t include my dinner so....... Yeah.     Time to order torchys. Stay away unless you are really patient to get your expensive instagram moment.
MaCoco,19,Service was great  food was not. Carne asada was cold and horrible tough. Tasted like it had been cooked days prior and was reheated. Ambiance was fun and trendy  but the food missed the mark.   While more expensive  Suerte down the street is a million times better... if Mexican is your vibe. While hard to get a reservation  you can put your name down. I recommend popping over to Whistlers while you wait  usually 30 mins .
MaCoco,20,Had lunch here today and first I want to say that I absolutely recommend coming here  It s very cute  the inside is bright and light and that have a lot of outdoor seating.   The only reason for my 3 star review is because I feel like they re having some growing pains -- I ll definitely be back and anticipate amending this to more stars  3 big groups all arrived at the same time as my party of 2  and even though they weren t full  the staff and kitchen were definitely overwhelmed. Our food took some time to come out  and they kindly gave us complementary churro donuts for waiting -- which were delicious   my carne asada was over cooked and tough. The guacamole was delicious  but came with far too few chips  they did bring more when we asked . I also got a shrimp taco which was FANTASTIC  though a bit overfilled and spilling out my tortilla.  My dining partner was thrilled to get a california burrito  but agreed it could have been a bit better -- though also said he would be back  And finally  I didn t have a margarita with my lunch  but that would be the true test for a 4 or 5 star review    Overall recommend  a great add to the neighborhood 
MaCoco,21,This was a super cute place found in the side of the town that I have not been to before  I love mole and haven t really been to a lot of places that serves a good one so it was nice to see it as part of the menu. My friend tried the nopal taco so I also got to try it for the first time in my life  shame  because I grew up in a border town . Everything was good except the service was a little slow and I got only rice instead of rice and beans. I assumed that maybe they were out of beans and didn t complain because I like rice anyway but I saw the next table get rice and beans so it was kind of disappointing that they didn t notify or communicate with me. I d happily return though 
MaCoco,22,Having lived in San Diego for college years I always have a yearning for carne asada fries. This place just looks a lot fancier than your traditional Baja California shack. The carne asada fries were great  and we particularly loved the hot sauce which had a unique taste.   Also  they were short staffed but were hustling hard to take orders and bring food to all  definitely a sign that they care about their customers here.
MaCoco,23,Stopped in at 11 30 on Friday. Easy street parking. Place was empty except for one table. The bartender was the only server. A fan was loudly blasting air but still a little warm.   Chose to sit outside. In the shade  even at 92  outside was great. Had a delicious michelada while looking at the short menu.  Was several things I wanted to try but settled on the chile relleno taco and the octopus.    Food came quickly. The relleno taco was just amazing. Nixtamalized tortilla was slightly crunchy  the sauce was a great add on. The relleno was cooked well  not soggy  batter stuck to the chile and a great cheese filling. Very satisfying.  The octopus was cooked right  not chewy. The sweet peppers were a good compliment. The salsa negra was a little funky  but not off-putting. I might try the asada next time.  Service was fast and friendly. Hope they resolve their AC problems soon.
MaCoco,24,Hands down the best spot in Austin. Drinks and food are top notch and the staff is the nicest in the city 
MaCoco,25,Cute new spot. Drinks were very good.   Food  Guacamole - decent  Fish tacos - good California burrito - ok  could ve been more flavorful and the meat could ve been juicier
MaCoco,26,We loved Ma Coco while visiting Austin for a long weekend. Everything we tried was so delicious and the staff was very friendly and attentive. We tried elote asada  carne asada fries  Salsa Verde Enchiladas  the Cool as a Cucumber cocktail  and took a churro donut back to the AirBnb to eat with some vanilla ice cream. Great meal  great atmosphere  can t ask for anything better.
MaCoco,27,The service was good our waitress was named caroline and had radiating happiness they were out of the burrito which we really wanted so that was unfortunate. The tacos were pretty average but the drinks were great 
MaCoco,28,We decided to stop by at this cute spot for a lunch date on a random weekday. We shared the salsa sampler with chips  the taco pulpo enchilado and the ensenada fish tacos. The salsas were spicy enough and oh so delicious. I really enjoyed the amount of octopus in the taco and the flavors were just right. I ordered the Cadillac and thought it was quite watered down by the time it got to our table. The restaurant was pretty empty when we were there so I don t think it was sitting at the bar for a while so it was odd. I d give them another try if I am ever in the area and there s a wait anywhere else  lots of great options close by .
MaCoco,29,I just wandered in because there was no food at the dance establishment across the street. I was very pleasantly surprised. I m not a big fan of tacos but the shrimp taco which my very sweet waitress recommended was out of this world. And it came very fast.
MaCoco,30,Cute restaurant  the interior is fairly small so I would recommend getting a reservation. The food and drinks were great - we got the Classico margarita  the spicy watermelon mint margarita  elote  and flautas. I do wish the menu had a few more options or variety  but everything was delicious.
MaCoco,31,The fish tacos might be the best in town aside from maybe Ensenada. The churro doughnut with the strawberry and fresh cream is so good and picturesque that I forgot to take a picture.
MaCoco,32,We ve gone to Ma Coco for dinner twice and loved it both times. Their burritos are the best we ve found in Austin - in general this is more of a taco town  but Ma Coco s burritos are an exception  The tuna tostada and agua frescas were also delicious. To top it off  the plates look great aesthetically and the atmospheres inside and on the patio are both fun. We certainly plan to come back again.
MaCoco,33,I am shocked by all the positive reviews of this place.   It was extremely overpriced for the serving sizes  the chips and tostadas were stale  and several menu items were out.  I would never go back.
MaCoco,34,I love Ma Coco  Not sure how you can trust these one star reviews. They might have just had a bad day. Ma Coco is authentic  delicious   amp  fun. The best margarita I ve had in a long time  We got the taco gobernador  chille rellano taco   amp  cadillac
MaCoco,35,Terrible.   Smells bad when you walk in.   No AC. No fan. Front door closed.   Ordered fish tacos. Looked HUGE when delivered. Took a bite and found nothing but disappointment. The fish was big because it was 50  batter. Like 3 4 an inch of batter. So much batter that the fish wasn t cooked. Felt queasy a few bites in.   Such a bummer as the location is good and pictures seem delicious.   Do not eat here.
MaCoco,36,This was quite literally the worst experience that I have ever had in a restaurant. We were seated fairly quickly but had not seen the server for fifteen minutes  meaning we were sitting there waiting. Upon ordering and receiving food  I was handed extremely cold food. I didn t make a fuss though. The cherry on top was waiting a whopping twenty minutes to get the staff s attention to pay the bill. Ridiculous.
MaCoco,37,The food was very good but the restaurant is small. When we went last  they ran out of ice and we had to wait over an hour past our reservation. Even with these problems  the waiting staff accommodated us and gave us a lot of complimentary drinks and desserts and apps. Food was excellent but I don t recommend the beef tacos.
MaCoco,38,Chips and salsa were fire  Drinks were fire  Carne asada plate... fire    Everything was fire.
MaCoco,39,Great fish tacos. Lovely ambiance. The spicy watermelon mint marg with Carabuena was fantastic 
MaCoco,40,Enjoyed it for lunch. There is a charge for chips and salsa which normally is an issue but other than that everything was fresh and tasty. The chips are thick and crunchy which I like too.  Service is nice and friendly.
MaCoco,41,The worst dining experience I ve ever had in my 7 years living in Austin.   We made a reservation for 8pm and didn t get seated until 8 45pm. We ordered our food at 9pm and it didn t come out until 10pm. Asked for waters at least four times  but never got them. One of us found a piece of HAIR in our food.   But what made this experience the worst was the lack of service recovery and rude attitude from the manager. She was condescending and acted very inappropriate. When we showed her the hair in our food and explained that this hasn t been the best experience  she replied with  I m not sure what you want me to do  we ve had a busy night . She then brought us some complimentary doughnuts and made inappropriate jokes like we didn t just tell her we were unhappy. I work in the service industry. This type of response from a manager is truly shocking.   This place won t last long.
MaCoco,42,Best Fish Tacos in Austin     They make real Southern California Baja beer battered fish tacos and they are amazing   My wife got the chili relleno and Nopal tacos and absolutely loved them too.  Did I mention Margaritas too    Fish tacos and Margaritas  my new favorite place on the east side 
MaCoco,43,Drinks are good  service is weird - everyone is super nice  but kinda slow. Second time here our app  just chips and salsa  came out at the same time as our meal. Drinks are good  green salsa is good. Tacos and enchiladas are just okay. Refried beans tasted bad which was a bummer because I usually love them. Might be worth stopping in for drinks and maybe apps.
MaCoco,44,I loved their home made tortillas when I first came here about 3 months back. Last night  I had really bad tortillas. It was soo greasy and extremely cheesy. Please bring the old tortillas.
MaCoco,45,Zero stars- I would not recommend eating here. Terrible experience all around- From the awful smell upon entry   like a camp ground bathroom  to lazy staff hanging around the host stand checking social media. The over priced drinks were weak and spilled all over our table with no offer to clean up. We had to ask for fresh water because something was floating around in the glass-  The food is bland  un-inspiring and presented in a half hazard way. Our cactus tacos were plopped down in a plate with barely edible tortilla and the carne asada was so bad we had to send it back and we told the manager that we thought the meat was rancid. They just brushed it off and took it off our bill. Why waste your money here when there are so many good options within feet of this place. The food is certainly not worth it.
MaCoco,46,Underwhelming and overpriced. Cute cafe vibe and cocktails were enjoyable but that s where the fun ends. Food was disappointing and carne asada tasted like low quality taco cabana with little to no authentic Mexican flavors.
MaCoco,47,I really loved the food here  but I have to agree with everyone else- the service is so so bad.   We were the only group in the restaurant  and our waiter spent most of the time sitting at the bar with his friends  which is totally fine had we ordered and received everything.  He took his time taking our orders  making our drinks  seeing if we needed anything else  etc. He forgot one of our friends orders and then brought it out like 30 minutes later when we were all done eating  even though we were the only ones there.   Anytime I suggest coming here for happy hour and tacos  bc I LOVED the food   it seems everyone who has been here has had the same experience and would rather go somewhere else.
MaCoco,48,I actually really loved this place when it first opened about a year ago. I was super excited to come back however the place has REALLY gone downhill. From the weird smell when you first walk in  to the extremely greasy and cheesy tacos  it was just not pleasant at all. I d definitely avoid this place until they get their act back together  so many other lovely places to try in the area.
MaCoco,49,The food is definitely subpar. The carne asada was so overcooked  we couldn t cut through it and the waiter s first recommendation is he d bring us a sharper knife... I m not someone who sends food back but it was inedible. Otherwise  the cocktails were decent.
MaCoco,50,First  I want to say that the service was awesome and the servers are not apart of this review   I came here on a Friday night to grab some drinks early dinner with my boyfriend. We both love Mexican food  him being a native Southern Californian  so we were excited to try it out    I hate giving negative reviews but this might ve been the worst Mexican food I ve ever had. We started out with drinks which were below average. Order some guacamole which tasted like pure lime juice and salt due to the lack of seasoning. Only to end with a shrimp taco that had rubber like unseasoned shrimp and a steak taco that had Taco Bell like overcooked steak. We rushed to eat a few bites and then leave because we felt bad for our server. Overall  the place needs a major revamp because idk what they re serving. The only good thing is the customer service  
MaCoco,51,Not going to lie I m dieting and I was starving when I came here. I always ask for recommendations and the server gave me some good choices. I enjoyed the tuna tostada nice cold fresh tuna and bold flavors. The carne asada taco was good  and the Chile relleno was good  interesting. I didn t know what to expect but it was literally a Chile relleno inside of a tortilla.
MaCoco,52,Great food. The California Burrito is gigantic. Ceviche is good as well  Was impressed by their Michelada 
MaCoco,53,Good but not great. Both my friend and I agreed we won t be back. The tacos we ordered did not come with any salsa strangely so it was missing that kick. While you could tell the corn tortillas were homemade  the tacos themselves were tiny and could have used more vegetables  aside from the fish taco which admittedly was packed with vegetables - good job there . Salsa and chips review  chips were super thick  didn t really enjoy. Ate about 2 and stopped.   Suggest more menu items besides just tacos for now.   Also suggest masks for employees... it was strange that in August  even with CDC guidance now recommending masks in COVID heavy areas due to Delta spread  basically the whole county besides rural areas  amp  most definitely Austin .. none of the restaurant employees were masked. We sat outside which I thought would be OK  but I still felt unsafe due to how close the waitress kept getting to me. Yes  I know masks are not really comfortable  etc. but I was surprised to see a restaurant where the workers themselves were not masked during this challenging time. It s kind of the nature of the work  unfortunately  just like we expect doctors and nurses to wear masks.
MaCoco,54,As a dreaded California transplant I love that someone has brought proper Baja-mex food to Austin. Ma Coco is located off 5th street  right across from the White Horse. This is the family s second location with the original located in Bastrop  which is currently under renovation. Their menu is large enough to have all the things you d want from this style of Mexican food  but not overwhelmingly large. The food is authentic to the point that the owner gets his tortillas for the burritos from San Diego. If you ve ever had a burrito in SD  you know what I m talking about. The perfect tortilla for the perfect Cali burrito.   I always start with the salsa sampler because the salsas are fantastic and the chips are made fresh  in-house. Other item menus not to be missed are the tuna bites on happy hour  the pulpo  octopus  taco  and the holy grail  California burrito. If you re a cali transplant  eat here.   They also have a full bar with a great margarita selection. Everything is fresh  light  and delicious. They have bohemia in bottles and I recommend The Dude.   Go have some good baja-mex to carry you over until you get back to SoCal for your next visit.
MaCoco,55,Sat outside which was nice and they have a nice interior as well. The food was really great  highly recommend the fish tacos. And all the salsas in the trio were very yummy which sometimes is not the case elsewhere. The drinks were ok but the food is what stood out. They are a very new restaurant so the service definitely needs work. We were never served water after asking 3 different people and getting our orders taken was kind of a disaster but we weren t in a hurry and got good food so it was fine. Once they improve the serving I think this place will be closer to a 5 star  
MaCoco,56,Great new local spot  They make the tortillas by hand on site  and they re the best I ve ever had. The food here is really great...but I gotta say  the service is even better. It s a family owned and operated business  and you can tell by the dedication and passion of the folks here.   Definitely a must try 
MaCoco,57,3 if us came here for lunch on. Saturday and the place was empty. We ordered the fish taco  pulpo taco  and chicken flautas. The fish tacos were the star of the show. The portion is generous  tastes fresh  and we can t wait to order it again. The pulpo taco was also tasty  although a little small  although it had a lot of veggies . The chicken flautas we re a total disappointment. The chicken was over cooked and dry - they should figure out how to make it juicier or at least provide a side of salsa. I wouldn t order this again. Lastly  the restroom was a MESS  No toilet paper  the lock didn t work  and it was filthy. I hope the cleanliness of the kitchen is better.
MaCoco,58,Love the aesthetics of the restaurant  The Food never fails to impress and always delicious  Definitely check it out 
MaCoco,59,The complementary chips and salsa  all were fantastic  had the carne asada plate  amp  was soooo delicious. Not to bash on Tex Mex  but coming from California  this is some of the better Mexican food I ve had in the 4 years I ve lived here. I will definitely be coming back soon   
MaCoco,60,The food is delicious. I highly recommend it. Order the Ahi Tuna  Asada Tacos or elote. Those are my favorites. I loves the Carabuena Tequila margaritas too 
MaCoco,61,Don t think twice. Ma Coco is the real deal. In the old location La Matta  this Cali-style mexican eatery is primed for big business with all the apartments and work buildings around. Popped in there today and while they re still on a limited  soft opening menu the owner told us  but the plan is to be full menu in the near future. The build out is beautiful  very clean white and blue vibe  photos of San Diego and Coronado line the wall  and the wood grain feel of the tables bar vibe nicely to give off that beach-eatery vibe.  The tuna tostada was fantastic. Fresh tuna  avocado  a delicious spicy sauce  and some fried julienne cut shallots  I think   on top... it was big time good. I also had the nopal taco which was fantastic. Could use a side of sauce or something  but a spritz of lime did the trick to really bring the flavor fully out.   My co-worker got the battered fish tacos and said they were really good  very fresh  and the batter was delicate  crispy  and all around good. A bit messy to eat  but just hit that Chicago Italian beef stance and you ll be fine.   Excited to see this place thrive and to get the Cali burritos in there and take in a Friday work Cali burrito and michelada s . Until then  we ll be back for the limited menu and will keep enjoying what we re given  5 STARS
MaCoco,62, Hidden gem in East Austin  This is such a cute place  The food is amazing and service is outstanding   Started with drinks.. Cool as a Cucumber and Ma Coco Clasico - outstanding  We ordered the chicken flautas and fish tacos... SO delicious  Everything is made fresh when you order it and you can tell they care about their customers. Great service  great drinks  great food  great environment  Will be coming back very soon    
MaCoco,63,Service was terrible limited drinks  small menu and mediocre food and a premium price.
MaCoco,64,Love this place  Went for a date night and the food was delicious. I loved the civiche. Meredith was the best server ever she was super cool
MaCoco,65,Great new spot that just opened up  Was in town from Idaho visiting a friend and came across this new spot. Place is very inviting and has a great vibe  Sat outside and soaked in the sun and drank margaritas. Great food  great drinks  great new spot to try 
MaCoco,66,I live right down the street so when I noticed this place I was stoked on a new fun neighborhood spot. While the food is pretty good  the service is not. My friends and I went in and asked for the happy hour menu. We ordered drinks and food from the HH menu. When it came time to pay  we were all confused by how high the bill was. It turns out we ordered the regular flautas and not the happy hour ones   She said we got four when the happy hour flautas only come with three.. not sure how we were supposed to know that ahead of time to clarify  I also remember my friend physically pointing to the item on the happy hour menu when she took our order. She was condescending and rude to us when we asked for this to be sorted out. We were scammed  Tricked  Taken advantage of  Not cool
MaCoco,67,Really nice restaurant  Has a great outdoor patio and really nice inside as well  Loved the carne asada fries  Amazing flautas    So good and crunchy  Loved them  Churro donuts are delicious as well. Really friendly helpful staff as well  Great place  We will be back for more flautas
MaCoco,68,Amazing restaurant   Food is phenomenal... I am vegetarian and the staff is always super accommodating. I get the carne asada quesadilla with no carne asada  and of course there are other delicious vegetarian options as well. The quesadilla is just my favorite  The drinks are so tasty  Classico is my favorite  And the staff could not be more kind and fun to be around. This restaurant has great energy with awesome music  ambiance  people  etc. I would recommend to anyone and everyone looking for a delicious Baja Mexican restaurant in Austin  Oh and you must order the churros... they are to die for 
MaCoco,69,So disappointed. Really wanted this place to succeed  but they just keep shooting themselves in the foot. First went to their Bastrop location  and it was good. As a San Diego girl  I was really excited about good SoCal Baja Mexican food  and have told lots of people to try them. We ve driven across town at least three times when their social media website says their open only to find that they re closed.  Like  normal times a restaurant should be open  nothing crazy.  Made a reservation for last night. We were the only people  there except for two people at the bar. Got our chips and guac pretty quickly. The salsa sampler is three tiny  like 2oz each  servings of salsa for  6  which lasts about a minute for four people. Tried to order the carne asada burrito and they said they were out of burrito-sized tortillas. Ordered the carne asada quesadilla instead-it had a couple of pieces of meat. Our friend ordered the carne asada plate. The pile of meat looked like it had been set out in the sun for awhile and was dry and tasteless. He took it home to give to his dog. It was that bad. The service was ok  but our friends who had arrived a few minutes after us finally had to go to the bar to order a drink after waiting several minutes for a server to take their order  and remember  we were the only people in the restaurant.  Sorry to say we re done trying Ma coco. It looks like what we thought were the  new location bugs  are permanent features. There is way too much good Mexican food in this town to serve up subpar food and service repeatedly.
MaCoco,70,I had a cali burrito craving. I almost drove to California to get a burrito but decided I could try a place close to home. Well  I m glad I tried Ma CoCo because the food is great 
MaCoco,71,Highly Understaffed. All of the staff was relatively nice but it seemed that one woman was working hard doing most of the tables while the manager    was just chatting with guests. It took an hour to get chips and salsa out to the table and we had not even been able to order our entrees yet.
MaCoco,72,Went on a Saturday for brunch. Was treated so rudely at the door that i won t ever be going back or recommending this place. No idea how the food is but the person at the hostess stand was nasty. In my two years in Austin have never experienced anyone so rude. Sad.
MaCoco,73,Been here multiple times and have had great food every time  Carne asada fries are my favorite 
MaCoco,74,If you are looking for a place to eat  you MUST try this place. One  it s beautiful  Two  the food is delicious and price conscious  The owners are so friendly and welcoming  You can try everything on the menu and you will not be disappointed. My favorites are the ceviche  taco gobernador  and taco pulpo 
MaCoco,75,Such a cute  fun  clean find  We literally stumbled on to this place and couldn t be happier  The food was delicious  good size  priced low and served quickly.  We had the enchiladas  salsas and quesadilla.  Wouldn t change a thing   Great bar menu as well  Servers were attentive and kind 
MaCoco,76,Came here on a Saturday night for dinner. It s SO pretty on the patio and the inside is soooo cute. Definitely a good spot for a date night. Got the fish tacos and they were great. Lots of flavor. The service was fast and our waiter Javi was friendly. Def going back
MaCoco,77,Super fresh ingredients and bomb house tortillas. We got the elote  carne asada fries  and a few tacos and all were excellent. Excited for this place to join our neighborhood 
MaCoco,78,The Elote is bomb   The owner knows a thing or two about hospitality. He came and chatted with us for a bit and even brought us out something for the table. Thanks for being such a great host 
MaCoco,79,Incredible menu    I ve tried 80  of it and there s not a single  ordinary  dish.   Everything is delicious      The Creative flavor combinations and beautiful presentation make Ma Coco my very favorite Restaurant in Austin       And  the cocktails      HomeRuns  - Every One      The Dude  is awesome 
MaCoco,80,It s newly opened but def worth checking out... so good   Great cocktails  tried their margarita and paloma. Came here after seeing fried fish tacos on Yelp and got those but a sampling of other stuff also. The salsa sampler and guac  chips are so good and different. Ahi tuna tostado was cool and refreshing but had a nice spicy kick. The Mexican street corn also awesome  Didn t get a picture of the tacos but they were perfect. We left feeling so full but not like shit  everything was so fresh and flavorful. Probably one of the best meals I ve had in a while.
MaCoco,81,Ma Coco is such a great addition to the town. The food  drinks  and environment are amazing and The service is even better. If you haven t tried this place yet and be sure to get a marg and the tuna tostada 
MaCoco,82,Unfortunately when we went there they were understaffed so I never got to try the food. We got there around 6pm on a Friday and we re seated. We watched the poor server tending to other guests and we never received any acknowledgement from her. After thirty minutes of nothing we decided to leave. Maybe we will try again in a few months.
MaCoco,83,Adorable atmosphere and good food. I would love to give this restaurant five stars but after my visit today  I feel as though I have been taken advantage of. My group was handed a happy hour menu when we sat down and were told it ends at 6 30. We all ordered items that we saw on the happy hour menu and thought it was very clear we were ordering off of that menu. When it came time to pay we noticed our bill was much higher than expected. Our waitress told us that since we did not specifically tell her which menu we were ordering off of she assumed it was not the happy hour menu and charged us the normal price being  6 above the happy hour price for an item on both menus. When we asked about this she was not friendly or willing to hear us out in regards to our confusion. If you choose support this restaurant during happy hour make sure you specifically state that you are ordering off the happy hour menu or else you will be taken advantage of.
MaCoco,84,I can t say enough great things about this place  this is exactly what the East Side needed. I have been a couple of times and have tried to really explore the menu. It s hard to pinpoint my favorite item because EVERYTHING IS SO GOOD  but here s a couple recommendations to get you started.  All of their drinks are on point  try The Dude  and you cant go wrong with their Ceviche for an appetizer. Also  they have hands down the best Fish Tacos in Austin and you can t leave with out trying the Taco Gobernador. The last time I went in I tried the Churro Donut and that alone will make you come back.  Great place  great location  great vibes  and stellar service. 10 10 recommend
MaCoco,85,Delicious  fresh food. Finally  Mexican food for  foodies  like us. We liked everything we ordered - enchiladas  fish tacos  flautas and churro. Welcome  Ma Coco from CA.
MaCoco,86,My friends and I went to Ma Coco after Ramen Tatsuya was too busy and God are we glad we did  The elote asado was an excellent appetizer  the taco gobernador was delicious  flavorful  and perfectly sized  and everyone who had the enchiladas loved them  Beautiful plating too  If only I d taken a photo. The owner was so friendly and our waiter was great too. Highly recommend  We ll definitely be back soon
MaCoco,87,Absolutely delicious      Owner and staff are incredibly kind and down to earth. We ordered the California burritos  fish tacos  carne asada fries  and the churro donuts. We also had really yummy margaritas  10 10 recommend.
MaCoco,88,Super good spot  Inside of the restaurant feels like Tulum vibes. Definitely recommend checking out 
MaCoco,89,This place is the best in austin. Not only is the customer service exceptional  the food is DELICIOUS. We had the chili relleno taco  california burrito  flautas  to name a few  and we had no complaints. I found this place randomly on Yelp and am so impressed. A must try  
MaCoco,90,Absolutely delicious  We tried a little bit of everything and nothing disappoints. The chips were freshly fried and the salsa sampler was amazing. Elote was perfect and the carne asada fries were delicious  Fish tacos are perfectly crispy. Chili relleno taco was yummy and something I had never tried before. Try the dude spicy pineapple margarita as well. A   on everything 
MaCoco,91,First time in Texas and I came straight here ... let me tell you the drinks were mouthwatering and refreshing the margaritas were amazing I had to try them all. The food if you want a taste of authentic Mexican food come here every bite was bursting with flavor I couldn t put my fork down damn near licked the plate lol DONT FORGET THE CHURRO DONUT FOR DESSERT
MaCoco,92,This is the Mexican food Austin has been missing. Ma coco has only been open for a few weeks and I ve already been 3 times.
MaCoco,93,Great place and vibe. My friends and I found this restaurant as we were driving around. The food was delicious. Definitely recommend the carne asada fries and fish tacos. Great atmosphere with wonderful music. The owner is super nice and checked on us throughout our meal. Overall  great experience 
MaCoco,94,Beautiful space  great food AND super nice and attentive staff and owner. 5 stars all around 
MaCoco,95,Brand new spot and already highly recommend  Got the chips and guac and carne asada fries both were incredibly fresh and sooo tasty  Can t wait to see what more they add to their menu  Highly recommend trying this place out ASAP 
CJs Tacos,1,The birria was flavorful and juicy and and served with a great verde salsa. My only qualm with the food was that I asked for a corn tortillas  for which I had high hopes  and was served lackluster corn tortillas. My reason for the 3 stars is for accessibility. All they had to do was put a small ramp up to the  ordering platform  and use mats to make a path covering the deep gravel that is very hard to push through in a wheelchair. If I drive by in the future and see they have made the space more accessible I will come back and bring my friends.
CJs Tacos,2,I LOVE the tacos here    Discovered on Nextdoor  a neighbor advertised their family s humble taco truck several months ago  but I hadn t stopped in yet... And then La Tunita closed down over the summer  leaving a birtia-flavored hole in my heart.  Fast forward to now  I ve gone to these guys at LEAST once a week for the past 6 weeks or so   They have a large covered on site patio seating area  or will bring your order to your CAR if you re taking it to go    I ve tried the following and it s all delicioso  migas taco  suadero  bistec  birria  quesabirria  consomm   bacon  amp  egg  adobo  chicken.  Pro Note  The red salsa is the spiciest of the 3 they offer  the 2 green are more mild   and I split HALF of the little container across 3 birria tacos  and then add green to it ... Their red is spicier than tacodeli s salsa do a ... You. Have. Been. Warned    P.S. you can ask for a specific salsa when you order  but when I haven t specified  I get only red with the quesabirria.  THANK YOU to these guys for bringing tasty food closer to our Del Valle community   
CJs Tacos,3,Fabulous roadside taco stand. Parking. Tables in shade. Delicious tacos on homemade corn tortillas. What more could you want.  I order Al pastor  quesobirra and the compechanos on the recommendation of the sweet kid working the stand. All were bomb. Al pastor was my favorite.  Salsa was good. Service was fast.  Excellent in every way.   Love a family run home run 
CJs Tacos,4,The Al Pastor taco was the bomb and best one I ve ever had - tender and juicy morsels of pork that explodes with flavor in your mouth. The Suadero was also well seasoned and had a good crunch. The Pescado was a bit bland and subpar compared to San Diego Baja style fish tacos. The Quesabirria lacked a crunchy cheddar crust that I was used to in other taco shops. The consomme was rich and complemented the birria well. The corn tortilla was a bit thicker and larger than I preferred but at least they also filled it with a lot of the meat. 3 tacos is good enough to make a hungry person satisfied. Ask for the super spicy hot sauce  It will make you sweat and gulp down a bottle of soda but it s so worth it.
CJs Tacos,5,We loved CJs so much for lunch  we went back the next morning for breakfast and once again were amazed.   We both had the Migos and I added Chorizo. With or without the Chorizo  they were wonderful    I won t write more here  only want to say give this little taco trailer a try  morning  noon or night.
CJs Tacos,6,Great tacos and the orange sauce is hot  Go easy on it when you pour on it s deceiving but oh so good  Like the pineapple on the chicken tacos.  Tried the beef one too.  All good.  Will be back.
CJs Tacos,7,I really like this place. I m working on a project right down the road  and this place has become my go to taco spot. Their tacos are great  and the read salsa is freaking awesome.
CJs Tacos,8,Great spot and the service is great as well. When the food was ready  I noticed they were exciting the truck and delivering the food either to people in their cars  or at the tables. It s a little thing but I don t see that often  or at all  at places that have the similar type of set up. The food w and fresh and the prices are great 
CJs Tacos,9,Deliciously yummy filling homemade corn tortilla tacos  Migas and Potato-bean with bacon  for  2.99 each     Fresh ingredients  authentic tomatillo salsa and they brought the tacos to my car when my order was ready--that s top notch service  Can t wait to come for lunch soon 
CJs Tacos,10,I went to a nearby auto shop and stopped by here during morning time. Tacos are so fresh and tasty. Al Pastor was so good I can come back again just to have it. Chicken tasted good too and their red salsa is very spicy just another great taco food truck of Austin.
CJs Tacos,11,Absolutely amazing food  great seasonings and amazing service. Best tacos I ve had in Texas 
CJs Tacos,12,This place is legit. Their generous portion of migas tacos will melt your face off but it s worth it. You can text in your order as well.
CJs Tacos,13,That mango with the pico on the chicken taco is the BEST combination EVER  These tacos were so filling and on the way to the airport  so I had to stop by. There s places to park  so that s convenient. Staff was super friendly. If I come back to Austin  I m heading here first.
CJs Tacos,14,Oh my goodness  What a great place to grab a quick breakfast or lunch  quesobirria    The chorizo is perfectly cooked with the right amount of spice.  Don t even get me started on those delicious tortillas and spicy salsas 
CJs Tacos,15,I think this location had previously shut down and then re-opened because I had some friends tell me about it before...  Just recently the food truck is back out there and serving food.  Stopped by and got two bacon egg potato and cheese tacos  they were  2.99 each.  Not the best tacos  but they were pretty good.  I wish It had came with some better salsa or hot sauce to go with it.  Can t wait to see what other kind of goodies I can score of this place.
CJs Tacos,16,Good knight this place was good. Their Birria tacos were absolutely incredible. That s all I got l  but I can t see myself ever ordering anything else. Seriously. This place is legit
CJs Tacos,17,The only reason why four stars is because the food is good.  pricey but good food. Why not five stars this is the second time I go and they forgot an item.
CJs Tacos,18,We sampled almost everything on the menu and they did not disappoint  Each taco was overflowing with meat and toppings. The flavors were amazing. The salsa was on point. The price is great and service was friendly. My favorites were the al pastor and suadero tacos  but all of them were amazing. And did I mention the most delicious homemade tortillas     Highly recommend this place 
CJs Tacos,19,Awesome tacos with great flavor. The staff has also always been so helpful when ordering.
CJs Tacos,20,I just tried CJ s for the first time as I now work close by. I must say  it was love at first bite   I got beans  migas and avocado on corn tortillas. Each ngredient was super tasty and extremely fresh   Shout out for their homemade corn tortillas. They are nice and thin and tasty and have just the right amount of chew and crispness to keep them from falling apart. Their salsas are authentic and if you like it HOT  ask for their hottest salsa. They told me to be careful with it. I was impressed as many  Mexican  places only carry mild to medium salsas. If you want to knock your socks off with flavor and heat  you will be glad you asked for the HOT kind.
CJs Tacos,21,This place is so damn good. I crave it multiple days out of the week but sadly only make it a few times a month even though it s on the opposite side of town from me.
CJs Tacos,22,Authentic and great flavor  Loved it  They weren t greasy and we liked the ones w pineapple in them 
CJs Tacos,23,Super awesome tacos. Birria was worth five stars and the pastor and suadero were worth four. Great service  homemade corn tortillas  well worth a stop.
CJs Tacos,24,Super accommodating service  excellent food  and amazing salsa options. The value for the volume is undeniably good and the taste is a top 5 taco spot in Austin. I ll be back for sure.
CJs Tacos,25,THE BEST TACOS IN AUSTIN TEXAS    Omg they are delicious  Everything is freshly made on spot  The owners are AMAZING  And so kind and sweet  Not to mention the price range is amazing  So cheap and the amount you get is so big   I always have to take a Togo box home everytime  They won t let you leave hungry that s for sure      They also have breakfast tacos that are a size of a burrito and sooo goood  The presentation is amazing  outstanding  Highly recommend 
CJs Tacos,26,CJ s quickly became my boyfriend s and my favorite taco place in Austin after we discovered the brisket tacos and birria. We now pick up CJ s multiple times a week and have even eaten it for lunch AND dinner in the same day because we crave it so often. If I am ever asked what I want my last meal to be before I die it s probably CJ s.
CJs Tacos,27,Loved my vegetarian tacos  I asked him to make them spicy and he delivered with the sauce and tacos. Everything good you read is true. The food  the service and the sauces are amazing   I do wish they had vegetarian friendly beans.
CJs Tacos,28,I haven t had a single thing here that hasn t left me wanting more. Their Birria tacos left me in awe and the breakfast tacos hit the spot every single time. Customer service has always been great here too. Overtook my favorite breakfast taco spot in Austin.
CJs Tacos,29,One of my favorite taco spots ever. I ve been 4 times this week for lunch  tried 4 or 5 different types of tacos and they ve all been great. Price is great and 2 tacos is plenty. Even the presentation is great  definitely recommend you try something new every time.
CJs Tacos,30,The best breakfast tacos I ve ever had. Stopped here after leaving the airport. It was pouring rain  so he brought the food right to our car. I d fly back just for another one of CJ s chorizo breakfast tacos.
CJs Tacos,31,C and J work the truck and the food is awesome.  Their Birria is on point  great local business  support them 
Daygos San Diego Taco Shop,1,I moved from San Diego in 2016 and try as I might  I haven t been able to find a good California Burrito in Austin. Granted  choices were few  but all of the recommended places left me disappointed. Until now.   This place is legit. Tell all your San Diego expats.   The prices will make you gasp  but it s absolutely worth it for the taste of home. I will definitely be back.
Daygos San Diego Taco Shop,2,Been searching for a good place for rolled tacos and this place is the spot. Being an expat of San Diego searching for legit Mexican food without beans is far and few in between. Don t let the prices deter you  I d happy pay to stratify my cravings. Wes is the man 
Daygos San Diego Taco Shop,3,So happy to have found Daygo s   The one and only thing we miss about CA is good carne asada  This is what we ve been searching for in TX over the last 3 years   So delicious  huge portions and great hot sauce too. We ll be back soon 
Daygos San Diego Taco Shop,4,Absolute Fire coming out of this tiny food trailer  ..The guy running it has a passion for the plates he puts out. Located in there new location  at Oskar Blues Brewery Taproom...although the address is listed as Energy drive...there is a small road on Metric that leads you behind the building..look for the Oskar signs and waving banners. Everything is made to order  super fresh ingredients...A buddy who had visited the old location brought me here for the Daygo Fries..we both went with Carne Asada...man these plates are huge..Hot crispy fries with tender Carne  fresh Guacamole  Sour cream  Pico And cheese ...2 types of hot sauces...orange being my favorite this was one killer tray of food..Do yourself a favor and try it you will live it...and support small and local  ...and yes...I ate the whole thing  ..Dang good food 
Daygos San Diego Taco Shop,5,Im not one to leave reviews often  but after trying Daygos  i was simply moved to do so.  Ive been stuck in Austin for a week for work. I live in Dallas  but i am from California  so i am always on the hunt for great mexican food. After searching for burritos on yelp  I stumbled upon Daygos  saw a pic of the asada fries  and headed that way.  I got there on a thursday about 12 05pm  right after he opened. He  i assume the owner  was very polite and easy to talk to. Got a great vibe from him. I ordered my asada fries and he instructed me to go to the website to pay.   Long story short  and the important part of this review... BEST CARNE ASADA FRIES I HAVE EVER HAD  EVER . After seeing the price im not gunna lie i almost cancelled the order  but  everything tasted SO fresh. From the cheese  to the guac  the fries  and most importantly the beef. It definitely was very filling  and overall im glad i stuck with it. Excuse the picture  as i was halfway thru eating when i snapped it.   Reason im only leaving 4 stars and not 5  Number one and main reason  PRICE   20 for asada fries from a small food trailer  plus a mandatory tip of minimum  2  to me is a bit steep. This isnt the state fair  and thats his everyday price. In my opinion the website asking for a tip from a food trailer that doesnt serve food like a restaurant  is strange. That would be my main deterrent from coming back here if i was in town again. Second reason  paying on the website was not very easy or quick. I think if he had zelle   paypal  venmo to send money  that would be much easier.   Overall tho  great tasty fresh authentic food and good service.
Daygos San Diego Taco Shop,6,I d never had San Diego style Mexican food but OmG here we are. Their food is the perfect culmination of flavors and their salsa is to DIE for  and hot as hell . 5 stars for sure.
Daygos San Diego Taco Shop,7,Looking for that Baja style Mexican food perfected in San Diego  look no further.. Been living n Austin 10 years after leaving San Diego and really haven t had a great burrito in that time  until I found Daygos  all the flavors and textures I remembered were there.  I had the California burrito and wasn t disappointed  it was gone before I left the parking lot.  Will be back to try the rest of the menu  Thanks Wes   Only had 2 minor issues  it was a little confusing to find without a street sign on Metric  was impossible to get to from Energy Blvd  secondly  No Jamaica  Get some Jamaica guys  it s a must.  Thanks again 
Daygos San Diego Taco Shop,8,As a born amp raised San Diegan who recently moved to Austin   amp  who had carne asada fries as part of my weekly diet   I was seriously missing San Diego s Mexican food. This came close to scratching the itch  but it was nothing to write home about. What I mainly dock stars for is the absolutely absurd pricing   amp  I see the prices have gone up even further since my visit . You d be completely laughed out of SD if you tried charging  19 for a standard carne asada burrito  amp   20 for fries lol. To put it in perspective  one of the places in SD that gets criticized for being way too expensive still only charges  14 for a Cali burrito  amp  you at least get free chips with that. Here  they couldn t even give us a fork  haha  he made us go ask the bar . But you do you  Texas.
Daygos San Diego Taco Shop,9,Truly enjoyed the carne asada fries  great taste and loaded with steak  The serving is generous and enough to feed two people or share as an appetizer. Great taste and service 
Daygos San Diego Taco Shop,10,Just go  You won t be disappointed. Southern Californian  San Diego  Mexican food. The rolled tacos were excellent and the California burrito was amazing  The meat was dripping with flavor. My husband never eats the whole burrito  but there was nothing left but the wrapper. I never eat 6 taquitos  but I did. I would ve licked the box clean if no one was looking. The owner is a great guy. I ll be back for my roll taco fix next weekend.  Good  good  food 
Daygos San Diego Taco Shop,11,I ve been missing a great burrito and carne asada fries and haven t been able to really find any decent ones in Austin at all until I found Daygos  If you are looking for great California Mexican food  this is the SPOT. Their burrito is one of the best I ve EVER had  my husband LOVES their carne asada fries  and their rolled tacos are also delicious  And the green salsa is so flavorful  it is a must try  The owner is also really nice and genuine. We will stop at Daygos every time we are in this area of town   
Daygos San Diego Taco Shop,12,These are the best Carne asada fries I ve had since moving from CA. It s a little on the pricey side but still better than most I ve had here in Austin
Daygos San Diego Taco Shop,13,Every-time i come to ATX I m definitely pulling up.. the chicken was delicious and the fries was crispy. And the toppings   OMG.
Daygos San Diego Taco Shop,14,I ordered the California burrito  amp  my friend ordered the street tacos.. Mind you  we re both from Cali so we re picky about our Mexican food  The food tastes just like back home  It was sooo yummy. Definitely worth what I paid for. I d totally eat here again whenever I m in Austin.
Daygos San Diego Taco Shop,15,California burritos were massive and so good with the carne asada. Never had French fries inside my burrito but it was amazing.
Daygos San Diego Taco Shop,16,How did I not know about this place sooner  My fiance and I ordered the Daygo Fries  The Rolled Tacos and the Chips  amp  Salsa.  This is every bit as good  and I d say better  than the rolled tacos and carne asada fries you ll get in San Diego. The portions were very big for the cost  the flavor was incredibly delicious and the chips were fresh and well salted. Somehow the fries managed to stay crispy even after my drive home to eat.  And beside the food  the gentlemen manning the window when I showed up was extremely polite and courteous. It s the little things that really put this place over. My fiance described it as a 10 10 and I agree 
Daygos San Diego Taco Shop,17,This place is a hidden gem  The tacos were amazing and it s outside a brewery so there is some seating. Can t wait to go again 
Daygos San Diego Taco Shop,18,The weather was perfect today  so it was a perfect day to see what all of the hype was about at Daygos.. the San Diego style food truck. The guy at the window was friendly and helpful. I ordered the carne asada fries and also got the Cali burrito  which was for my kids so I didn t try that. These fries are seriously life changing. This is one item that I will add to my rotation of my weekly cheat meal. I highly recommend  
Daygos San Diego Taco Shop,19,Ok  I m from San Diego and I ve had about a million California burritos. This is the best I ve ever had. Yes  it s a little more expensive than what you re used to paying  but this is a gourmet California burrito. Next level. Go and treat yourself
Daygos San Diego Taco Shop,20,I d like to post a picture  but I ate my burrito too damn fast. Having grown accustomed to the carn  asada burritos in San Diego  and very much missing them in TX  I had been wanting to try this place. Sadly  they did not receive their beef delivery  so I tried the 619 burrito with pollo asada instead. You know what  It was delicious  I will 100  be a repeat customer. Great food  great customer service 
Daygos San Diego Taco Shop,21,We re trying to eat a bit less these days  thanks to those extra Covid 19 pounds  and started with the California burrito to share. I was a bit skeptical of fries in my burrito  but it was delicious.   I d probably try the other burrito without fries next time just to cut out some calories  but if that doesn t matter to you then go for it.  We hung out at Oskar Blues a bit longer which meant more beer and another order via the Daygos app from inside the brewery. This time we got Mucho Nachos with chicken. Ingredients were evenly distributed and again everything was so tasty that I found myself not wanting to share.   Sorry  I can t post photos because we gobbled it up too fast  but I promise everything we had was IG worthy.   I d easily order out from Daygos if we lived closer  but I ll just have to settle for Tuesday night open mics.   PRO TIP  Daygos ONLY accepts orders online so make sure you get a confirmation text if your order.  Don t opt out of texts upon checkout otherwise you won t get the notification 
Daygos San Diego Taco Shop,22,Some of the best tacos and burritos I ve had in Austin. Trust me when I say the carne asada fries don t miss  Right next to a brewery so perfect location. There is a reason this man has a two hour wait for his food well worth it.
Daygos San Diego Taco Shop,23,Daygo s is legit   Hands down the best in town for authentic Mexican food coming straight up from my hometown of San Diego  CA. Dre is the best and he brings back the hometown feeling when you have conversation with him. The food is   California burrito  carneasada chips  amp  fries  quesadilla -   Everything is made to order and fresh. Dre will not let you down when it comes to Mexican food.
Daygos San Diego Taco Shop,24,Passionate food truck owner  kind and generous  and of course  delicious food. Daygos was a perfect pairing with the beer at Oskar Blues Brewery. I will definitely be back.
Daygos San Diego Taco Shop,25,Might cry about the existence of this food truck  Ever since we moved away from California I ve been looking  in vain  for a good burrito in Austin. This is it     We got the chicken to be healthy  ha  and I couldn t believe how good it was. Definitely getting the carne asada next time. Owner was super nice and it s in a parking lot with some other good looking options  soul food  vegan nigerian . Happy to have this place so close by on MLK.
Daygos San Diego Taco Shop,26,Tried this after a friend who has lived in San Diego recommended it. Got the carne asada California burrito which was delicious. I immediately destroyed it  and lamented that I did not order a second one. I will be going back here soon to try the nachos and California fries 
Daygos San Diego Taco Shop,27,Best burrito I ve found in Austin for sure. Very friendly service too. We ll be back soon 
Daygos San Diego Taco Shop,28,I lived in San Diego for 27 years and grew up on  authentic San Diego Mexican food  as this place claims to have.  This place has a lot of nerve taking frozen taquitos  throwing guacamole and cheese on them and claiming they are real rolled tacos. Take from someone who grew up eating California burritos  this place is doesn t taste like home. Just another Texas Mexican food truck.
Daygos San Diego Taco Shop,29,This place is impossible to find and once I did I was told I had to order on their website. There was no one else there so it should have been easy to take my order especially when it s so hot outside. I went and looked at the menu and everything is  20 and  7 for chips and salsa  Insane prices for any burrito. Real tacos in California are dirt cheap.
Daygos San Diego Taco Shop,30,Y all I found a small piece of home right in the heart of Austin   This place is phenomenal      I ordered the Daygo fries  carne asada fries . I encourage all my cali friends that moved to Texas and have been missing our southern cali Mexican food And my Texas local friends that have been wondering what we are talking about to go check out  daygossandiegotacoshop    You won t be disappointed I promise you  I live so far away but it s worth the trip  Even with the gas prices lol  supportsmallbusiness  blackownedbusiness  southerncalimexicanfood  daygosandiegotacoshop
Daygos San Diego Taco Shop,31,Delicious. Carne Asada fries and California burrito are both amazing. Will be going again.
Daygos San Diego Taco Shop,32,Delicious and great service. Light and crispy chips seemed homemade. Awesome nachos. Very fresh  authentic California Mexican food.
Daygos San Diego Taco Shop,33,Such a rip off.  20 for a burrito less the length of a subways foot long and half the girth of a chipotle burrito. It tasted like a generic burrito. I usually don t leave reviews if the food is bad  I just don t go back but this is a flat out scam. Our fries were also soggy and the size of a shriveled shoestring fry.
Daygos San Diego Taco Shop,34,Best CA style burrito in Austin. Got the California burrito with carne asada. Great value and service.
Daygos San Diego Taco Shop,35,As close to an authentic San Diego burrito as you re going to get in Austin. The carne asada was well-seasoned and delicious. Definitely will be returning here to try out the other dishes
Daygos San Diego Taco Shop,36,Being from San Diego and moving to Austin was hard in the first place. One of many reasons why it s hard leaving San Diego is taco shop food. So glad we found this place today 4 23 22. It s like we never left San Diego. Food is bomb  Check them out 
Daygos San Diego Taco Shop,37,This place us great. Really. You re missing out if you don t eat here. The portions are big. The food isn t just some other taco truck. It s really great.
Daygos San Diego Taco Shop,38,First time coming here and honestly I got lost trying to find it but the food was AMAZING    Loved the service as well  had a great conversation and time there  I tried the California burrito  best one I have tried so far  I will be coming again and will recommend it to friends as well 
Daygos San Diego Taco Shop,39,No Lie..... Best  quesadilla and Burrito  in ATX hands down  We went to Oskar Blues  and saw the truck and was glad to give it a shot. Portion wise  was on point  Food was amazing.... I normally don t do reviews  but I had to with them.... Service was top notch too. I didn t get his name  but he even brought my food inside to me. Thank you again  I will come and grub some more in the near future.
Daygos San Diego Taco Shop,40,I will make sure to stop by each time I m in Austin for the Daygo fries and rolled tacos. They are just that good.
Daygos San Diego Taco Shop,41,Finally got to come here with my friends after weeks of trying to find the time. I got the California burrito and we shared a order of daygo fries  and let me tell you  they were both by far two of the best pieces of food I ve ever eaten  and easily the loaded fries and burrito s in the city aswell. The fries were full of such rich flavor topped of with perfectly cooked carne asada that left all three of us completely full  but the burrito was something else. The burrito was beautiful  it wasn t just big but it also tasted amazing. The carne asada was cooked beautifully and the flavors of the burrito were rich and full and will have you feeling stuffed. Lastly  I wanna give a massive shoutout to Dre  your hospitality made eating here a great experience I won t forget. Definitely looking forward to coming and back and telling everyone about y all. Y all are up next   
Daygos San Diego Taco Shop,42,Born and raised in SD and this was easily the best Cali b I ve had in Austin and it s not even close. Honestly better than some of the local places in SD  very authentic. The owner is extremely friendly  a must try if you re looking for Mexican food that tastes like San Diego.
Daygos San Diego Taco Shop,43,The best tacos u Habs had since moving to Texas. I have been searching for someone to make rolled tacos just like San Diego. Can t wait to go back 
Daygos San Diego Taco Shop,44,Tiny  amp  perfect little food truck in East Austin. California burrito was incredible and you could tell how much love and passion went into it. Making Daygos our new spot 
Daygos San Diego Taco Shop,45,Amazing carne asada  We had the California burrito and carne asada tacos and both were so good. The meat was tender and full of flavor  super high quality  definitely worth the slightly higher prices . Chips and salsa were great as well. I cannot wait to try the carne asada fries. Totally recommend if you are missing southern California style Mexican food.
Taqueria Arandas,1,So yummy and great price   Their pozole hits amazing after a long night of drinks  Tacos are 3 for like  4 great price  amp  servers are the sweetest
Taqueria Arandas,2,Old school spot. Really good food  good customer service as well. I ve been coming here well over 20 years.
Taqueria Arandas,3,Friendly and helpful staff  they always go out of their way to greet the customers and have a small but pretty great menu.  Highly recommend the Chiliquilas with eggs and the tacos.
Taqueria Arandas,4,Me dieron un pinche pescado crudo  yo creo hasta vivo lo tenia  nomas le echaron la salsa a la diabla y me lo dieron  que horrible que tengo que hacer extra y venir hacer un review porque siempre me gustaba venir aqu . Me quede sin palabras porque la prob   Espero ver el cocinero en el infierno conmigo  pinche culero.   I just took a bite of a completely raw fuxking fish. I m speechless for the shiiii they just pulled on me  it just makes me mad because I actually loved this place and location  but that cook must be on crack for bathing a raw fish with salsa and having the audacity to serve it to me. I ll be seeing his a   in hell with me.
Taqueria Arandas,5,I love this restaurant so much  The ladies always have such a positive attitude and coming here always helps me feel like home. Their restaurant is so cozy and the food is such a great price point  A party of 2 can eat for around  25 and I ve taken a party of 6 here for about  80 which isn t bad at all - especially considering the food portions  If you want authentic Mexican food this is the place to go 
Taqueria Arandas,6,This is probably the worst place I have eaten in Austin. My boyfriend and I went around 2pm and were starving so this place really disappointed us.    Service was okay and prices are cheap.
Taqueria Arandas,7,Basic no-frills San Antonio-style Tex-Mex  and their best location. Big portions  low prices  simple tomato-y salsa  I love it. Everything is tasty and well-made and they have great service. When my uncle came to visit and asked for Tex-Mex I gave him a few options and he chose this one and just couldn t get over how good and simple everything was. Ignore the bougie low reviews here and go try out some awesome plain Tex-Mex.
Taqueria Arandas,8,Worst food ever ...Small hair in my plate undercooked shrimps i can say they must have microwave and served and most importantly michelada was the worst.lots of chili I cannot even taste my beer ...avoid going to arandas server did not even serve us water she forgot .poor quality and service.
Taqueria Arandas,9,I had to go all the way to Austin to get the perfect birthday burrito. The horchata was so refreshing in the heat. Our waitress was super nice. Also a good location next to congress st
Taqueria Arandas,10,Feels like a neighborhood place to me and it always seems like there are families or small groups of friends here to share a meal. This place isn t huge and has colorfully decorated high back benches and tables along the ways and larger tables in the middle. The food here has been consistently tasty.   If you re getting fajitas - don t expect big thick strips of beef or chicken. It s more like marinated chips of meat that are tender with food flavor. I also like the pastor and the guisada. The retried beans are a unusually lighter color but have a sweet savoriness that I really like. Add that with fresh clean crisp lettuce  tomato and avocado slices and it s a good meal. I also like the salsa because it unapologetically has a kick.   Service was friendly and courteous.
Taqueria Arandas,11,The service was great and the food across the board was flavorful and very authentic. Large portions make this easy to split. And  I loved the salsa   
Taqueria Arandas,12,Local spots live on  I grew up in here on sunday mornings. Great food and people.
Taqueria Arandas,13,Didn t leave Austin before stopping by for another local fix.  Arandas was pretty good.  The prices are reasonable.  The salsa is delicious  but the tostada chips were not fresh.  I had the torta de pastor and my husband had the gordita.  The torta was ok.  I ve had better in El Paso.  Too much bread.  The pastor meat was delicious though. I tried the horchata because of a previous review  but I was disappointed.  It is made from a powered mix and not authentic.  We ll probably come back next time we re in Austin  but to try some other menu items.
Taqueria Arandas,14,Great price  food is really good. Can t beat 4.99 for a chorizo and egg plate that comes with potatoes and beans AND tortillas. Service was fast and friendly
Taqueria Arandas,15,The staff doesn t speak any English whatsoever. Nice staff  but it does concern me a little bit when the staff doesn t speak English in an English speaking environment. The food was good. I have no complaints on the food itself  however  the tortillas are NOT homemade. I can tell they are store bought. I find that interesting since this is a Mexican restaurant. I know this place comes up as Tex-Mex. Its not  it s an actual Mexican restaurant. The food doesn t resemble any Tex-Mex at all. Again  the food is good and I think it s just the right amount for a person. But Tex-Mex restaurants have taco salads  this place doesn t. I m really on the fence between rating this place a 4 or 3 star. But  because I m in a good mood  I ll give it a 4.
Taqueria Arandas,16,Food was good. Very authentic so authentic they didn t even know what mild salsa was. The salsa was very spicy but delicious  my poor little taste buds couldn t take the heat. Would definitely return
Taqueria Arandas,17,my bf and my favorite place to get authentic food and yummy drinks  definitely a hidden gem
Taqueria Arandas,18,So sorry but this place really has the worst tacos I have ever eaten  I order 3 crunchy tacos and they brought them with a crunchy HEB tortilla cold and disgusting nothing to do with a Mexican taco. At then end a fly got into my horchata and when I told the waiter she said they can t prevent this to happen and I think that is not the appropriate answer with the right actitud for a customer.  Definitely I will not recommend or come back.
Taqueria Arandas,19,It s friendly-it s the best homemade red salsa I ve ever had. The staff is friendly and the prices are good. Definitely worth a stop.
Taqueria Arandas,20,Wasn t really as impressed as our friends and other reviews made this place out to be. Maybe it s because we didn t come for breakfast  but either way this visit will be our only one. We had a quesadilla  pork burrito  chicken enchiladas. Okay if starving  lacked flavor.
Taqueria Arandas,21,This place is terrible. We went there for breakfast and the potatoes and eggs looked green. The tamales were made with cornbread. Very wrong for Mexican food. Never going back.
Taqueria Arandas,22,My husband and I went here today because Torchy s Taco parking situation wasn t great and we didn t feel like walking from multiple blocks to eat so we went down the road and saw this place and I must say  for the price  it was great  I got the pork burrito with double rice  the pork was flavorful but the tortilla was kind of hard to cut through. I ended up having to dump all of the meat out of the tortilla because my knife wouldn t cut it properly. The rice was bland but the flavor of the meat made it good  Our waitress was super quick and helpful during our meal 
Taqueria Arandas,23,I liked the Gordita.  It was big  tasty  fresh and reasonably priced.  It s not your traditional Gordita but never the less  good.  The staff is wonderful and speak English.  They are attentive and friendly.  I recommend all around.
Taqueria Arandas,24,Came here on a night when I desperately wanted a cheap plate of food and a margarita  The dream  right   This place did not disappoint. Margaritas were delicious and our server was very kind. I got the enchiladas and they could have used some more seasoning but they weren t bad in general. I ll definitely be back.
Taqueria Arandas,25,If you need a quick fix of good and cheap Tex-Mex food this is the spot. They have really good breakfast tacos which wont burn a hole in your wallet. Never had bad customer service here they re all great from the servers to the owner. They have some of the best chips and salsa in Austin. I highly recommend the al pastor  beans  rice  burritos  horchata  and flan. That being said don t come in expecting authentic Mexican food because it s not this is a good and cheap Tex-Mex restaurant.
Taqueria Arandas,26,I have somehow managed to go here twice and hated it both times. The food is bland and the waiters hate their job. The first time there I tried the quesadillas which were not good and overall lacked flavor. The second time I got the flautas which were cold on the middle. The rice was gross and you could tell that it came from a can. The aguas frescas are made from powder and are not actual agua frescas. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for an authentic Mexican restaurant.
Taqueria Arandas,27,Damn good Tex-Mex - dirt cheap prices  Awesome salsas  Can t go wrong here. Good food  great service  awesome prices  The trifecta 
Taqueria Arandas,28,How is this place listed at 4 stars   Food was bland. I m pretty sure the chili con queso was actually velveeta cheese.  Ordered a margarita  but were out.  This place is a dump and the bathrooms are disgusting.  Not sure how this place is in business.  But please beware-this place is nowhere close to a 4 star rating.
Taqueria Arandas,29,I had a four-dollar chicken gordita  little fattie   that tasted like heaven and completely filled me up. It was hot and fresh...made with high quality ingredients and perfectly seasoned. The chips and salsa are fabulous as well. The iced tea was fresh like it was made from mountain spring water. It was 11 30 on Saturday morning and we were seated immediately...our food was out within 5 minutes. We were one of only 2 or 3 non-Spanish speaking tables...our waitress seemed perfectly happy to lead us through some stilted Spanglish attempts at ordering. She was very friendly...and you pay at the counter  Please do NOT tell anyone about this awesome place.
Taqueria Arandas,30,Nice place  larger restaurant style setup with a full menu.  I had 2 tacos steak fajita  amp  2 tacos pastor. Pretty much the standard yum level of Mexican food  not mind blowing but satisfying and very good tasting. Didn t give 5 stars because the tacos aren t  taco trailer  level.  The place was clean and super friendly and attentive staff  even at 1130pm   By the way  the chips and salsa are very good. Will def be going back for more.
Taqueria Arandas,31,Just moved to Austin the staff was so sweet and amazing  Food was perfection  Enchiladas Verde s and horchata   I would totally come here again. And the price was great  And the food was fast  didn t wait long at all.
Taqueria Arandas,32,I can safely say I have eaten here more than most other restaurants in Austin. The food is super reasonably priced and regardless of how busy it is  the food is QUICK to your table. Not the strongest English speaking staff  but everyone there is super friendly. Make sure to get an horchata to go before you leave.
Taqueria Arandas,33,3 stars if you come here for dinner.  4 stars if you come here for breakfast.   The breakfast plates and tacos are definitely a bang for your buck  I mean 3 tacos for  3.75  yes please    The tortillas don t seem particularly homemade and the machacado was a little too beef-jerky in texture  but for the price point  I really can t complain.  The enchiladas were a little bit of a miss. For  7.50  that is only marginally cheaper than any other Tex-Mex place on S.1st that does it better. Enchilada sauce tasted straight out of a can  tortillas were chewy and rice was not flavorful. I think you would have a much better bet ordering something more authentic  like the carne guisada or caldo de res.   I like this little spot but will only be here for breakfast from now on. Note  Margarita machine was switched off Sunday around 6pm
Taqueria Arandas,34,Simple and bright  the food is great. Low prices. Second time here  and tried Migas and Huevos Rancheros. Family had chorizo. All delicious. Fresh salsa was great.
Taqueria Arandas,35,Part of the reason I like this place so much is the power of suggestion - the taqueria is Jalisco style  which is the neighboring state to Aguascalientes where some of my roots are buried.  Aside from that  I ve never been disappointed by the food.  I used to prefer Tapatia on Ben White  amp  Banister  but they are cash only.  Arandas  however  takes credit card  even though I often feel foolish putting  2.17 on my credit card for breakfast tacos.  Bring change for the jukebox  though   TIP  you don t have to order the breakfast tacos exactly as they list them  e.g. bean and cheese  potato and egg  etc.   I always order a bacon potato cheese and a nopalitos eggs  and they re more than happy to customize my tacos.
Taqueria Arandas,36,This place is just a few blocks from my house  and I m determined to find the best Mexican food I can in the area  so me and the girly decided to give them a go.  The place is nice  bright and clean. The wait staff  while short on English are all very friendly  The menu  both in English and Spanish  is uncomplicated and easy to make your mind up with.  The food... well  they have outstanding salsa  though the chips were on the stale side. I got the barbacoa and lengua plate  and both were bland. The beans and rice were tasty  so wrapping the meat in a tortilla with the veggies made it much more palatable... but really  unless you are just really not in the mood to look further - try some place else.
Taqueria Arandas,37,Best damn crispy chicken tacos in Austin. I like it simple sometimes and this place does it perfectly. The chicken has a great roasted flavor and is juicy.  The ladies are always really nice even when I try to order in Spanish for practice  hope I m not too terrible .   Huge bonus  Price tag  Lunch for 2 people with a drink around  14 with chips and salsa 
Taqueria Arandas,38,Absolutely love this place  Have been coming here for years with my family they know us very well. As soon as they see us they put our appetizer in and the service is so fast  The girls there are amazing  And the price is right 
Taqueria Arandas,39,Pretty darn awesome. Al Pastor seems like the perfect meat  BBQ spicy pork.   Had the combo plate with fajita meat and Al Pastor. the fajita beef was a bit chewy and the flour tortillas a bit stale. The Al Pastor made up for all that  The soda fountain is deceptive since when I ordered a coke  I ended up with a can.  Fast service. WiFi didn t work when I visited yesterday  locked on but no Internet .  Like I said Al Pastor made up for all the rough edges...
Taqueria Arandas,40,Really good food.  Original and different from the other Mexican restaurants on the street   which is a good thing. I had the cheese enchiladas with salsa verde   he had migas and tacos al pastor. The chicharons were tender.
Taqueria Arandas,41,This is my favorite Tex-Mex joint in Austin.  It is also the best of the 5 Arandas locations.  My favorites are the fajita beef tacos and their cheese  or chicken  enchiladas with verde sauce.  These are some of the best tacos and enchiladas I ve had.  The price is obviously great and this location is the nicest with big wooden tables.  I ve been to the original location on E 7th many times and the other 3 locations as well but the food for some reason is much better at this location on S. 1st.  They stay open pretty late but we always call to make sure they are still open because sometimes they seem to close early.
Taqueria Arandas,42,When I came here for breakfast I asked for a second serving of the refried beans  they were SOO good  I m used to leaving the typical breakfast place feeling uncomfortably full so the reasonable portions were bittersweet.
Taqueria Arandas,43,Came in here this morning for some breakfast tacos... Meh...  The good  We were able to sit down right away They brought our first chips and salsa quickly The owner   manager was friendly The final price  The Meh...  The service was slow - took quite a while to get a refill on chips and salsa The breakfast tacos.  We had a bacon  egg  and cheese  and it was basically slightly over cooked eggs  a little brown   with a strip of bacon on top  and shredded cheese on top of that  not cold  but still clearly in shredded form .  It s obvious that breakfast tacos are NOT their specialty.  I also had an egg and beans taco  which was OK. The service was slow - took almost 10 minutes to get our check after asking for it.  With SO many mexican options in Austin  I probably won t be back.
Taqueria Arandas,44,You goddamn bastards.  I have eaten your Tortas 4 times in the last week.  Can t you take pity on a simple white boy who doesn t know how to control himself   Delicious  dirt-cheap food and...  UNLIMITED HORCHATA REFILLS  Argh  It s so delicious  and so many calories   They also speak spanish to me when I come in... I dig that.
Taqueria Arandas,45,I m going to agree with Niki A on this one  whoa  I was a little surprised by the table of vaqueros drinking Especials  Especiales   at ten o  clock in the morning.  After that little awakening  it shouldn t have come as a shocking surprise that my waitress wasn t super comfortable with her command of English  and I basically ordered by pointing at things on the menu here.  This place is flat authentic  no way around it  and as haphazard as the dining experience is  breakfast did hit the spot and was out in a jiffy.  To their credit  Taqueria Arandas recognizes that they get a healthy dose of the local Hispanic population as well as a regular audience of gueros  and the menu is broken down into English and Spanish pronunciations under tiny flags of each country.  There were loads of things that I wanted to try  but this go round I settled for three breakfast tacos  they re 90 cents each...I haven t seen a cent symbol on a menu in I don t know when  and a soda.  Ultimately the three stars is more for the fact that the place is sort of randomly laid out and paying out was a pain. About a half dozen of us sort of stood around and waited while the gal at the check out counter slowly made progress. But everyone was super sweet here  and the people watching was solid enough that I d go back just to experience the authenticity of a world which I m allowed to periodically visit.  And it reminded me why I m amped that I live here.  Because lurking behind some doors is an adventure  culinary or otherwise  always waiting and ready.
Taqueria Arandas,46,After a night doing semi bad things in very strange places  I ended up on the southside  with a few friends  after no sleep  too much beer and a hangover.    Suddenly I had a brilliant cure for said hangover- Breakfast Tacos   Luckily for us  we were able to stumble across the street in our pajamas   well some of us  and sit at a really authentic  delicious  inexpensive joint. I had two tacos and hash browns ...but they were so filling I could only eat one. The hash browns were amazing too. They kind of confused our order a whole lot  but fixed it very quickly.   Now I wont lie and say that Taqueria Arandas was the complete and total hangover cure  but it did make me feel human enough to attempt the drive back to north Austin.  Great night. Great Tacos.
Taqueria Arandas,47,Would you rate authentic American food a 4 or 5 star simply for being authentic if you lived in France  If not  then you should probably think twice about doing the same for a Mexican food restaurant in America. Bad food in Mexico doesn t translate to good food in America. That s exactly what Taqueria Arandas is.   If the above isn t clear enough for you  let me spell it out as frankly as I know how  the food and environment are authentic at Taqueria Arandas  but the food is terrible. There s a reason you pay  2 for a couple of chicken tacos with free  bottomless chips and salsa. Hint  it isn t because the owner is generous  but it might have something to do with cheap products and not having a chef in sight.  I ordered a pretty simple dish - cheese enchiladas with red sauce. What came out of the  kitchen  was a microwaved plate containing three soggy tortillas  rolled around approximately a half-ounce each of nacho cheese sauce  and floating in what science would call a solution of grease and melted nacho cheese sauce. If there was any lycopene present it was in trace amounts and would take a team of CSI folks to detect it. Sadly  I m not exaggerating. Measuring with my fork laid on it s side  the artery-clogging grease-bath was 3-out-of-4 prongs deep - or about a half-inch. The sides of refried beans and rice abandoned their roles as sides and instead took on new lives as beaches to the cheese-lake in my plate.  Because I hate biased reviews that selectively include or omit information for the sake of bettering their argument  I d like to say that their slightly-flaky-in-a-good-way chips are served warm and they aren t stingy with them  and the salsa has some kick to it  unlike the tomato juice you re served at a lot of places. The prices are  as preached about in the other reviews  cheaper than I feel comfortable paying for meat that I plan on eating.   If you re broke or on a tight budget  have an insatiable craving for Mexican food regardless of the quality  and live in the area  give it a shot. Otherwise  I recommend passing this one up. Surely Austin has better Mexican food to offer at a fair price.
Taqueria Arandas,48,I hate to place a crap review on small  family friendly  restaurants that are unbelievably cheap  but frankly  I can t NOT share this information.  I live in Travis Heights and have been going to Arandas for years.  Not every day  but definitely once a month on average.  Cheap food that is good  cheap beer  relatively friendly folks.   It s always been a winner.    That said  the rest of the review will make you a little queezy  so if you re sensitive to disgusting food stories  stop reading NOW.  I ll keep the story short and concise  saving commentary for y all.  The last time I went there  I got halfway through my burrito and found a fingernail floating in my mouth.  I was in disbelief.  Did I somehow chew my OWN fingernail that day without knowing it   So I looked up  and standing just over the food was the expo  or person who carries the food from the kitchen to your table  standing over the kitchen window chewing his nails and spitting them haphazardly out.  I m not accusing him of intentionally spitting his gnawed fingernails into the food of paying customers  but in my case  his fingernail was spit directly into my burrito.  Honestly  I left cash on the table and left without saying a word.  I know I should have complained  but I knew with certainty that I would never be able to visit this place again  and I was so irate that I d have made a scene if I was to start talking about it.  I still get nauseous just driving past it.
Taqueria Arandas,49,For posole  I go to Taqueria Arandas. They have posole on the weekends. It s a spicy broth with chunks of juicy roasted pork and hominy - large  soft corn kernels. It s usually served with a side of tortillas -- corn  flour or crispy tostada  and shredded lettuce  lime wedges and chopped onions.  I love Arandas  Pierna Burrito. No rice  no cheese. Refried beans  juicy pork  lettuce  tomatoes  avocado. The perfect burrito. I also lived on them when I was broke because they can feed you for half a day and cost less than three bucks.
Taqueria Arandas,50,Taqueria Arandas.  Those words are a hangover cure by themselves - repeat them while consuming the only-served-on weekend-mornings menudo  and you ll turn into freaking Super wo man.  Seriously.  Everything I ve ever eaten at this joint is exquisitely good.  Authentic.  No BS  just good TexMex made by real TexMexicans.  And supercheap  too - damn close to everything is under  10  and a lot is under  5   I heart you  Taqueria Arandas.  I know you heart me back.  Let s heart together in my tummy.
Taqueria Arandas,51,So why is it that people assume that they are going to get  authentic  mexican food at a taqueria here in Austin  Even taquerias in Mexico are not that  authentic   but we still go to them. Why  Because we enjoy the culture of eating at a taqueria - sitting at the bar of stand hunched over stuffing our face with tacos as the salsa drips down our hand  the small napkins that can only be used once  wiping our noses because of the hot salsa  drinking manzana  not worrying about what anyone thinks as we eat  and finally the satisfaction of being full and only having to dish out a couple of pesos. DAMN I love it   Try not to overanalyze the taquerias here in Austin  but become a regular at one where you know the servers and cooks. I happen to prefer Taqueria Arandas because I have never been disappointed by their food  both in taste and quantity   and I know I won t have to drop  20 eating there. If you do go  order the Al Pastor and Lengua combination plate. Provecho 
Taqueria Arandas,52,I really don t understand most other Yelpers problems with this place. Yeah  it does resemble the interior of a  high school cafeteria  and most of the waitresses don t have a firm grasp on English but what were you expecting  Just don t come here  go to Manuel s or any of the other numerous yuppie Tex-Mex options in this town. This is a no frills   mostly  authentic taqueria that serves simple Mexican fare at a very low cost. And after living here  how do you not know what a few simple word in Spanish mean  The menu isn t complicated.   I mainly come here for the breakfast tacos and plates. They re not the best I ve ever had and the corn tortillas aren t anything to write home about but they re cheap and satisfying. The service is fairly quick  waitresses are very friendly and attentive  and you move on about your day. It s not a place you come for the atmosphere. It s basically the equivalent of an American diner. I was a bit annoyed that you have to pay 99 cents for chips before 11am but I didn t really want them that early anyways and the breakfast tacos were more than filling enough.   I d recommend this place if you re near it in the morning but I wouldn t go out of my way. There are plenty of other locations around town and we just happened to be by this one.
Taqueria Arandas,53,The chicken taquitos are wonderful  except when you get some kinda nastychikkinsurprise  which is about 17  of the time  which is why i gave them 4 stars instead of 5.   But my fave is to get enchiladas with two cheese and one chikkin  or one cheese and two chikkin  if i m feelin  lucky   with LOTS of salsa verde.  the barbacoa is great too.  the tea is like water.  but this place is consistent  cheap  and great.
Taqueria Arandas,54,Shit  guys. Why have I lived next to here for this long and never been here before  We got SO MUCH FOOD for  14 and I m legit about to have the last of the leftovers tonight for dinner...one full week later. I love the chips  but they re obviously from a bag so I m not sure where they get off on charging extra for more than one small basket  but at least the surcharge keeps me from gorging myself on empty carbs before I get the chance to gorge myself on fatty meat  fatty beans  and fatty cheese. Fatty.  The food was delicious  but proceed with caution if you get chicken because I found a tiny bone in my pile of meat. Just big enough that I probably would ve swallowed it sideways if I hadn t happened to slow down my unbridled gluttony for like half a second.  And because there are no signs inside telling you what to do  pick a seat and someone will bring you menus and chips. If you walk up and grab your own chips because there s not an employee in sight  the guys in the kitchen will stare at you with a strange expression on their faces for most of the time you re there.  Next time I go  I plan on getting down on that al pastor because the pictures on here are making my mouth water.  99c surcharge if your food is ordered to-go.
Taqueria Arandas,55,I go here at the end of the month because it is cheap and the servings are big. I don t know what it is about Mexican restaurants  but the real  authentic ones usually have gigantic servings. Anyway  I get their  3 burrito  a big gut bomb. But  it is good  if you get the steak and not the chicken. It doesn t come with rice and beans  though. Not that I can eat all of it anyway  but I still like them with the meal.  The other things I get here are the breakfast plates or the soups. The caldo de res or pollo are very good when you are sick. And it may sound weird  but if you have a cold  eat these first thing in the morning and it is seriously a medical miracle. It always works for me 
Taqueria Arandas,56,So here s a tip for when you go to Arandas  which you should.  Just because the torta is under  3 does NOT mean it is small.  So don t think you need to order a side of rice and beans and an avocado taco to make a whole meal of it.    There is nothing remotely healthy for you at Arandas  and for this  I love them.  Also  get the horchata.
Taqueria Arandas,57,I see that there are a number of positive reviews for this establishment  so I have to wonder what went wrong for me. My boyfriend  amp  I went for dinner on a Saturday night  and perhaps we should have taken a clue from the plentiful parking that this was not a prime destination. Main observations   1  The chips were incredibly stale. Store-bought chips are bad enough  but we re talking I-opened-those-Santitas-chips-for-Cinco-de-Mayo-and-now-it s-late-September stale.  2  The atmosphere can only be compared to a high school cafeteria.  3  The staff acted overwhelmingly annoyed by our presence from the get-go. I m sorry I took French in high school or else I would certainly try to order in the appropriate language  but please don t glare at me for not understanding you when you continue to speak Spanish to me.  4  Food was mediocre  but definitely not terrible. I had enchiladas and bf had migas  and we both agreed that if not for the atmosphere  the food alone and dirt cheap prices would probably lure us in on occasion.  All in all  if every other Mexican restaurant in South Austin burned down  I suppose I would return to Taqueria Arandas  5. And I d be damn sure to bring some Spanish flashcards with me.
Taqueria Arandas,58,The food is almost EXACTLY like it is at the other location  stassney  that I go to at least once a week.   I thought for sure there would be some differences  but if I had closed my eyes I would have thought I was right back on Stassney.   Good service  great food  and this building is really open and nicely decorated. It was a nice change of pace  but I m glad I didn t have to give up the great taste I love so much    You can t beat this food as far as I m concerned....amazing salsa  homemade chips  and a pork taco that makes me wish I d known about them all my life.
Taqueria Arandas,59,Rock solid inexpensive mexican food.   Waitstaff is very friendly. It helps if you speak a little Spanish. C mon people . . .  David  you live in Texas . . . you should at the very least be able to greet people and order food in Spanish.  My favorite is the chicken burrito. It s cheap  it s the perfect size  it has avocado in it and no rice. Perfection as far as I m concerned.   The fact that you can get a satisfying meal for about  5 including drink is a godsend. Please open one of these in LA. I beg you.
Taqueria Arandas,60,This place is really great for breakfast  and super low prices. The tacos are inexpensive and wonderful  I didn t particularly care for the menudo but tortas gorditas and tacos are definitely good here.
Taqueria Arandas,61,Where else can you go for breakfast and see half the people in the restaurant drinking a beer with their food   I love this place. Sure  the atmosphere is a bit janky and there is a non-existent parking lot  but the food is good and cheap.   I like the beef fajita plate. Order it with some grilled green onions  or  cebollitas.  The salsa is a bit on the thin side  but it gets a little spicy and then you can t stop eating it.   I wouldn t even call this tex-mex  y all. Arandas is the closest thing to the real deal Mexican food you can get in Austin. They get a bonus for their excellent selection of delicious Mexican candy 
Taqueria Arandas,62,I went here for lunch yesterday hoping to find a cheap lunch that was good Mexican food. I picked it because it was close to me and the yelp reviews looked pretty good.   NOT GOOD  and I am pretty sure I was overcharged.   I got a chicken quesadilla. It came with cheese and chicken and it was 1 tortilla folded in half.  3 for really soggy chicken that I am pretty sure was pink. I also got a queso for  2.50. It was pretty good. I was trying to get something that would cover up the taste of the stale chips. I also got a soda from a can and a praline to help get that chicken taste out of my mouth. The praline was stale like they had got it in 2005. Yikes.  I ended up driving home before going back to work to brush and floss my teeth so I could get that gross taste of the chicken out.   8.50 plus  1.50 tip    10. No thanks.
Taqueria Arandas,63,For 6.95 I got 5 filling mini tacos. Fast service  cheap food and totally worth your time as long as you are not expecting something fancy. Looking forward to my next visit and trying out the rest of the menu.
Taqueria Arandas,64,I rate this place high because the food fits the price and the hour.  Don t compare it with Manuel s downtown... both can be 5 star if you respect the differences.  Went Saturday night 10pm for the weekend Pozole.  I know this soup well  had it at over 20 places.  it was excellent.  Big bowl  great flavor  great contents.   My wife was a bit shocked with the lingering cinnamon taste in the Pozole  but I told her that was a lesson in differences of recipes     A web search did indeed reveal that it s known to happen.  Great service on our visit. I ve been to their other locations  you may not like everything on the menu - but it s home made and they have their own style. I ll let other reviews tell you other things.
Taqueria Arandas,65,I LOVE THIS PLACE  Can I say that any louder  I m getting up and standing on my chair to proclaim to the entire world in my biggest voice.... This is my favorite place in the whole wide world.  Everything is good. The coffee. The salsa. The beans. These three things  IMHO  are the foundation of any good Mexican restaurant. Without these  you might as well go home and eat soggy corn flakes.  SIDE BAR  I love tortillas  especially handmade corn tortillas. Aranda s does not make tortilla s. They don t even use yellow corn tortillas. Bad  very bad. For that  I should take away two stars. But I can t. Everything else is so freakin good  I am forced to overlook this tragedy. If they made their own corn tortilla s  I would pitch a tent in their parking lot and beg for a job washing dishes just so I could eat there for B  L and D.  My all-time fave is the huevos rancheros. I know  I know.... all you barbacoa and lengua freaks... what s so special about huevos rancheros  Well  I doctor my HR.   First  as soon as we take our seat  I hear my homies in the kitchen chopping my chilies  getting ready to toss them on the grill for a few minutes while one of the lovely servers brings hot  also a very important factor  cups of coffee to the table with a basket of chips and at least two bowls of salsa.  A coupla times  they didn t even ask what I wanted to eat  but instead brought a plate of HR to the table before we had a chance to polish off the second bowl of salsa. Gracias hermanas   So anyway  as the place is filling up with a cloud of chili fumes  most of the customers near the kitchen are coughing and gagging for air. The girls all laugh and point at the big gringo with the shit-eating grin on his face.  When my HR arrives  along with a plate of finely chopped and grilled jalapeno chilies  I dump all the chilies on top of the HR  and dump a whole bowl of salsa on top  as well. Now it s ready.  SIDE BAR  Chili Heads will understand this  It s very difficult to get HOT  anything  at a public eatery. I always laugh at the places with little red chilies next to the menu items noting it s  HOT  factor. Huh  guess again  One must go to great lengths to achieve the desired amount of heat. I m talking Scoville Units here. The more the better. And the hot coffee on top of it only enhances the burn. Ah  tasty.  Anywho  when the egg yoke mixes with the salsa  ranchero  beans and chilies... hold the phone  Clarence..... I need a minute. Good  God y all  it s heaven on earth.  Regarding other menu items. The al pastor is fantastic. It s good any way you like it. The pozole is top notch.  When you Austinites go to Aranda s  5  please tell Estella and the girls  the Big Gringo says hi 
Taqueria Arandas,66,Chicken Burrito and Ice Tea   around  5  with tip   Solid.  This is perhaps the nicest of the various Arandas locations around town. I find my standard chicken burrito is a little better here than at my old regular location on Burnet.  Stick with the basics here and you should be happy. Tacos  burritos  done.
Taqueria Arandas,67,I m pretty addicted to this place.  Some of the best lengua  beef tongue  I ve ever had  coupled with a unique salsa and fresh corn tortillas  and ooh mamacita that Horchata always hits the spot   QUICK service by extremely nice waitresses  who don t speak a lick of English -- a good thing  makes Arandas a hit.   I really need to branch out and try some of the other menu items  I stick to the Pastor  Lengua and Barbacoa platos   but every one of my many food experiences at Arandas has been outstanding.
Taqueria Arandas,68,I only stop in here for lunch. I think it s a great lunch spot. I always get the Al Pastor Burrito. It is very flavorful. Queso and guac are pretty good.   Price is awesome. One of the best values in the city.
Taqueria Arandas,69,We go here all the time. Cheapest breakfast in austin.  3 or less if you get there before 10am. And its pretty damn good  and a nice portion of food. My favorite is the chorizo and eggs. All breakfast plates come with potatoes  beans  and tortillas. For lunch I really like the chicken burrito with added avocado. Again  3.   The chips are always stale  but we ignore that because we always love the food.    The price is just unbeatable. Best place for  morning afters   hangovers  and when you don t want to cook but can t break the bank.   I really hate that I read that fingernail review.... I will just have to chew carefully because I will not be giving up my  randas any time soon.
Taqueria Arandas,70,I used to love this place. Loved the ambiance  the people  the kind of food  the prices.  Last time I ate there I got THE worst case of food poisoning I have ever had in my life. After hours of rather intense suffering finally went to the emergency room and had to pay over  200 for a GI cocktail which finally made me feel better. There was no question this is where I got the food poisoning. It was the only possibility that day. I won t eat there again.
Taqueria Arandas,71,Chips and salsa as soon as you enter.      The food is fresh and they give you plenty of tortillas.  I had a rough one last night and for 3.25.....I got a fat ass plate of migas that knocked the poisons right out of me.  Any of the meats are good.....but i like the al pastor and the beef fajita.....    Good value  quick  affordable.....and I love watching dudes drink Negro Modelo at breakfast.     The horchata is what dreams are made of.     Pwn on intertronz phans.
Taqueria Arandas,72,The price and quickness give it 3 stars.  I went for breakfast tacos during one of those - still half drunk  halfway hungover mornings.  I needed grease and eggs STAT  and out they came.  Then  we got ignored.  I took the boy s car keys and sat in the car with the air conditioning blasting while he paid up the bill.  I wouldn t go if I was craving something deliciously tasty  but I would if I was in the need for quick breakfast tacos in the area.
Taqueria Arandas,73, 3.25 got me three fluffy savory scrambled eggs with bell pepper and chilli  delicious refried beans  home fries and 3 tortillas. Menudo needs way MORE chili  menudo should not be pink  having said that it was still good and I finished the bowl THE VIBE - Lots of OAs  original Austinites  from the neighborhood here....old Mexican American families that despite the rising taxes and influx of new people seem to be staying put and keeping 78704 old school. It was kind of cool and comforting to be amongst them listening to them greet each other in Spanish and English....old and young. I have to say that this is what makes South Austin so awesome the merge of the different food and cultures...... THE FINAL SAY - Good standard Mexican American food with lots of personal service
Taqueria Arandas,74,What can I say...   I love this place   Opens early and closes late.  I ve only tried their tacos so far  as I tend to go there when I want to eat something cheap and tasty after a long night of debaucherous activities.  I ll get around to trying out some of their other offerings and updating this review someday.  I ve tried every all the various tacos they have and my favorite so far has been the taco al pastor.  The pork is juicy and perfectly seasoned with no chewy  rubbery bits like you tend to get at other restaurants.  I have yet to try their flour tortillas  but the corn tortillas are outstanding.  Served fresh  warm  fluffy  and flavorful  they re some of the best I ve encountered in Austin.    The service is pretty decent too.  It s self-seating  so grab a table and within moments a waiter waitress will be there with a basket of deliciously fresh chips and salsa  ready to take your order.  Once you ve made your order the food generally takes no longer than 10 minutes or so to come out.  Drinks  chips  and salsa are refilled frequently without being obtrusive.  Payment is simple as with most taquerias  just go to the counter  tell them what you ordered  and they ll ring you up.  Their tacos are very inexpensive at  1.60 a pop so it s cheap and easy to have a tasty and filling lunch for under  5  especially considering the unlimited free chips and salsa  something I feel should be mandatory in every Tex-Mex restaurant in Austin.  Overall a great place.  How can you go wrong with two tasty tacos  chips and salsa  and a bigass glass of water for  3.20   tax and tip   It beats the hell out of Taco Cabana for a Sunday morning post-party taco fix.  It s just a shame there aren t any locations within walking distance of campus otherwise I d be eating there a lot more often.
Taqueria Arandas,75,Arandas... my late night taco dinner.   If I cannot come up with dinner options because I get off work late this is where I go. They have delicious cheap tacos. The beans are good  with dash of salsa  and while I am not a rice fan the Spanish rice here is quite good.   I generally order the pastor tacos  they are generally spot on  sometimes it doesn t have enough pineapple flavor. I can also get them on flour or corn tortillas. I have found the pastor to be good on flour while I prefer the barbacoa  or guisada on corn.   I don t really care for the chips they use  but the salsa is thick and flavorful. Also  I think they should switch from can soda to fountain drinks but that is just a reflection on their business model.   I think the most underrated item on their menu are the burritos. They are massive and super cheap. I was really surprised at the amount of meat which was inside  when I saw the size I assumed I was going to be overwhelmed by filler. Definitely something to consider if you are starving or considering getting something you can get 2 meals out of. And they conveniently cut it in half for easy rationing.   I have also had the torta and while it was quite good it was pretty much a standard issue torta  but then again that s why it is essentially a Mexican hamburger.
Taqueria Arandas,76,Great authentic breakfast tacos  Excellent price  good service and no wait. Would definitely return 
Taqueria Arandas,77,This place is pretty good...it s a little more authentic than I m used to but I was very happy with the food and decently happy with the service. We came in on a Wednesday night around 7pm and they were dead so we got in  sat down  and were greeted quickly  in Spanish originally but we had to tell her we didn t speak it well enough . I got the steak fajitas and my friend got the enchiladas and we were happy with them. They brought the food out at different times  which was odd but that was okay. They kept our drinks refilled while we were eating  but after we were done it got busy out of no where. When we got there  there were two tables  including us  and as we were eating  three-quarters of the tables filled up and with just two servers  they got overwhelmed. We waited and waited and waited for our check so we just walked to the register to pay. That was disappointing but I understood since they were buy. All in all  I liked the food and the server was friendly so I d be back if I wanted something a little more authentic  but I m still looking for good gringo-Mexican food.
Taqueria Arandas,78,I love this place   I usually get the combo plate with chicken and beef. It s one of the more expensive items on the menu  but after drink and tip  it s still only like 8 or 9 bucks.    Most of the employees will talk to you in Spanish  but most  if not all  know English too. And if you have a problem with someone speaking to you in Spanish  maybe you should open your mind a little before you go to a Mexican restaurant   Cause this ain t no Taco Bell.   As a lot of other people have said  the service here is really great. And I don t know how late this place is open  but it s open pretty darn late.   Next time you re looking for a good  cheap Mexican place  go here. I ve also eaten at the location off Manchaca and Stassney  and I like that one too. But this location definitely has a nicer building.   Seriously  try this place out.
Taqueria Arandas,79,We don t know wtf-Mexican food you Austin-hippies have been eating  but Taqueria Arandas had the  blandest tasting Mexican food we ve ever had. Taco Bell had more flavor than this place.  Following Yelper advice and after reading the great reviews  we were really psyched about going here. Especially to fulfill our Mexican food craving    I ordered the lengua and Curry Lover 1 ordered two tortas. We had to ask for more salsa to douse our food with  since they were flavorless. I do admit I liked the tortillas  but I like HEB tortillas  so that doesn t say much... I don t know if it was an off night for them  or what -- but I was sorry we came.   I thought I was eating healthy food  since it tasted like nothing  but we all know that Mexican food at places that don t speak English definitely are not on the healthy food spectrum.  The waitresses were great though    Anyways  this is the first time the Yelp community has let me down. I hope this never happens again.  P.S. While sitting here typing this up  I can hear both our stomach s making odd gurgling sounds.
Taqueria Arandas,80,The food is a basic regional Mexican food. At one point this was a very economical place to eat at  it isn t that way anymore. If I am going to spend around  8 I will go to Polvos and for a couple dollars more get much more food and better too. There is also a little problem with the wait staff  they usually can t speak English which isn t a problem in itself but they tend to give the most basic service to Caucasians. And before you call me a racist  understand I have been eating there for 12 years and once had a brutal food poisoning...but I kept going back. So  overall..its an ok place..but there are better. I would suggest a Tostado burrito or Torta. One should do ya. The breakfast specials are cheap modest but reasonable.
Taqueria Arandas,81,Bought 24 tacos this morning for  21  without tip .  Everyone loved them.  You will too.  Potato and chorizo taco had egg in it too  and was awesome.
Taqueria Arandas,82,Food was great. Not from this location but I have had it at different locations. I never go on yelp but Jesus. This was the worst service of my life. I waited on my order for 20 minutes and left. Never got the food. They kept serving everyone around me and when I asked them if I was in the wrong section or needed to do something different they kept talking about the news. Seriously this is the worst location in all of Texas. The franchise as a whole is great. This location in beyond awful. Went to Chapala off oltorf.  Had my food ready in 1 2 the time I waited. They were packed. This taqueria arandas is really awfully ran. Management is 99  of the issue.
Taqueria Arandas,83,I recently stopped in the Taqueria Arandas  5 for my first time. Even though I ve lived just up the street from this place I had never been but there always seemed to be a steady flow of customers so I assumed it was a solid choice.     Having now been there and tried it I would rate them as  fair  but not much more. The food is decently priced and is the typical cuisine you would expect from your average Mexican food joint. The service was good  and the food that we had was alright  just nothing to write home about.       If you re in the neighborhood and are looking for great Mexican food  you might look elsewhere  but for the price  I suppose this would be an option if you re on a budget.
Taqueria Arandas,84,Ordered to go  tortillas both flour and corn are straight from the package. We ordered huevos Ranchero and asked for our eggs over medium and they came out over hard  no run to the yolk at all which was very disappointing. Ordered a side of rice and it had absolutely no flavor.  The best thing out of the entr e was the actual Ranchero sauce.  Will not be going back.
Taqueria Arandas,85,Love love love  Best coffee  juevos rancheros  and tortas  Service with a smile   The price is RIGHT 
Taqueria Arandas,86,I stopped in for lunch one day and had a great lunch    They have a nice  bright dining area and I was able to get a table right away. I ordered two tacos the carnitas  pork  and barbacoa. They come with onions and cilantro. I had them on corn tortillas. They were both delicious although the pork one was my favorite.   The salsa was actually very good here too. Normally I don t like the salsa but this stuff was good.   When I was ready to go they hadn t brought me my check but as I ve been going to more of these small taco places that seems to be the norm. You just go to the register and they cash you out.   My lunch was under  5 with a can of Diet Coke. You can t get much better than that  I enjoyed it and will go again.
Taqueria Arandas,87,Simple.  Try the aguacate  avacado  tostado and the taco and have a meal for less than 5 bucks. The salsas are killer.  I love it  but I don t go as often as I want. The portions are huge and the food is decadent.
Taqueria Arandas,88,This is my first Yelp review  so please ...be gentle.  This has been one of my favorite go-to places in the city for almost five years now. When my boyfriend and I can t really decide on what we re in the mood for  we usually end up going here. The food is consistently delicious  the service lands in that perfect area between obtrusive and lackadaisical  and a party of four can eat very comfortably for under  20.  I tend to rate a Tex-Mex place by how good the rice is and their s is no-frills and flavorful  a lot like the establishment. Try the torta cubana with milanesa and a side of guacamole - it hasn t let me down yet.
Taqueria Arandas,89,Cheap Late night eats. We were here on a Wed night at 11 15 the place was empty but the service was friendly and attentive. My fiancee and I both ordered a fajita beef burrito and two chicken tacos. SO much food - Next time we ll probably just split a burrito and have one chicken taco each. The burritos are huge - packed with flavorful meat  beans  avocado  lettuce  and tomatoes. The tacos were literally the most delicious chicken tacos we ve ever had. Shredded chicken with lots of flavor  limes  lettuce   amp  tomato. Homemade tortillas. Great chips. Decent salsa. Great prices - I think the massive burritos were only 3 something a piece. We ll definitely be back next time we re craving late night tacos - or for breakfast  Their breakfast menu looked fantastic - and runs from 7am to 11am.  Cons  No fountain drinks. Soda comes in cans. They do  however  have margaritas  amp  beer - but we didn t try this time.
Taqueria Arandas,90,I love this place ... the people are the friendless. The food is phenomenal. It s very clean and great for a date or a big party. If there was 10 star I woukd give it a 10 
Taqueria Arandas,91,I have been going to this place for over 10 years. I have had a lot of the items they offer here and can t remember anything I ve ordered being  bad . The Torta s are excellent. But I go out of my way to come to this place for one dish that I have eaten here hundreds of times. A dish this place does better than ANY other Mexican food place I have ever been too in the United States. I will eat a raw habanero if anyone can point me to a place that serves a better Chicken Flauta plate.   Most places take a fried corn tortilla  put some chicken in it  and fry it again. I think the secret to these flauta s is starting with a raw corn tortilla  adding the chicken  and then pan frying. You can tell because the center is soft  not like a piece of chicken in a hard chip. When you add the lettuce  tomato  lime  HALF an avocado  rice and beans you have THE BEST FLAUTA PLATE in the U.S.  -1 star for beef enchilada s. Never had them myself  but my girl had them and they were gross.
Taqueria Arandas,92,First time here  cheap  but really good food. Never ran out of tea  chips so salsa.. Friendly staff. 1 bad thing i had to pay for queso.. should be free with the chips salsa but o well...
Taqueria Arandas,93,I ve had a few different types of tacos  chicken  beef  etc.  and they re decent  but the al Pastor is always solid. The quality varies from okay to great  different cooks    but when it is dialed in this is the best al Pastor taco I ve had in Austin.  I m usually good for 3 tacos w chips and salsa. Unfortunately  I tend to get two al Pastor and try something new for the 3rd. Stick to 3 al Pastor on corn  flour is good  but nothing beats good corn tortillas  and you ll be all set. Tacos are  1.65 and the chips and salsa are free. The chips are mediocre  but the salsa is pretty good.
Taqueria Arandas,94,This is definitely my favorite place to get tacos. It s authentic mexican food and incredibly cheap.  Free chips and salsa as soon as you sit down. Sometimes the chips are stale  but it doesn t even matter because the salsa is so good.   My sister and I come to this location ALL the time. The waitresses are so friendly and only speak in spanish  which I adore about this place. It s never busy and the service is really fast. You can easily be in and out in 30 minutes if need be.
Taqueria Arandas,95,I went to Taqueria Arandas for the first time last week with my roommate. My friend was the only non-Hispanic person there  so I took that as a good sign right off the bat. The waitress came right up to the table to bring us chips and salsa  which were okay  and then back about a minute later to take our food order. Obviously we hadn t had time to look over the menu so we asked for a few minutes. She came back in probably 3  and that s where I m taking away a star. I don t like to be rushed  So I got one chicken  one barbacoa and one al pastor taco  while vegetarian roomie ordered the cheese enchiladas. All of my tacos were FANTASTIC  especially the al pastor. I am a taco fiend and will definitely be back for more. My roommate said the enchiladas were a little too cheesy for her taste and didn t finish her plate. I tried them and thought they were pretty tasty  for just cheese that is .  I ll be bringing my dad here soon as he is always on the hunt for great Mexican food. I ll let you know what he thinks.
Taqueria Arandas,96,Found this place from a recommendation from the front desk at our hotel and the food was really good.  Salsa actually had some kick and the chips were really light and fresh.  All 3 of us really enjoyed our meals.
Taqueria Arandas,97,Ok  this is the first time I ve written a bad review with even the slightest ounce of guilt bc the staff was wicked nice  however the food.....Jesus  um....-cue disturbed look in complete and utter silence while focusing on the nothingness in a VERY dark corner- .........just.....no. Typically   I prefer for my sober dining excursions to take me to places that will provide me with fairly healthy entree options  but I can forego such a preference in order to experience a new venue. It s a risk  if I don t google or yelp it   but I can be a gambling woman on occassion and if the menu selection fails me completely......well  I ll just have a liquid dinner and make a total asshole out of myself. Whiskey on an empty stomach  Always an amaaaaazing default plan. Now  we all know it can be rather challenging to find something healthy at a Mexican food restaurant  but when all else fails....POLLO  That being said  I ordered  Dos tacos de pollo con corn tortillas   which is exactly how I made my request bc they didn t speak much english and honestly  I thoroughly enjoy such a thing. It gives me a chance to stay fresh on my espanol and even though my pronunciation probably leaves me sounding like Peggy from  King of the Hill   f  amp   it  as long as I m understood I feel delicious and foreign. Now  moving on to what WASN T delicious  but sadly enough was probably the most foreign thing I ve ever come across....in a really bad  psyche-damaging kind of way. When my tacos came out  I couldn t help but notice the MASSIVE pile of lettuce on top hiding the true contents of the tacos. I m talking  like....half of a pound. Unusual  Shit  I d say so. When I grabbed my fork and slooooowly pushed the lettuce aside to reveal the feared mystery beneath I immediately thought   Holy Mother Mary of God......what...what the SHIT is in these tortillas   It was like a cheesy horror film where some stupid skank starts screaming in the background while the camera continuously zooms in and out. The piles of shredded carcass lying across my tortillas were comprised of an assortment of colors ranging from  dead  to  alive   bone shards of various length  then polished off w  orange grease and chunks of fat that glistened in the afternoon sky. Son-of-a....-amanda pauses to control regurgitating  yet in this case  pretty much recreating  the taco all over her laptop- Seriously  SERIOUSLY  I mean  what was I even looking at  Chicken  Bird  Rat  Perro .....Pedro  There is no doubt in my mind that the elusive  chicken  that was chosen for this meal was found in a field  beaten w  PVC pipe  de-feathered  Psht  if it even HAD feathers  which if so....thank you  Arandas  for at least doing that much   thrown into the grinder....whole....then placed on my damn tortillas immediately afterwards. I m not gonna lie..........I ate one of the tacos bc I was starving my ass off  but even though I was still ridiculously hungry  I merely nibbled at the surrounding tortilla on the straggling  Chainsaw Massacre  taco feeling really guilty and disturbed by what I had let myself consume. I ll never know what it was  but I do know that I ll never feel right about that meal.   Therapy could be in order. That  or my mother is going to have to get used to really bizarre phones calls from me in the middle of night where I mutter incomprehensible things in both english and spanish while crying profusely.  UPDATE  2 00am strikes and Amanda is sick-as-hell ARG 
Taqueria Arandas,98,When I go here  they know before we tell them that we want 2 chicken tostadas each  an iced tea  green salsa and extra red  but they let us say so in broken Spanish before bringing out the predictably fresh  large and satisfying plates.  I would give it 5 stars based on that experience alone  but I ve tried some other dishes with mixed results.  I no longer bother experimenting - the tostadas never fail me.
Taqueria Arandas,99,this is a nice authentic tex mex restaurant. Good quality food and great service.
Taqueria Arandas,100,When you hear about those great  hole in the wall  kind of places that are better than the flashier  more expensive restaurant - think of this place.  The menu does not have as much variety  but it is good  it s fresh and it s somewhere you can go every week rather than just for special occasions.  That s my kind of restaurant.
Taqueria Arandas,101,Today s lunch at Arandas was  2.91 before tip  I had the Chicken Tostada which comes with beans  cheese  lettuce  avocado and sour cream  and chicken  of course  .   I am gluten free and I ve asked them about it in the past  se habla espanol . I don t ask about the gluten every time  so if you are hyper-vigilant  which you should be   I recommend checking to see if there is any trigo  wheat   harina  flour  or salsa de soya  soy sauce  in the dish. They will look at you like you are crazy  but it s worth it.  Ask for the green salsa in addition to the red - they typically bring out the red only.   Best deal in town.
Taqueria Arandas,102,This place gets its right  especially if you are looking for more authentic Mexican food and not Tex-Mex. The gorditas are my fav  I opt for chicken. Tortas are filling and fantastic. The cheese quesadilla is  died and gone to heaven cheesiness  with a perfectly yummy toasted flour tortilla. My husband loves the menudo  barbacoa and lengua tacos.
Taqueria Arandas,103,These folks are pretty solid.  I ve found that quality can be spotty in most taquerias and I ve definitely seen it here.  When the salsa is on I can eat two bowls.  When it s not  what a drag.  Lately they ve been on all the time.
Taqueria Arandas,104,The chips and salsa were good and we also got a side of guacamole which was also good.  But I must ssy the burrito and mini tacos were not very good.  The beef filling in the burrito tasted like a very cheap cut of meat that they sliced very thin so you could chew it.  The chicken filling in the mini tacos was just ok.  Even at a resonable price I was expecting more.
Taqueria Arandas,105,Spicy salsa here  Ole  Stopped in and had breakfast over the weekend. The staff didn t speak much English but we were able to order and get what we had wanted. The food came out quickly and looked great. I Had the Huevos Rancheros and they were delicious  The Ranchero sauce was bold and flavorful  with the now accustomed heat like the salsa. My dad had the huevos con chorizzo plate and said it was great and that the chorizzo wasn t at all greasy. I think my dad and I got out for around  12 for the both of us and that included two coffees.   All in all I say that they make a quality breakfast and that I ll go back. Just not in my truck because the parking lot is tiny  FYI.
Taqueria Arandas,106,Cheap food  well made  not frills  just a good spot to grab a quick bite.  Been coming for years  love the remodeling and additional parking.  I love the limeade.
Taqueria Arandas,107,Beans have lard in them so I tried to eat around them which is very frustrating. Very limited food choices for a vegetarian. However this place is very cheap if that is what you are looking for.
Taqueria Arandas,108,Went over several times during the holidays and the food is still the best.  Breakfast price can not be beat.  Chorizo and Eggs or Huevos rancheros can not be any better.
Taqueria Arandas,109,This restaurant isn t nearly as good as the one on Burnet Rd.  because of difference in styles and abilities of the cooks.  It s OK  but nothing special.
Taqueria Arandas,110,The real deal.  I  give it 5 stars because bang for buck this place is as good as it gets IMHO.  Most of the customers are native Mexicans and locals who know better. The food is legit.   Service is friendly and efficient. I have been to several here in Austin over the years and they are always good.  Some of the best chorizo in town.  Nothing fancy. A total Mexican immersion experience -  great  cheap  food  complete with an all Mexican jukebox and Mexican soccer on the tv. - you almost forget you are still in the States.
Taqueria Arandas,111,I have been eating at this store for 5 years and it s very good food for the money. You can t beat the price and they give you delicious chips and salsa for free. The wait staff is VERY nice. They do speak spanish and english at this place. My favorite thing to order is the chicken tacos and the quesadillas. 2 people can eat for 10 dollars here - no s  t 
Taqueria Arandas,112,This place is great  authentic mexican food  Great prices  Open all the time  Perfect for end of the night food after drinking  Carne asada tacos are ridiculously good. Can t go wrong here...with anything 
Taqueria Arandas,113,Easily the best Mexican food I ve had for this price. You won t be disappointed.
Taqueria Arandas,114,Great comida Mexicana for the price. Never too busy and always a fast turnaround with your order. Can t go wrong with any of the breakfast plates  or caldos.
Taqueria Arandas,115,Solid pozol  and a tasty michelada every time. Very fast and always fairly good service with a smile.
Taqueria Arandas,116,Have been there twice so far. I loved the pork tacos  so I went again within a week. The 2nd time we went  they totally forgot my boyfriends order  she said  your enchiladas are on the way   then proceeded to walk out the door  I m guessing her shift was over. After about another 10 minutes  we flagged down a waitress and she had no idea we were waiting on another plate  neither did the kitchen. The manager apologized  but we were ready to leave. At least he offered us a free dinner next time. Good food  but obviously sub par service.
Taqueria Arandas,117,So my friends take me here against my will. I sit down  not a very nice staff at all. I get a beef fajita taco and a tostada  it was not good at all. No flavor at all andthe texture was so rubbery. The salsa was some kinda of soupy hotness. nothing was good. too bad...
Taqueria Arandas,118,Hit the spot during our SXSW break between bands. Tacos Al Pastor were great  as yelpvertise-excellent. Waitress was pleasant  service quick  and the flan was fine.
Taqueria Arandas,119,Mmmm.  The breakfast tacos taste of awesome.  I give a 4-star rating for some areas of awesomeness.  First--the price--for breakfast tacos and a breakfast plate  the cost was very inexpensive for the variety of items that we ordered. Now  Secondly--the food flavors and quality were EXCELLENT  pardon the CAPS but the desired effect was hopefully achieved .  We ordered the cactus and eggs plate  and a variety of tacos  I think 9 --all were fantastic. The rancheros sauce was delicioso. The staff are extremely friendly and wicked fast. I was extremely impressed with the experience and I highly recommend you give it a shot.
Taqueria Arandas,120,I have been eating at Arandas since I was a kid. This place is fantastic  The food is incredibly cheap and the waitresses are super nice. I love seeing the place do well and it s crazy to see how diverse the people eating there are. You can t go wrong with their burritos  I prefer beef fajita with cheese added. The chicken tostadas are also great  I love that you can eat a ton and spend  10.00. I have a hard time controlling myself here  so I try not go everyday... but I could.
Taqueria Arandas,121,Good food and ample portions... I had the green chicken enchiladas with a side of guacamole  delicious  and a slice of homemade flan.
Taqueria Arandas,122,This place is bigger inside than it appears outside.  It was nicer inside than we thought it was going to be too. I had the chicken enchiladas verde.  They were okay.  Nice chunks of chicken inside.  I like a little more flavor in my green sauce though.  More garlic. My wife had cheese enchiladas.  She liked them.  I thought they were just okay.  Why don t more places use real cheddar cheese instead of the Velveeta type stuff  Salsa good.  Very attentive helpers.  More than one person checked in on us.  I like that.   We would go back.
Taqueria Arandas,123,Arandas has been a tradition with the Sistah Posse for the last 15 years.  The barbacoa tacos with cheese  cilantro  onions and avocado are to die for - my sister s usual. I always get the chicken flautas with double beans and cheese on the beans.  Mom always gets the migas with double beans. When we let Dad join us  he usually gets the carne asada or the new grilled chicken dish...I think it s called pechuga     . A south Austin standard in my opinion. Try the limeade...super yummy.  The location on Burnet Road is the best one  
Taqueria Arandas,124,Talk about one of the most underrated Mexican places in town. The food is cheap and delivered to you fast. I ordered a combo with consisted of rice  beans and a huge portion of barbacoa and pork for less than  7. Chips and salsa seemingly arrive at your table the moment you sit down and you ll never run out of it due to very prompt service. For a little less you can get a burrito  with all the trimmings for half the price of one you could get at Chipotle  or Free Birds. If you re on a budget and want some delicious homemade Mexican food  there s really no other place than Arandas.
Taqueria Arandas,125,My older brother started taking me to Taqueria Arandas back in the mid 90 s. I  go to taquera arandas probably 2 to 3 times a year. All the food that i have ever received from taqueria arandas was greasy and bland. Granted their prices are cheap and the portions are plentiful. I can tell that most of the waiters hate there jobs. I understand this because too  am a waiter.  If you order the beef tacos they will not have any seasoning on them  so they taste as if you cooked them in a pan. There only plus is that they are open really late hours other than that i probably would never go there.   On the other hand my girlfriend likes Taqueria arandas because of the margarita s and that s it.
Taqueria Arandas,126,LOVE all the Arandas  but this location is my favorite.  Plenty of parking  comfortable decor and a super fast staff.  You absolutely can t beat the price  I grew up on Mexican food and its nice to be at a restaurant that isn t trying to convince me a taco with beans a cheese is worth  5.    Jukebox also has a great selection  not usually something I look for in a restaurant but I can t help noticing every time I m there that the music is great.  Usually when I order to-go at  a taco place I have a drink while I wait  here I barely have time to take a sip and they have my food ready.  So glad this place exists.
Taqueria Arandas,127,Only four stars  but this really is one of my all-time favorites. By all means  this place should probably just be a 3 star  but the value of what you get here for the price just completely makes it worth it. I love the beef fajita or al pastor burritos. I get them with avocado and meat only  no beans or lettuce  and that s really my favorite way to have them. You have to try one that way. I also rip off a lot of unwanted tortilla  those things wrapping the burrito are huge and it s too much . Also  if you want a great chorizo and egg plate  this is one of the best. Two people can eat here for less than  10 if you eat light  but easily under  20 and you ll be stuffed. I always insist on getting their green salsa  they don t always offer it  because I just absolutely love it. It is made fresh so it is always a little different from day to day. But when it s just right... mmm. The wait staff doesn t speak much english  but they are very good about being attentive. Don t be alarmed when the tejano jukebox comes on randomly after you ve been there for several minutes. It does that.
Taqueria Arandas,128,This is my go-to place after a night of heavy drinking. Consistent  good food  quick service. Huevos rancheros and chicken tacos are some my favorites  but definitely try the carne guisada - SOOO damn good   Oh and everything is ridiculously cheap  which is really nice after spending a ton on drinks the night before   
Taqueria Arandas,129,Great for breakfast  lunch  or dinner. Always the same friendly waitresses  always good consistent food. The verde enchiladas are good  the migas are awesome  the carne asada is great  and the menudo is hard to beat in town.
Taqueria Arandas,130,This my favorite hole in the wall Mexican food   they are always busy - large portions  fresh produce  real cheap best bang for your buck. the wait staff has seemingly not changed in at least 8 years and it is nice to see all of the renovations they have done to the place since my wife and I have started to go there.  quality experience - get the carne asada with nopaitos  its awesome
Asador,1,These are some of the best tacos I ve ever had in Austin. The tortillas are buttery and amazing. The smoked brisket was smoky and tender  with just the right amount of delicious fat and grease. The chicken taco with the melted cheese was devine and one of the best tacos I ve ever had. This spot is amazing. It is hidden in the back of Buford s Bar  don t miss it 
Asador,2,I had tried the one at Bufords Friday night. I had gotten a brisket quesadilla  chicken taco and chips queso for  34.    It was all entirely way too salty....chips included  so I threw it away after a bite or two of each. Although I m sure that other locations may have better Luck  I personally will not  drive from north Austin to try it again.
Asador,3,Ok I ve had asador at both locations now  and while I think they probably were incredible when they first opened  now they re slinging en masse for the bar crowds and the quality control has gone downhill. The tortillas and salsas were very good  the meats were okay - bit dry. Honestly I told my friend she should have taken the queso back. Not only was it actively cold when we got it  I also think there was something wrong with it. It had a very funky sour note to it  like beer cheese. The chips were delightful  fried perfectly crispy and well seasoned. It ll do if you find yourself in Buford s  which I try not to   but personally after my experience I would recommend others to go to One Taco down the street at Little Woodrow s instead.
Asador,4,Let me tell about this  6 tacos.  Brisket was Rich in flavor  toasted flour tortilla   the carnitas was simply not carnitas plain no seasoning very little meat as well on both.  Staff was rude  requested some ice with our coke and simply decline saying the coke is cold enough. Bathrooms were clean and patio was enjoyable.
Asador,5,Amazing food  The meat was so tender and flavorful. I could tell the guacamole was extremely fresh which I appreciated. Tortillas are perfect  The queso had an amazing kick to it  Order the chicken quesadilla and the brisket nachos 
Asador,6,The brisket and carnitas tacos are really really good - especially with a decent slather of the green sauce that helps cut a little of the fattiness. Then again  the only thing preventing this from getting to 5 stars is that it  is  fatty. Mind you  given what it is  you expect it to be fatty  but then again  my liver is still in a little bit of shock a few hours later.   Still  excellent tacos  and given that you re in Buford s  you can order a pint of  expensive   beer  chill  watch football on the screen  if that s your thing  and eat your tacos.   Note  the chips  optional. expensive  are deeply fried  and not particularly good...
Asador,7,These are the tacos we ve been craving for the last 4 years.  Yes  we re from CA and have been missing street tacos. I love ALL tacos so not hating on Austin tacos. Don t come   me lol .  We ordered the chicken and brisket tacos. They were  6 each which is pricy but they were bigger than your average.  The flavor was on point. Tortillas were fresh. The two guys at the stand  we went to the Las Perlas location  were friendly and cranked em out quick. I was surprised with how great everything was considering their set up was basically a taco stand.  The chips are SO good. The chile salt is where it s at.  But  9 for chips and guac is a bit offensive haha thankfully they gave us extra chips since we still had guac left. Not my favorite guac. I d recommend just ordering the chips.   That food coupled with our delicious drinks from Las Perlas had us excited for our next visit.   TIP  you order through Toast tab so if you expect it to be busy when you visit  you could order it 10-15 min in advance from arriving so you get your order sooner.
Asador,8,Great tacos  The meat is really the star of the show. Served like traditional street tacos but bigger.
Asador,9,Best tacos I ve had. Not sure how they stack up with other tacos in Texas as it s all I had time for  but they were delicious  The salsa and guacamole was a hit as well.
Asador,10,Very small  unassuming taco stand in the middle of a brilliant concept of three specialty bars. I had the brisket and carnitas tacos. The brisket was more like a taco stand barbacoa  which was amazing   and the carnitas shined through with a rich  sage like flavor that I had never experienced. I m used to citrus  white pepper  and garlic as a mojo style carnitas  but this was an unexpected surprise. Thank you for making my experience tremendous. Top notch  and absolutely matched the caliber of the cocktail and bar service that it accompanied. I couldn t recommend this more. I wish I had more time in Austin to appreciate this place on a weekly level. I assume it s spectacular for events  as well. Five stars all the way to this whole establishment.
Asador,11,Very nice taco spot on Rainey. Seating is right on the street and off street. Tacos were filling and not skimpy. The bar in the back is a little gem too.
Asador,12,Got a chicken taco  the chicken was hard   also not sure if Austin knows what a cheese quesadilla is supposed to be. Got some chips and salsa with queso  for 10 bucks the queso was worth 2 bucks. Wife had a catfish taco  which she said was good. Overall for the price and the food I give this place 2  only because of the catfish taco.
Asador,13,These are some of the best tacos I ve ever had at a food truck. Five stars for highly exceeding my expectations  but I knocked it down a star  because it s a little pricey. The chicken tacos and brisket tacos are my favorite  and they also have house-made chips  which is huge. They have an online app  so you can order 20 minutes prior to getting there  and then the food is ready when you arrive. I moved close by  and am thankful I did. This has quickly become my go-to spot for watching football games during the week.
Asador,14,Overall  Hidden inside Seven Grand  First off  this place was hella hard to find lol bc it is located inside the bar Seven Grand. When you go in  it s all the way in the back outside   FOOD  super delicious for the late night munchies. We got four tacos - carnitas  chorizo  quesadilla  and barbacoa. And they were amazing  My favorites being the carnitas and barbacoa. The great thing is that they make their own tortilla. The texture of the tortilla was slightly crispy  which I thoroughly enjoyed. Can be considered pricey since 4 tacos were like  20.   SERVICE AMBIANCE  I will say it took a while to get the tacos  granted there was only one dude making them . People working there were super friendly and chill. Very dimly lit place inside while outside there is a lot of space with heat lamps to keep warm.
Asador,15,The place was empty and I should ve followed my heart...  I never choose a place with low reviews and this time I gave it the benefit of the doubt... BIG MISTAKE... tacos and guacamole salty  no forks to cut the quesadilla for my small child. Staff seem they didn t want to be bothered. Don t waste your time.
Asador,16,I tried every taco and they were all fantastic  Unique flavors  balanced flavors  just right portions. Come here  get one of everything  thank me later.
Asador,17,What a hidden gem for Austin.  As you walk through  the bar and reach the outside patio  you see a grill top and a bunch of coolers.  I was expecting a very average taco based on the setup but let me start by telling you  this is no average taco spot.   We placed our order and after the guy was done charging us  he turned around and started prepping the tacos.  It took about 5 or 6 minutes but the order is brought to you while you drink.   The moment you take a bite  you can taste the freshness. From the home made tortillas  to the perfectly cooked and marinated meat inside.  Topped with just the right amount of onions and peppers to make your mouth water.   All of this for   3 each  and you make the perfect spot.  I will definitely be back here again 
Asador,18,Great tacos  But you eat what they have.   No carne Asadi   No ropa vieja .   We have ground beef   Yes  excellent ground beef tacos  3.5 a piece . I did love em.    Chips were mildly greasy like they were made in. House. Salsa was all sauce.   Food was great   But you eat what you are served.   4 star tacos. 2 star process-tacos desk is at the back of 7 Gand Whiskey Bar.   Nice people. Good food. But the system needs tweaking. Still  might be back tomorrow. I like tacos  enjoy whiskey and the people are nice.
Asador,19,Low key and amazing. Legit. Solid. Late night. Whiskey  . Advanced. Extra. Happiness via a drunken text. Just do it. You re welcome.
Asador,20,Had the brisket taco and it was one of the best tacos I ve ever had  Very filling and juicy and the tortillas were crispy but soft at the same time. I am in my happy place. Will definitely be back.
Asador,21,The employees of Asador are the biggest jerks. Paid  32 for 9 tacos that were barely filled up and not even good quality. Wouldn t pay  32 again for these small tacos. Had higher expectations. Tried to get a refund  that s when their rude personality came out. They threw the refund money at me  had to pick up from floor . Rude service  bad quality. Not all service industries workers are heros
Asador,22,I tried their mushroom quesadillas tonight. It has some traces of pumpkin in it which I thought was quite interesting. Anyways they was pretty good. I thought for the quesadillas they were slightly overpriced  but I guess this is downtown we re talking about. The flavor was great  comes with salsa on the side as it should. Decently filling. They apparently can only be ordered online which got on my nerves because I would rather just swipe my card. Overall 7 10.
Asador,23,THESE ARE THE BEST TACOS IN TOWN   Get the brisket taco. You will absolutely die. An absolute hidden gem behind the bar Pelons    3 tacos  Best in town hands down.
Asador,24,Amazing Mexican brunch    Would highly recommend the chorizo w poached egg   Will definitely return 
Asador,25,The brisket taco was one of the best things I ve put in my mouth. The brisket itself is super moist  flavorful  and slightly spicy. Tortillas are homemade. My mouth is so happy right now.
Asador,26,Holy moly  best tacos ever would be an understatement. I didn t really think much of this place  I thought the entrance was very boujie but the shop is actually in the back on an outside patio. I had the crispy carnita tacos  smoked brisket tacos  and the quesadilla. Each were so fresh  and literally cooked perfectly. Not sure how they did the tortilla but it tasted amazing    My favorite were the pork carnita tacos  11 10 would recommend. It is a little on the greasier side but I didn t mind it at all. I ordered seconds of it just bc it was so good.  ORDER THEIR TACOS     
Asador,27,KC traveler hitting up Austin. Found Asador on yelp near my hotel  and I needed tacos. When in Austin  right  And i just love tacos. Deep down  would make my one food level love. Off i went in Austin s downtown in search of my tacos.   I walked in through Las Perlas  and grabbed a Oaxacan Las Perlas Margarita  5   would drink again . Then i wandered to the patio  looked at the menu  and said  screw it  one of everything.  6 tacos were on my way.   It s a one person show  so exercise patience. It s worth it. So worth it. Srsly. In food ecstasy  I lost track of what i was eating.   So go. Grab a margarita on your way through  get one of everything  and live your best taco life.
Asador,28,This the best tacos in Austin Texas I ve ever tasted  Full of flavor  The meat was juicy and the tortilla was perfectly toasted 
Asador,29,Asador should be in the contending of best tacos in Austin. The service is always friendly and the tacos can t be beat. Be adventurous with your order  everything on the menu is worth trying. Will be coming back again and again.
Asador,30,Amazing tacos  They re a bit pricey  but some of THE BEST pollo asado tacos I ve ever had.  I don t eat beef or pork  so I know good chicken tacos lol.  So flavorful and juicy. I highly recommend getting them with cheese - they put it on the tortilla first so it s melty and delicious.
Asador,31,Great food but the location is inside and in the back of another location  so heads up. Also don t walk 7th street alone during the night time  I went for dinner around 8pm. Aside all that the food is very good. I had the Pollo asado taco  and the smoked brisket taco which were both delicious. I have to say that the pollo asado was my favorite of the two. I would definitely recommend it 
Asador,32,Been in Austin for 3 days and this was the best taco place we found. It s like a secret hideout in the back of a bar with a guy cooking tacos on a grill. It Amazing  If you re in Austin you need to try this place.
Asador,33,Tacos are an essential part of Austin culture  and Asador has become a go to. Beyond the standard menu  the specials are fantastic. While a typical Austin taco relies on a blend of ingredients to achieve a good taco  Asador achieves an amazing taco by focusing on quality ingredients paired with amazing spices. The mole tacos  brisket  amp  mushroom  are amazing and a trip to Seven Grand or Las Perlas is not complete with at least one  or more  tacos.   Cheers to the guys who make this my goto taco spot   
Asador,34,Wow  These tacos were fantastic. We couldn t find the place at first because it s located behind the bar but I m so glad we didn t give up. We had the chorizo  pollo and beef and all three were delicious. The amount of food this place was pumping out was crazy and it was all fresh. There was one cook and one waitress hostess cashier and they were busting their backs getting after it to deliver one of the best food experiences I have ever had and I ve had some good ones 
Asador,35,We were not thrilled. The food was alright. The staff was also pretty good. I ll try them next week.
Asador,36,My friends and I were struck dumb by how good these tacos were. Considering its rather nondescript location behind a bar  we were expecting average tacos and instead were surprised and delighted to find some of the best--if not the best--tacos we ve had in Austin. The corn tortillas are perfect  the meat is flavorful yet crispy  the ingredients and spices are quality. While many taco places in Austin rely on wacky concoctions  Asador knocks it out of the park with simple recipes done 100 percent right.
Asador,37,These guys make some of the most authentic  savory  and delicious tacos I have ever had. You absolutely won t be disappointed. Also try it Gringo Style which includes queso added.
Asador,38,We were looking for handmade tortillas so we checked this place out. It was a one man show on monday night so service was slow. We ordered chorizo  beef  and chicken. The tortillas were good but the meat was way too salty. Also the guac was salty too  not sure how or the tortilla chips had too much salt . Wouldnt recommend it.
Asador,39,Lit barbacoa  probably the only reason I m at this fancy mescal bar.
Asador,40,Perfectly cooked  perfectly seasoned and spiced  creative while remaining authentic  and priced appropriately  These are legit the best tacos in Austin...if you ve only ever had bullshit white people tacos with a bunch of nonsense all over them that cost  6  I implore you to go to Asador.
Asador,41,This place is located in the courtyard behind Las Perlas. I ordered the mushroom taco in mole Amarillo and the quesadilla with queso oaxaque a. Both were amazing and unlike anything else the city has to offer. The mushrooms are mixed with the perfect combination of mole Amarillo and the quesadilla is brilliant in its simplicity. And all tortillas are made fresh in house and are cooked to perfection. If you re looking for the next great taco in Austin  this is your spot.
Asador,42,Had dinner last night. The pollo asado was excellent and the special was insane. I especially like the tortillas  they re definitely grilled or something ahead of time and aren t floppy  damp tortillas you might get elsewhere. Owner was friendly and happy to serve. Had drinks in La Perlas while we waited. 10 10 would return 
Asador,43,Great service and excellent tacos. Being behind Las Perlas and Seven Grand  they re a perfect addition.
Asador,44,Great tacos and great service  They re nestled in the back of Las Perlas and goes perfect with the drinks.
Asador,45,So we re in town at an event on 6th St  got hungry walked like 3 seconds over to 7th St... couldn t find this lil slice of heav n.  Walked through a Mezcal bat and boom Taco Paradise    Just go order one of everything and smile
Asador,46,Absolutely love this spot  A little hard to find  but that s part of what makes it fun. I don t live in Austin but make sure to go to Asador every time I m in town and take people with me to share the love. There s something about the tortillas that is just amazing and love that the meat options are different each time.
Asador,47,Try the chips and salsa  Quite delightful and a good pairing with the mezcal next door.
Asador,48,A tortilla press  a cooler  and a grill walk into a bar. The bartender says  holy shit  these are some great fuckin tacos.
Asador,49,Tasty ass tacos   Perfect place to be for bar munchies.  Definitely recommend for anyone visiting Seven Grand.
Asador,50,Amazing tacos. Get the guac if you get chips. These guys will literally never disappoint you. If you come to them with a request  concern  or personal problem  they take that ish in stride and deliver the highest quality feelinqueso  read  tacos  known to man. Literal saviors of humankind via 7th street. Personal goals have been set after meeting their kind. Asador is the level achieved post-self actualization. Indulge yourself. Eat tacos. Believe.
Asador,51,I hate to be that person but I m gonna be that person  I was born and raised here and we all know that somehow being a unicorn and living here your entire life   eating tacos or some variation of them approximately 3 meals a week kinda sorta maybe makes you some kind of authority on the subject. And if not  then the sheer volume of tacos I ve eaten in this lifetime should give me some kind of credibility. I ve had tacos from damn near everywhere in this town 3x over and again. There are some real gems out here  and some really over hyped crap too . But these tacos....these tacos are the best. I don t even know where to start  so I won t. But as a teaser  true taco lovers know the tortilla will always have the potential to be a deal breaker. Fear not  These tortillas are the bomb. With more bomb stuff on  em  Discovering this place was like the first time I discovered HEB sold fresh  real  handmade tortillas some mornings at select locations for all my amateur taco making needs. You re welcome  new peeps - life changing. If the package has a label on it  you grabbed the wrong thing. Follow the scent of deliciousness towards the bakery and look for a bag that s still warm . And re  a previous reviewer - yes  they do run out of ingredients sometimes. Welcome to Austin and being served real food  From a food STAND  With...wait for it...limited capacity  If you want stuff that s always available then go to Taco Bell to get down on dat good good that certainly ain t fresh and certainly ain t real. Also  brisket tacos are far superior to carne asada  it s asada  not asadi for those of you new to Tejas . Also for the record  tacos behind a whiskey bar is like a glorious dream come true. Anyway  for you patient taco enthusiasts out there who support small businesses and like indulging in great booze while scarfing down awesome food  go get  em  Get there early. Relish in euphoria. And the guac. Like I-don t-even-need-chips-for-this-guac-it s-so-good kinda guac.
Baby Acapulco,1,Man I love this place   Almost always have the Baby A s soup.  Not only the food and drinks.  But  watching this crew tonight work together.... a restaurant with the GM sweeping the floor and busing tables.  NO drama.  Pleasant and relaxing atmosphere for a night out.   Love love love
Baby Acapulco,2,Food was awful. My margarita was made from mix and extremely sweet. The only decent thing that we got were the asada tacos which is pretty difficult to mess up.
Baby Acapulco,3,Great service and clean restaurant. Atmosphere is fun. Drinks were good and strong. However the food was awful. Probably the worst I have had at a Mexican restaurant. The enchiladas were so salty they were had to eat. The huevos were flavorless. I wouldn t recommend eating here. Drinks with friends and family yes.
Baby Acapulco,4,Baby ain t so bad. A welcoming  large  Cantina style Mexican restaurant in the hotel and shopping district of Domain.   The outdoor deck patio is large and well shaded. The service is efficient and friendly. The music can be a bit tacky  e.g.  Boyz to Men  though it adds to the informal vibe.  The food is average--not bad but nothing to write home about. I had the grilled Acupulco Fish Tacos  fried is another option . Good blackened flavor  just not exceptionally fresh or high quality ingrediants. The house salsa was smooth while standard and not entirely memorable.   If you re looking for an informal atmosphere with plenty of seating  Acupulco may speak baby talk to you.
Baby Acapulco,5,Do NOT go to Baby Acapulco - Baby A s off Stone lake blvd  across r the Arboretum    There toilet literally exploded toilet water all over me when I flushed it. Not a little water  we re talking the force of the water actually pushed me back into the door of the stall     There was No marker  No sign  nothing saying the stall was broken or out of order. No clue.    I enter this tiny stall  lock the door  pee  go to flush and BAM    Water shooting high speed out of the toilet onto me while I m trapped in this tiny ass stall.  Yes  I initially screamed because the shock and force of this mini flash flood of exploding toilet water aimed directly at me in a tiny locked stall....  After I had a minute to process  I was angry and collected myself as best I could. I called for the manager from my cell phone in the bathroom   she walks in as I have my hands full of paper towels and standing in an inch of water covering the floor of the bathroom and  she says -  Oh yeah  we had someone out this morning it was supposed to be fixed. Do you want me to get you a towel or something  ....     I was in shock. I look at her   paper towels in hand  clothes soaked  and say  no but you can get me a refund.  She says  okay    well the plumber was here this morning and they said it was fixed .  and she walks out.  No apology  nothing.   She tried to just comp my food and not my drink...  Seriously     Lady  I m covered in toilet water and your entire bathroom floor is covered in water      She finally says she will refund everything  supposedly  we ll see...  Never go to Baby Acapulco Stonelake Blvd. Austin Texas.  Not only are the facilities dirty and broken but the manager is awful       Note to the manager - you should have said  I am so sorry. You re entire meal and single drink is comped. How else can we make this right  .     Baby A s at Stonelake - I fully expect a full refund.
Baby Acapulco,6,Good. Nothing wrong with that but it s just good Tex-mex food. Nothing particularly amazing about it. Service was ok but they were so slow that I think the staff was bored. It s a huge restaurant that seems like it s being wasted. Could be a great place to hang out and eat but needs to step up it s game especially for the money.
Baby Acapulco,7,I have eaten here several times in the past year and last night being the most recent. Why it is not more crowded I have no idea except people have not rediscovered it. I used to go to Baby A s in the 90s and loved it but in the late 99s I found their food not so good and cleanliness subpar. WELL NOW THEY ARE BACK     At least at this location  I love it  I crave it  Service is exceptional  Food is flavorful and fresh  Best place in town for queso too  Serving size is perfect  Quesadillas can t be beat  Tortilla soup  puffy taco are omg  The rest of the menu is real good too. Yea is fresh  Margarita menu has the usual offerings and a few unique to This restaurant. Go    
Baby Acapulco,8,I am a service connected 100  disabled veteran first responder. I arrived at 6pm today at Baby A s Stonelake Austin. There is NO handicap parking and I m on 8ltrs oxygen with little time left in life. There are no other cars parked near either entrance and I ve witnessed only 2 others pull in since the manager  Carlos came out to where I tried parking close enough to get inside on my own w o use of my transport wheelchair  which must be pushed by attendant . Carlos refused to assist in wheeling me into the restaurant  claiming he was too busy. I m appalled at the lack of compassion of this individual  What has become of common courtesy or even pride to represent the establishment your income is generated from  Needless to say I won t be dining nor referring anyone here ever.
Baby Acapulco,9,Great good and reasonably priced but it s just way to understaffed. You have a server doing both serving and barrending. Waited 10  minutes for a drink.
Baby Acapulco,10,Goddamn this place is awful  Not only is the food garbage but the service is even worse. Frozen Mexican TV dinners are more edible than the shit they call food. How it has stayed in business for so long is anyone s guess 
Baby Acapulco,11,Mediocre food at best. Store bought chips and tortillas. The enchiladas were overly salty as were the refried beans. They ve basically got a two drink max. They have a point system with their drinks and once you reach 6 points your cut off. So two margaritas max. Not a place to Uber to for drinks with friends.  On the positive side  they re pretty cheap. The salsa with the chips was good. Regardless  there are better Mexican food and drink options in town. Not worth giving this place a second look.
Baby Acapulco,12,Hi Lisa  I ll tell you why  most  of the loyal customers have stopped coming here. They treat the local with  cold  food. I ve been coming here for 16 years and they have continued to decline in service and food. Maybe you get a hit or miss with who ever is cooking for the day however  I continue to visit random days and times and for the last 3 months  I ve been served cold food. I like purples  however today it truly happened. They are a LOT weaker than the originals. Don t waste the    I wonder why the Mgr. doesn t care. The workers don t care. The chef is new and eats the food hot I bet instead of serving it hot to the customers. I purposely did not attach photos  because I believe someone should come in  amp  turn this place around     Help them Jesus
Baby Acapulco,13,Service is bad. They aren t up front about their to go alcohol policy. But at least I didn t have to spend extra on a tip.   Edit  order To go was also incorrect and missing items. Imagine that. Needs better waitstaff and management.   Won t be back.
Baby Acapulco,14,Baby Acapulco is exactly why their rating reflects. Generic Tex-Mex food that is just a little bit more expensive than it should be. Lots of options when it comes to gimmicky festive margaritas  10 beer taps and a full bar. If You re in the area and want to drink or want a place with a fun vibe to hang out with friends baby A s is great. If it s date night and or your craving Mexican food there is about 100 other places in Austin that or better scratch that itch.
Baby Acapulco,15,Needed a fun place in a pinch to celebrate a lifetime of service  gathering of 40 people to enjoy lunch and fellowship. The staff here responded in a day s time and hosted a wonderful event. The food was wonderful and the margaritas were delicious. Thanks to all the staff that made it happen.
Baby Acapulco,16,First stop at this location in some time and it s hard not to overweight COVID effects to it  but I ll try.  Baby A s is always a good pick for Mexican food in Austin.  Is it the best   Probably not.  Are there worse   Absolutely.  It balances quality with price and a great atmosphere to enjoy Mexican food with groups small or large.  This one is located near the Arboretum area near the confluence of Capitol of TX Hwy  360   MoPac  1  and US-183.  Not very visible from any of the major roads so you will need to know the turns or use your preferred navigation approach.  That being said  it puts the location away from other establishments and so it has its own parking lot and doesn t have that feeling like you d have if you go to a restaurant in a mall or large shopping center.  Easy in and out and plenty of parking.  The restaurant is large.  Sprawling indoor and outdoor seating.  For COVID  limited capacity so lots of empty tables with even a 20 minute wait  advertised at 30 minutes  always over-estimate to your customers  pro tip .  Good indoor atmosphere in terms of decor  kitsch or not  you can call .  Very open with high ceilings  large and small tables  and more intimate areas where you don t feel you re in a large restaurant.  Booths or tables  your preference.  For COVID  limited menu  one page front and back no including separate drink menu .  A few items in each of the main categories  enchiladas  tacos  fajitas  mixed plates  etc .  No problem finding what you like if you like this type of food.  That being said  my dad got a hamburger.  Because he wanted a hamburger.  It looked good and he liked it.  I got the nachos appetizer as a meal and wasn t disappointed.  Instead of a large mound of chips with everything piled on  they were thicker chips about the size of half a crispy taco with the main ingredients on each  then a dallop of guacamole  sour cream  pico  and pile of jalapenos to flavor each.  Was perfect and tasted good.  I got the ground beef  they also had  chicken  fajita meat or veggie.  The service was a bit slow.  My feeling was they were short staffed.  In fact we were seated and after some time of nobody taking our drink order  our hostess jumped in to get us drinks...and by then we were ready to order so she took that too.  Drinks came out medium to slow  maybe 5 minutes for waters and a draft beer .  Later the server came flying in to introduce herself and ask if we needed anything  then got reasonably attentive service thereafter.  I wouldn t deduce a star because of this and the busyness of the Friday night  but just noteworthy.  I feel like anytime you go out to eat in COVID times  additional patience is cumpulsory.  Everyone is working hard  no indication our server wasn t she just didn t get to us very quickly  So all in all  a good experience.  I wouldn t put this at the top of my Austin Mexican food list but certainly would drop in here again if convenient.  Which is about my definition for 3 stars.
Baby Acapulco,17,This place is just really run down. The food was okay but the atmosphere was not great. The restaurant Itself almost felt dirty. Not good enough to come here again.
Baby Acapulco,18,Excellent food  I had the Chile con queso which was delicious  great tortillas and salsa and then the soup was excellent. Will recommend to anyone. . John served my table and he was great.
Baby Acapulco,19,We had a yelp perk to go to at the theater nearby  so we decided to try Baby A s out. They do have their own parking lot and the place itself has a lot of room. There is a bar  plenty of seating  TVs  amp  outdoor seating as well. You will be greeted by a host then be seated. Our server was Cesar and he made the experience all the better with his personality and jokes. I add a star just for a server being great at their job and making me laugh.   I was interested in trying a margarita but noticed they looked like they re all frozen but there are a few that come on the rocks. He was nice enough to have us try their famous purple margarita to which is said to be the strongest there. I asked him which are on the rocks then he mentioned a watermelon one and stopped him there. lol The watermelon margarita on the rocks was so delicious and you can taste bits of watermelon too .   They give you some chips  amp  salsa that are good. I ordered flautas plate  amp  hubby ordered beef enchiladas. They were good but nothing to rave about and I was expecting at least four of them but got three flautas with rice and beans. The enchiladas were two of them.   I would return for some margaritas and maybe if i m in the area Ill order some food. Its great for big groups  amp  having a drink.
Baby Acapulco,20,I enjoyed the food and company tonight at Baby A s  I tried their famous strong purple margarita and I wasn t feeling it  tasted like grape dimetapp  in my opinion . I may have to try the Superman marg next time. I got a regular frozen  some queso and also the Brisas Bowl with grilled shrimp  avocado  and a sweet habanero sauce. The puffy tacos also look good  It s a popular spot with a few locations around Austin.
Baby Acapulco,21,I am actually surprised for bad reviews on service   I dono if I was just lucky today but our server was really polite  prompt and friendly. Food was just okay but very reasonably priced. Nice big patio seating for those who seek social distancing
Baby Acapulco,22,They charge you twice for meals. Servers are incompetent. Food is shit  Horrible service. Would not advise going there 
Baby Acapulco,23,I just want to start off by saying that I ve never been the person to leave a review online  I m rather the one reading the reviews. But for the wonderful time I had last night I feel like I had to say something  I want to take time and appreciate my server Stephanie who attended us with Hospitality and a friendly attitude. She gave us all the attention we needed and had our food delivered right on time  I could see her smile through her mask  I got everything I wanted from a Restaurant experience at Baby A s. Should be a 5 star restaurant with their Waitress Stephanie in the house. Thanks for the experience and we ll make sure to come again 
Baby Acapulco,24,Baby A s certainly has a reputation for getting people drunk with their purple margarita  but I m here to tell you there s more to Baby A s...  Important takeaways  Great service Pretty decent food  if you know what to order  Okay fine  they have great Margaritas  Service - every time my fianc e and I go to Baby A s we sit in the bar area and everyone who has helped us has been so attentive  friendly  and welcoming. Cody is most often working when we come in and he barely needs to ask us what we want at this stage  but does so out of courtesy.   The food - it s not the best food in Austin but damn if they don t have one of my favorite meals in the world. BABY A S SOUP Y ALL   It s like chicken tortilla soup and pho had a baby. Chicken tortilla soup  but better  in flavor and pho in construction. You re served a base of broth with chicken and avocado in it and a side plate of crispy tortilla strips  red onion  cilantro  shredded cheese  and a lime wedge to make the soup your own. It s like a hug in a bowl and it s the best thing on their menu hands down.   Honorable mention to my fianc e s favorite meal of the amores tacos - that green amores sauce is the BEST.   All of their other food is pretty standard tex mex and is nothing mind blowing but it s definitely good enough to venture away from the soup  a rare occasion for me .   Margs - everyone knows Baby A s has some wild frozen margarita options. What s great about them in my opinion is the consistency. There s never an off day  they are always delicious  not too sweet  and have the right strength. My fave is the mango  they clearly use a pur e or something instead of syrup and artificial flavors like other places and it shows. It s not electric orange and it actually tastes like a mango  Its my go-to every time.   Overall Baby A s is a solid choice for food  drinks  and a good time and deserves more respect than it gets 
Baby Acapulco,25,Sebastian at Baby Acapulcos is an amazing server  This was my fianc  and I s first time here and we had a fantastic experience  The manager Carlos was also very kind and honored a military discount for my fianc  who is active duty at the moment  The food was very delicious and the purple margarita is AMAZING  10 10 
Baby Acapulco,26,My friend and I met for dinner at BabyA s.  It was a busy night and like most businesses these days  they were short staffed.  After waiting a few minutes  somewhat annoyed  I flagged down a server and asked when we would be waited on.  She  Liz  immediately apologized for the wait  which really wasn t that long  and Liz said she could help us.  I don t consider myself as high maintenance but my friend and I made many requests.  Liz graciously assisted us with kindness.  I will come back to Baby A s specifically because of the customer service and hospitality of our server Liz as well as the awesome food and drinks.  Thank you for the great service and awesome food 
Baby Acapulco,27,I take a lot of issue when a restaurant s drink prices are at or higher than the entrees. I came in tonight at 8 27pm knowing they were closing soon but I had time to eat and drink a couple cocktails. I got a patron margarita and it was okay but absolutely not worth the money. My stuffed avocado arrived with a cold center of shredded chicken. Super disappointing. I tried a mezcal margarita and it was alright but I would never pay more than  8 for it  it was  12.99 . Service was awkward and I now know why this place has fallen off.
Baby Acapulco,28,Their drinks are always on point. I love all of those damn frozen cocktails. This location is awesome. Grab some good food and head across the street for a movie.
Baby Acapulco,29,I believe this place has been closed. Went here on a Friday night at 8 30pm and they were closed. No one in sight. No one answered the phone.
Baby Acapulco,30,As of today this will be my last time visiting this place.. Customer service has completely gone down hill. I have been coming here for at least 10 years. This year the turn over rate has been very noticeable especially at the bar.  I was coming here mostly everyday after work but that has come to a complete stop today.   Word to the wise when you or should i say your bartender comes to work with an attitude and treats people like they could be doing something better with their time then taking care of the customer  that s the first sign that maybe a change of venue is needed.  When I come in and sit myself at the bar 10 minutes before the next customers sit themselves  I expect to be serviced first   not when you feel like serving me. If you feel like throwing the napkin and the straw on the bar just remember I m not your dog or someone that you dislike.... I m am a paying customer...   Although my business will not be missed I m pretty sure you will manage to run off some other customers...By the way I m not the only regular who has experience these episodes.   When I bring this to the attention of management I would normally expect some kind of professional response but that was not the case in this situation..  I m a customer experience manager for a pretty large corporation and If i were to ever hear of or see any team member treating a customer in this manner  we would have a very long talk that would probably end in termination.   To my understanding this very employee has had complaints before but the employee is still there.
Baby Acapulco,31,Baby  a s.... Disappointing  You walk in the door greeted by sewer septic aroma. Nice  right  Skinny margarita  no natural ingredients used except for the tequila. It should be fresh squeezed lime juice  agave nectar or simple syrup. Have no idea what I received. Unacceptable margarita. Food  mediocre at best. Piling cheese on sub par food doesn t make it more appealing nor palatable . Menu limited. It sucks to be traveling on business  with limited restaurant choices   and most are sub par. Prices have also increased   My salary hasn t. Chains... I should know better. I will NOT be back.
Baby Acapulco,32,This has become my family s go to for happy hour gatherings. Tonight was my mother s birthday day celebration which was great  Can t beat happy hour appetizers and drinks for a bday celebration   A few rounds of nachos  amores tacos  drinks  and a few entrees made a perfect Thursday evening perfect. We had Shelly as our server and she was friendly  funny  quick and checked on us often. She even offered to take a family picture for us around my mom s bday cake which we thought was super nice of her. Thank you Shelly for making my mother birthday celebration all the more Special  We ll be back again and again 
Baby Acapulco,33,A stepped version of Chuy s. Great drinks  great food and great dessert  Baby As is an Austin classic 
Baby Acapulco,34,Came by on a whim with some friends for a quick bite.  This place is soooooo spacious  PLENTY of seating  I think the food portions are decent and the prices are moderate.  We sat by the bar and were helped by the bartender who was courteous and great at making our drinks    so glad I got to try their purple margaritas that are so famous
Baby Acapulco,35,Ordered a Jerry s burrito.  Looks and tastes identical to a Taco Bell Burrito  except in this case it s 15 dollars.  Waiter said it would be 5 dollars more for steak.  That means20 bucks for a Taco Bell quality taco.  Won t be back
Baby Acapulco,36,Great fish tacos. Skinny margarita was tasty. Live band Bubba Coltrane was awesome and our server Kate really took care of us - and there were a lot of us   
Baby Acapulco,37,My first time here and I wasn t impressed. My friend and I had to look around for a waiter to ask where we could sit. We sat down for five minutes before our server asked us to order. Service was slow and the restaurant wasn t even busy. The seats are dirty and need cleaned. Our area wasn t cleaned before we sat down and the server apologized for the dirty floor that he later swept.   We didn t order food only drinks. They serve only margaritas  but have different flavors. The  strawberry  margarita is the only drink that taste different. The  purple  is the strongest. I may return to try the food and the drinks were good.
Baby Acapulco,38,While traveling in Austin for work  we stayed near this restaurant and decided to walk over and try this place out. I m extremely picky when it comes to Mexican food.   The salsa and chips were really good and I had high hopes. That was soon diminished when I ordered food. I had fajitas with the thought that this would be a safe order. Needless to say  it wasn t. It was just meh.   My boss ordered tortilla soup and said it was meh as well.   Good place to o if you don t have a car and stay at the Embassy Suites near here.
Baby Acapulco,39,This was  unfortunately  a superbly disappointing experience. Don t get me wrong  the food was fine  and the kitchen speed was decent considering we went at 7 on a Saturday night. The service  however  was awful. Our server was friendly enough  but she was constantly forgetting about us. We asked her  and another server  a total of 4 times for silverware and still left without ever having gotten any. We were also charged for 2 sides of sour cream  yes  I know it s not expensive  even though they were only requested because they were missing from our plates. The menu mentioned specifically that sour cream is included with the nachos but  as it was missing  I requested a side of it.  I was not aware she would charge for a plating mistake . Then  when the busser took our appetizer plate  she also took the chips and salsa we were still snacking on  as well as that side of sour cream. When I mentioned the sour cream being taken  by mistake  to the server  she apologized and brought us more but charged us again. I understand a busy Saturday night  my fianc  and I have both worked in restaurants for years. But this was incredibly disappointing and not worth the price at all. We will not be returning.
Baby Acapulco,40,came for the first time for margaritas a few days ago. Atmosphere was fine  service was fine but the margs were bad. Idk if the liquor they used is just that poor of a quality or if they re using the wine based version of a margarita but it was easily the worst frozen margarita I ve ever had. Was surprised later that one of that low of quality and size was also a cool  10. I would recommend going anywhere else if you re looking to meet for a margarita  Chips and salsa were standard as well  not bad  not good
Baby Acapulco,41,I was invited to an event that was at this Baby A s location  amp  I have to say I haven t been to this location in YEARS  amp  I so have not been missing anything.  While Baby A s is not known for their food they are known for their drinks so I was disappointed that the margarita on the rocks that I ordered was very weak  amp  I was so needing a margarita that just hit the spot  -     .  I did eat but it was only guacamole  salsa   amp  queso with chip  amp  no complaints there.  The seating layout inside is very cool but wish they would put some money into remodeling  to update it some  amp  I m sure that would really help w  their business  amp  getting customers to return...atmosphere is everything.
Baby Acapulco,42,I moved away from Austin three years ago  and had a chance to come back today for a business trip. I couldn t wait to come to Baby A s for lunch.  They did not disappoint  I had my favorite chicken tortilla soup  and couldn t be happier. . Cody took great care of me in the bar area and made it a great experience as usual  I told the manager  Tim that there needs to be a Baby A s in Plano. I ll keep my fingers crossed.
Baby Acapulco,43,Sat for 15 minutes and no one ever greeted us or took our drink order. Nothing   Just got up and left  and the manager acted shocked that we were leaving but no attempt get us to stay or get any help. Don t bother 
Baby Acapulco,44,Got some rotten vegetables with my fajita plate. Moldy cheese and stale chips.   They get 1 star cuz the margarita is on point. Only need 1 to get the party started. 2 to seal the deal.   Music is Michael Jackson  BeeGee s  Al Green  etc. not to bad.
Baby Acapulco,45,This location has great spacing in terms of social distancing. I felt separated from the other diners which I appreciated. Our server  Jessica  was also very friendly  accommodating and provided excellent service. We will definitely be back 
Baby Acapulco,46,One enchilada and a cup of soup took 25 minutes to make on a to-go order when they weren t busy. I was told on the phone it would take 20 minutes  and it still wasn t ready when got there 20 minutes after the call and there were only 7 guests in the restaurant at 4 pm. The enchilada was supposed to be fajita beef with avocado sauce  which I had them verify the entire order verbally to me and what came out was ground beef with ranchero sauce. I didn t look at the food in the to-go boxes before leaving since they had verbally verified the order from the receipt  but obviously I should ve because they couldn t get a simple thing right. Not only that  but the enchilada only had meat inside  nothing else. Obviously there are supposed to be other ingredients like cheese inside as well  but there wasn t any and no cheese on top. Finally  the guy taking the order on the phone was abrupt and didn t even say anything after I said I d be there in 20 mins.  he just hung up on me.
Baby Acapulco,47,Felt like happy hour so I saw a cool looking place up near the Arbor and stop in at Baby Acapulco s. I was seated outdoors a lovely day and decided to try the Mimosa to start with the happy hour menu the small tacos. First as i waited for the drink to arrive my waiter being very friendly said he wanted to see my drivers license I thought strange obviously I am well over 21 but it is a practice to ask every senior citizen there drivers license to make sure you can drink responsibly. The tiny tacos served was pretty greasy so I decided to order the queso with chips then my Mimosa showed up and had too much of the orange juice added less alcohol  but overall good. I do recommend the queso creamy hot and delicious served with chips amazing taste. I then ordered the corn cakes very good my favorite. Waiter attentive great place to chill out for Happy hour and relax. Yes diffently will returned for dinner next time. Parking no problem and stays pretty busy being off Stonelake. Happy yelping
Baby Acapulco,48,Well  I came for the legendary purple rita and had a lot of fun grabbing drinks with a friend.  I wasn t overly impressed with their food but as I drank more of the purple rita  I ate more   They had a cheesy wedding singer type band when I came and the other times there was not a live band at all.  I m not sure which is better worse.  Baby As just isn t as good as it use to be or maybe my standards have changed since college.
Baby Acapulco,49,You come here for the drinks. Do NOT come here for the food. It is a good place to chill or bring in some out-of-towners for an app and a snifter.  They are known for there drinks  rightly so. Fairly strong and with a nice selection.  Food is more geared for apps and snacks to keep you from driving inebriated once you have the high content specialty drinks.
Baby Acapulco,50,I don t know why Baby A s has a low rating. I actually think it has good food. Now I know when you park there you can t find the entrance and I ended up entering the patio area. Seems like it was a popular place to enter since they had to put up a sign saying please check in front. I do recommend the Chicken Tortilla Soup combination which on a cold night hits to spot. Be careful it gives a good spice kick when you finish your soup. With the combination you get a taco and rice with it. Now I was tempted to get the Purple  Ritas but I was driving but my friend liked it a lot. The service was good for a Wednesday night.
Baby Acapulco,51,Went there twice while staying at the hotel nearby this week.  The first night we just had drinks and the bartender was super nice  excellent service  I wish I remembered her name.  The second night we had food  it was ok  nothing to write home about  but the service was terrible.  The server acted like she didn t want to be there and didn t want us there  forgot her name   and then we cashed out and headed to the bar and had terrible service again  forgot his name .    The margaritas are crazy strong  in our group we tried practically all of them   especially the purple  the purple is basically just tequila and everclear with no real flavor.  If are looking to get drunk for 8.95 the purple is what you want.  However  if you want a good tasting margarita  go elsewhere.    The service was so bad the second night  I likely won t be back.
Baby Acapulco,52,A Mexican place in a mall setting at about what you d expect in mid America. We were hoping that being in Austin it would have character or charm or something more but alas we were left with a mid America mall Mexican dinner.
Baby Acapulco,53,The venue is a low cieling Mexican restraunt with an indoor bar and an outdoor seating area. Parking is okay  since there is additional parking behind the place. The indoor seating is a normal Mexican restraunt setting  but with elephant pinatas everywhere   I got the pork tacos on corn  there was a subtile taste of pineapple  and it was not very flavorful or spicy at all. I find that most people will like this level of taste  but for a real foodie  it s mediocre. You can always spice it up with the salsa given for each table. The meat was well done. The portion size is for one average person.  Overall  I go here because it s close to zilker and it has air-conditioning.
Baby Acapulco,54,I ve always been here with a group of coworkers during lunch and although not spectacular  the food is good and largely dependable.  The service is great  as the waiters are polite and on top of things in terms of refilling water and chips.  However  if you re in a sizable group  8    expect a long wait for the food.  For a party of eight  the entire dining experience will take at least 1.5 hours with 45 minutes of that time waiting for entrees.  If you have that time  however  the food is rewarding.  First impressions are always important  and for Mexican restaurants  it s usually their chips.  The chips and salsa is pretty good with a good amount of spice that s not overboard.  The chips itself is very addicting and I m always guilty of satisfying any hunger I had walking in before I see my entree.  Baby A s chips are worth getting excited about.  I end up getting the Acapulco Fish Tacos most of the time.  My favorite part of this dish is the variety in the tacos.  Along with the fish there s avocado  cabbage  cilantro  and tomato  all of which tastes heavenly together.  It s mad difficult to make tilapia extremely delicious and although it can be a tad dry at times  Baby A s grills it well.  I just tried the Shrimp Enchilada today.  The enchilada is presented with two grilled shrimp on top and numerous smaller pieces of shrimp cooked inside.  Although there s a lot of shrimp inside  I wish they were a lot bigger.  Their tiny size made them dry out very easily and end up chewy.  Not so impressed.  The grilled shrimp on top  however  were pretty good.  All in all  a good standard shrimp enchilada.  I can see myself getting this again.  Never had their drinks before  but they re pretty popular with the group I go with.  If you re looking for a fun time to hang out  grab drinks  and enjoy quality Mexican food  this is a good place to go.
Baby Acapulco,55,My friend and I decided to get out and try some Mexican food. I had eaten here before and it was ok. I had a sweet waitress and ordered my favorite which was puffy tacos. The chips were warm but broken up. My puffy tacos had little meat in them but soaked in melted cheese. The tacos were stale so I told my waitress. She left my beans and small amount of rice at the table. She brought back two smaller inside portions of meat and lettuce soaked in cheese with smaller puffy tacos. I asked my friend to try the second puffy taco shell and she said it was stale. The kitchen guy came out and said he made them fresh for me. I tried to explain that they tasted the same. So that being said for  12.50 I had three bites of my black beans and a spoon full of my Mexican rice. No apologizes or offer to compliment the meal. I will not be going back to this restaurant again. There are too many Mexican places to choose from.
Baby Acapulco,56,Horrible  Horrible Horrible     I m sorry but this place needs to rethink its whole operation.  How on Cinco De Mayo does a restaurant run out of things and limit you to just one Margarita.      Which  by the way  suck    It s all Mix and not fresh.  I am really disappointed because I had many people show up and all of us had to wait for plates  tortillas and water. Each of which showed up 20 minutes after each other.  Our poor server Lady was overwhelmed and forgetful.  The food was atrocious.  Ordered fajitas for two early in the service and they still came out cold.   They only thing half way decent was the chips and salsa.   No Bueno Baby A s.  Hopefully this place will be better prepared in sept or next year around this time.  I mean Cinco De Mayo lands on the same calendar numeric day every year for eternity 
Baby Acapulco,57,For a Tex Mex chain this place is actually pretty good. They happy hour menu is what makes me a repeat customer. I m a fan of the Amores  5 tacos you get during happy hour and the drinks are pretty good too. It s pretty spot on street taco quality. Wish they are a carne asada version of this too and it will be golden. We also come by here for the chicken tortilla soup on cold days as well.   Place is huge  looks old a bit rundown but I guess that s what gives it character. The staff here is fantastic and service has always been great in every visit.
Baby Acapulco,58,Spacious Mexican restaurant- was very quiet when I went.  Food was good and service was ok.
Baby Acapulco,59,We had dinner again at this baby A s last night with our UTA student. We live in DFW area and we will always keep returning to this restaurant so long as food and service is good. Last night  our waiter was David and he was excellent  Thank you for your good service and good food  We shall return in the next month or so   PS. The margarita is tasty at this place   And the shrimp quesadilla  A must to order. Although  my son keeps raving about his burger how good it was 
Baby Acapulco,60,This was my first visit to this establishment. There is a great  festive ambiance when you walk up to the restaurant from the parking in the rear. There is a great patio with plenty of seating and warmers. Id like to sit out there next time i visit. There is also a small stage where I am assuming live music happens on certain nights. We only waited 10 minutes to be seated on a Friday night. I enjoyed all of the lights  not sure if they are always there or if it is due to Christmas. We were seated in a booth and noticed that the carpet was as old as the building  old   I am not a fan of carpet in restaurants  ever   The booths were also dated  used and abused. Needless to say  it s time for some new flooring and new booths. I ordered a swirl Margherita   blue  amp  coconut . Very good  I ve heard that this place is known for its Margherita s  amp  they didn t disappoint  The chips and salsa were really good  The salsa was not too spicy  just right for this gringa  . I wanted a good combination plate that wouldn t fill 3 plates  so the Helen platter was a nice surprise. It came with a cup of yummy chicken tortilla soup  1 chopped chicken enchilada  rice and a puffy taco. When the server brought it to the table  I was a little disgusted by all of the sweat all over his face. It was gross     If I would ve seen any of that sweat drip  it would ve been all over    So we blessed the food  I  topped it all with salsa and Queso and dug in. . I loved the soup. Not overly impressed with the enchilada but the taco was ok.  Overall  it was an OK experience. 3 stars due to the carpet  booths  and sweaty server  I would go back for the patio  Happy Hour  Margherita s  appetizers  chips and salsa  and possibly live music.
Baby Acapulco,61,Came here for my first yelp event     Yah   and i had such a great time  We went during happy hour  Mon-Fri 2-7  and they have a food menu with items that are only  5 . I got the street tacos and man were they delicious. The carnitas were cooked perfectly and the corn tortillas hit the spot. I really do wish I got our servers name because he was great  attentive to our drinks and cleaning the table when needed and we had about 8 people in our party. So let s get into their salsa yummmmm I mean the right amount of heat. I don t have anything bad to say about my experience. But I will tell you the famous purple Rita is defiantly strong they knew what they were doing when they put a 2 per limit on it. Keep up the great work  
Baby Acapulco,62,Curb side purples please      Really the line would wrap around the block stay safe and we can come visit soon.
Baby Acapulco,63,The place looks nice.  And  the food was alright. I had the fajitas. I asked for floor tortillas and only received two initially.  Then it was hard to get extra tortillas.  But  I was in town visiting due to business   and many people at the hotel  and the waiter s were bragging on the purple margaritas. So  me and a few of my colleagues ordered it.  Bad taste.
Baby Acapulco,64,Tried to support Baby A s at this  difficult time...we are regulars. The food was cold  not packed well in the bag.  They lied and said that they were not allowed to sell margaritas. We checked later and found other restaurants are in fact selling margaritas to go. So disappointed...won t be back for a long time
Baby Acapulco,65,Went in for a family dinner  Alyssa was great  Not only was it great service but she was patient with my kids. I will definitely be back and will be asking for her  What a great experience   thanks for Making a great dinner tonight 
Baby Acapulco,66,Very disappointed. We have gone to Baby A s for a little over a year now  amp  the last visit here will probably be the last one. My boyfriend has always gotten a military discount on his food only  but this visit he was told he couldn t get it since he wasn t in uniform. He showed him his military id  amp  was still told  the Id would not work  amp  he has to be active  amp  in uniform. We were then told the policy had change within the last three weeks.  I do want to point out that we were there about a week ago  amp  he was able to get the military discount. If the policy is going to change  post a notice on the door  amp  make sure everyone on the team is on the same page  amp  aware of the change.
Baby Acapulco,67,Tried to eat there Tuesday  seated  but then NEVER even got water  chips or knew who was  supposed  to be our wait person    Service has gotten worse and worse over the last year...will NOT be back there....
Baby Acapulco,68,Update 6 months later  loved the tacos al pastor with the beans  could do without the rice  Service was slow for a Sunday  Jordan seemed lost  And the margaritas are still good as ever  Brought my partner here for the 1st time and he really enjoyed everything   I ll be back in the summer   FYI  I was at the Cheesecake Factory and the tacos there were average  if you want good tacos with plenty of meat come here instead and drinks are half the price of that other place 
Baby Acapulco,69,Place is devoted like a tiki bar.  Except for the fact that you are in Austin where the temps are over 100 and the location is an office park.    The portions are Texas sized.  A bit too salty for my taste.  I ordered fish tacos. I ended up eating  he fish but didn t eat the rest of the meal.  Maybe it was because it was 100 degrees outside.    The service was a little slow and I went in around 1230 pm  the place looked empty.    If I come back to Austin I may try this place again to see if my experience was a one time  thing or a consistency with this place.
Baby Acapulco,70,Despite reviews that I read before visiting this restaurant for the first time  the experience overall was quite nice  The food was tasty and prices reasonably. I had the Sarita combo and queso compuesta. The enchilada wasn t my favorite but the puffy taco was very good. Our waitress consistently checked on us and our beverage glasses were never empty. I would recommend trying this place out.   
Baby Acapulco,71,Best tortilla soup I ve tried  It was so delicious plus my waiter made the whole experience 10 times better  Teo was very attentive and even after a small problem  he ensured to to fix it in a timely manner. Definitely recommend 
Baby Acapulco,72,Service was great  Adan did a great job  The service was quick and efficient. The food was delicious and the staff was very accommodating 
Baby Acapulco,73,We love eating at Baby A s Stonelake  and want to call out outstanding service by Mimi. Mimi is awesome  remembering our favorite drinks and dishes  making sure we have everything we need  and generally making us feel taken care of. She s the best 
Baby Acapulco,74,We went to Baby A s for my birthday dinner this week and had such a wonderful time   One of the nicest things about our visit was our server Jessica.  She was so personable and accommodating  and she cheerfully attended all of our needs -- friendly  but not intrusive.  I think Baby A s needs to give her a Christmas bonus 
Baby Acapulco,75,These guys are so great  I love this team  the location  and of course the building  The purple margaritas are fun  and the food is decent. They have a lot of room  and make it fun with music at times.  Say hi to Ricky when you come in 
Baby Acapulco,76,Food was blah  ritas didnt taste like fresh squeezed lime juice nor good quality tequila. My chile relleno was not freshly made- may have been microwaved. I asked to have salad instead beans  and got shredded iceburg lettuce. I did like their rice. Would not go back here. If craving fresh made tex mex and ritas go to Chuy s  Lupe or one if the reputable ones. I think this is more for those who want to get sloshed  drinks were strong . Knocked down another point for damaged clothing and nasal passages. Then bathroom reaked of bleach fumes and then got bleach stains all over dark new pants from side of sink.
Baby Acapulco,77,I went to baby A s today to meet a coworker for an early dinner. The restaurant was almost empty while we were there  but the service was great. Our server Alyssa recommended the stuffed avocado and it was delicious she was great and the bartender Joseph was very nice. We love this Baby A s location.
Baby Acapulco,78,Our waitress was very polite  friendly and attentive just enough. My tongue needed its own personal fan as the salsa was spicy but very flavorful. The chips were great. Best salsa in town. The beef enchiladas with cheddar cheese was very good. The chicken tortilla soup is world famous. The puffy taco was excellent.
Baby Acapulco,79,This is our favorite location primarily because of our FAVORITE server... Sherri  She is so attentive which is hard to come by now a days  and not to mention she never fails to keep us laughing and having a great time throughout our night  The purple margs are obvi our fave  but the queso compuesto is bomb and the tortilla soup gives me life. Although we are equal distance to the Baby A s location in pflugerville  we always choose the Stonelake location because we know we ll see our favorite girl Sherri  Keep it up Baby A s Stonelake 
Baby Acapulco,80,When you receive a basket of bottom of the bag chips with your queso order  mostly no bigger than a quarter  you know you re at a restaurant that doesn t care about their food. Sadly  the rest of the meal was no better. The chicken in the puffy tacos was soggy and bland. Really  the only reason I see to ever come here is if you want to get drunk off their strong purple margaritas and listen to live music on the patio. Skip the food.
Baby Acapulco,81,Love Baby A s food  no matter what I get I m always satisfied with the savory flavors and the decent portions they provide. Today was no different as we all enjoyed sitting and eating some good food. The staff was pleasant and willing to answer any questions we had about the food. Overall  pleasant experience.
Baby Acapulco,82,I really enjoyed my experience here  The food was so yummy and our server Jessica was so nice and fun  she had us laughing almost the whole time we were there. Will definitely be back  
Baby Acapulco,83,We regularly visit Baby A s. Sergio always takes care of us. He goes above and beyond to make sure everything is correct and we are happy. I can t say enough great things about him  If you are ever there  ask for Sergio 
Baby Acapulco,84,This place....I just can t even. Service was alright... My friend order the  Triple Stack  quesadilla  which just means there is an extra tortilla in the middle. That thing was 10.00 and the saddest thing I have ever seen. I could go to taco cabana and get a personal one that is the EXACT SAME SIZE  cheaper and a thousand times better. The photo I am posting is my baby changa which cost the same as his sad quesadilla. My baby changa was good  but seeing my friend get completely screwed over for his meal is just unacceptable.   Do yourself a solid and just don t go there. I feel like they are charging way too much for something my 6 year old niece could do a better job at making 
Baby Acapulco,85,Purple Margarita  That s it. Enough said. I will keep typing because I have to. Chicken Tortilla Soup 
Baby Acapulco,86,Food  GREAT. Drinks  Strong. SERVICE  TERRIBLE. My family and I were here for a family reunion and had a party of 28. Upon entrance into the establishment the attitude of all service workers we encountered was very poor. Our main server Madison barely made any eye contact and said less than the minimum words that should be exchanged in the conversation of placing an order. I will say that she was on her own the large majority of the time we we there while several other workers were standing around doing nothing. That influenced the poor flow of the refill of drinks  chips and salsa  and the 30 mintues between drink and food orders. The manager came around to help her out a little bit and when I let her know that after 3 sips of my drink it was too strong and that I didnt want it anymore she told me that they dont allow drink returns and that she could bring me out some strawberry puree. Why would I pay money to make my own drink or drink something that was poorly made  Nothing of greeting was said to us upon arrival or departure. I did not feel valued as a customer here at all  I will not be returning.
Baby Acapulco,87,Where s the door  I parked in the back and couldn t find the right door. It was like a maze. Once we finally made it inside  we were seated immediately. Come to find out....Baby As sells margarita flights  This is such a great idea. There margaritas are strong as usual.... So strong. They will definitely knock you off your rocker if you aren t paying attention. The only downfall of the flight is that you can t mix and match the flavors you want. There was a game on the TV and a large crowd screaming at the game. I was not expecting this in a restaurant setting. It was almost as rowdy as a sports bar. It was a little off putting for a restaurant. We were looking for a place to eat and have a conversation with our meal  but it was a little loud for that. The service was a little slow even though there wasn t a full restaurant  but our waiter was very attentive the few times he came by. It was nice visiting a new location for this great restaurant.
Baby Acapulco,88,We are normally and super fans of Baby Acapulco  but today was not the best performance on their part.  Service was slow in we were left waiting for about 10 minutes to ask for a more corn tortillas.  By the time the waitress came bag with the corn tortillas  the fajitas were cold.  They were very busy today as it was cinco de Mayo but I feel like it would  have made more sense to have brought more than 2 corn tortillas from the start for the large fajita plate that we ordered.  Between the 2 adults in our party  we ordered 4 regular Margaritas.  When we inspected our bill we realized that they had charged us for 4 premium Margaritas.  We call their attention to this error and it took a while to fix it. We were dining with children and the children were beginning to lose their composure at the end of the meal which is why we decided it was time to leave. By the time they actually got our bill fixed  the kids were really losing it and it just made for a negative experience.  Also  instead of fixing the price for each Margarita they just took one Margarita off which means that we still were not made whole for their mistake and they ended up keeping some of our money.  If you make a mistake  you need to make the customer whole and not just arbitrarily decide that you are going to do whatever is convenient for you  amp  keep their money. NOT OK 
Baby Acapulco,89,Hosted an event here for work and the staff was amazing    Chris was our server and he made every effort to make sure we had everything we needed. The manager James was also very accommodating and made sure my event went smooth. Even the security officer helped when we were having technical issues with the presentation    Will definitely keep this on my list of venue locations for Austin work events 
Baby Acapulco,90,Love this place  We had a 45 minute wait  amp  the manager James was SO helpful. Him  amp  hostess waitress Mayra worked it out so that we could get seated earlier  amp  gave us the most incredible service. Mayra was WONDERFUL  amp  so sweet  
Baby Acapulco,91,Omar was an amazing server  He was always checking on us and providing great service  10 10 recommend the purple marg without a doubt 
Baby Acapulco,92,Bobby and Ricky  bartenders  they are Both the best . Always helpful  and both really Laid back. They both always make our experience here a great one.   Keep up the awesome customers services guys.
Baby Acapulco,93,We finally got a baby sitter and parents night out could not have been better   Atmosphere like this and people like  Jordan make this a choice location to spend you parent time out . The food is great but the fun times were what we came for thank you jordon  
Baby Acapulco,94,This is Our go to spot when we want Mexican food in austin.  The service and food always meet our expectations.  Love is some baby a s.
Baby Acapulco,95,The food was amazing drinks where amazing. Our waitress Francis I believe her name was was outstanding  Another waitress who did amazing was Jessica I love going here the vibes you get right when you walk in are awesome. Definitely will be back 
Baby Acapulco,96,My family and I went yesterday.  And was treated so bad.  The waitress was so unprofessional and rude   she snatched the menus out of my hand and then made a jester of cutting her throat behind my back in front of my mother  son  amp  daughter in law.  This was our go to place to eat with the family.  Now I will not step foot back in this place.  We left without even eating because after her jester we decided it was best
Baby Acapulco,97,Great job Keona A.  My second time here. Ref check  273 table  D32... Great service  amp  great food   These days it s either one or the other...rarely both   BabyAs nailed it  Yep  my family will be back    Ask for Keona 
Baby Acapulco,98,I absolutely love this place and our server Mimi was so amazing and so attentive to our table  She stayed smiling the whole night  It was such a great experience to have such positive energy around amazing food and drinks  Thanks Mimi 
Baby Acapulco,99,I have always been a huge fan of Baby A s. Haven t been in a while and I was SO GLAD that i decided to come back on Cinco de Mayo...  They had a cover band playing pop and rock hits from 80s  90s  and today which was really fun  especially after the purp rita kicked in .  Food and service was great..  Did I mention I LOVE their purple ritas  Seriously 1 and 1 2 and you are GOOD   HAHA it s so amazing 
Baby Acapulco,100,Visited for my 3rd time and had a new server greet me  Her name is Mimi...shes was great fast short but sweet with everything. I was surprised at the options we have with ordering food and drink suggestions  Thank you so much Mimi for making our experience better than our previous.
Baby Acapulco,101,Adan was amazing friendly and actually looked through the menus with me and my boyfriend to help find what we would enjoy. If you are ever at this location you should always request for him  you won t be disappointed.
Baby Acapulco,102,Keona was just fantastic  amazing service  friendly personality and just the best and more than I could expect on such a busy night.   We came on Cinco De Mayo and our waitress was the life saver of a potential bad night. I will come back and can only hope to have the same great service    
Baby Acapulco,103,I cant leave zero stars so I guess I liked the live music. I sat for 10 minutes wuthout being served so I walked into the bar and got a drink. Back to my table  still no service aaked for a manager then it took another 10 min. To get a rude little girl with attitude. My friend got a frozen that tasted rancid  so asked for a different flavor also rancid tasting as if the mix had gone bad or a mouse was dead in the machine. We ended up drinking water watching the band due to lousy drinks and service. I have never been so let down by any Baby A s and I have been to the all. Dont waste your time or money  and dont be as nice as I was instead just walk away.
Baby Acapulco,104,Our server Cody worked a large table tonight and made it happen  Drinks were on point and on time. Thanks for the service tonight Cody 
Baby Acapulco,105,I was in Austin for the weekend and a friend recommended Baby A s. My time was kinda limited so I placed an order to go. When I arrived I met with Alyssa one of the servers. She advised me that my order would still be a few minutes. She was very nice and offered me something to drink while I waited. The restaurant was a nice place and Alyssa was very nice respectful. I will definitely be coming back to Baby A s   
Baby Acapulco,106,Sometimes you just need a good kinda dumpy place to drink at that you can go to on the regular.  Baby A s is it for me... and mainly because of their bartender  Eddie.  The place isn t the best venue... but on the weekends  they have live music... and you basically can t mess up warm chips and queso.... you just can t... well I bet you can  but they don t.  I treat this like my local bar... and mainly because Eddie s just a cool guy to hang out with there.  He can make anything... if you re drinking anything outside of the purple frozen drink which you can only get 2 of... because it ll getcha drunk quick....  I ll be honest with you  the menu isn t all that thrilling... I haven t had anything off of it other than apps.  It s mexican food at it s most basic... but if you want a quick meal  or a cool place to just kinda hang out at... or a great place to embarrass someone with terrible singing on their birthday at... Baby A s is your spot.  I m not wowed  but I m also not gonna stop going on the weekends... it s just a calm  decent place to chill..  3.5 stars... but I ll round up to 4.
Baby Acapulco,107,Hmmm--I m not understanding the poor Yelp reviews. We went on a Friday afternoon around 5 30. They have a nice outdoor patio and an indoor patio with a nice fire pit. Because it was rainy  we sat inside at a booth. We were surprised at how large the restaurant is  Lots of booths and it s cozy inside. They have a page of their menu just dedicated to their various margaritas. I m not a flavored margarita fan  so asked about just a regular margarita  which the waiter said is the lime flavored margarita. It was  5 on happy hour  and a good strength but tasted too lime-y for me.  My husband got the premium margarita   8  which was not on happy hour  but it the glass was FULL of ice  which was really ridiculous.  My husband ordered the big bowl of tortilla soup which he loved  and I ordered the Pollo Tropical plate. Very good and healthy  I liked the warm chips and salsa  they are thicker chips and I prefer thin  but there were still good . I was pleasantly surprised at the prices and portions. Most entrees are around  10. We will definitely be back and look forward to the patio in the spring months 
Baby Acapulco,108,The food is pretty good  and the service is great. I have been a handful of times w  my uncle and have had a pretty positive experiences.  The last time I was there though  the employee tried to argue with me about my Service Dog. He told me he was going to talk to the manager  and I said fine. I am glad he talked to his manager  because he was set straight. Not his fault  but I am glad that he had the good sense to double check. In the future  please verse your employees a little better on service dog laws  otherwise I had a relatively pleasant experience.
Baby Acapulco,109,We hosted a party there recently and the food was delicious. The drinks were really strong  but in a good way. We were able to reserve the back room  which is a nice round area with plenty of seating. Our waiter  Sergio  took care of about 35 people and did it with ease. Whatever we needed  he was on it  We were able to send over our orders ahead of time  so when we got there  the food came out promptly. Baby A s and their entire team deserves kudos for their great food and awesome staff 
Baby Acapulco,110,Food was OK  service was OK. Not the place it used to be. The only truly bad thing was they have street corn on the menu. Rather than have a fresh piece of corn that is grilled and well seasoned  which is what Mexican street corn is   they start with a piece of frozen corn  boil it so it is nice and mushy  add some mayonnaise and a sprinkle seasoning to create a truly unappetizing  inedible product.  In the summertime  the cost of corn is incredibly cheap. The idea of getting fresh grilled corn sounds awesome. Getting the mush is pretty disappointing. I told the manager about it  he said he couldn t do anything about it but it would he would pass the information on. I didn t get the feeling he would.
Baby Acapulco,111,I haven t been here in years but after a doctors appt I figured I would stop in and grab a bite to let traffic die down before driving home. Hostess sat me in a nice corner with a window since I was alone.....Big shout out to Krystal for her recommendation on the soup and tacos. She even asked me for my preference on the protein I wanted. I ve never had a waiter waitress so quick on their feet  even my sweet tea stayed full 
Baby Acapulco,112,Mannnnn Krystal is THE BOMB  Hands down  The best server I ve ever encountered. Make sure when you come to ask for KRYSTAL 
Baby Acapulco,113,Food was decent  however it was  300 to cater for 15 people   20 per person .  Order was to be picked up at 11 45am and it was not ready until 12 00.  This was for a business luncheon so I was on a schedule.  Arrived to the office with lunch and although they gave us forks  we did not receive plates or any utensils to serve the food from the containers.  Would not recommend for catering services  expected a little more for the money paid.
Baby Acapulco,114,I came in with a party of six and told I was in a bit of a rush  and I let that host know she told me it would be a 45 minute wait  yikes  Normally this would be a reasonable  time but as I said I was in a time crunch. Well to my delight another host named Alyssa  went above and beyond and was able to accommodate my party in about 10 minutes  Talk about a life saver  it s small things like this that make the difference. I just wanted to commend and thank Alyssa for her awesome and prompt service. I will definitely be returning 
Baby Acapulco,115,They have 30.06 and 30.07 sign s .  They ve lost my business and apparently others as well. Went in on a Saturday night around 8 30ish with some friends from Dallas and the place was dead. Not sure what happened this place used to be poppin  but I won t be going back.
Baby Acapulco,116,This was the second time I had been to Austin  from Florida  and the first time I had Baby Acapulco was closer to downtown area so it was a bit crazier. I thought I d check out a different one and this is where we ended up. I was on a business trip a couple weeks ago before the new year and wanted to take my coworker and he LOVED it  We had fajitas  enchiladas and some of their margaritas. Man  such good Mexican food and drinks  Our server was a sweet young lady named Maria  I believe  and she was a great server  never had to ask for anything she brought us anything we needed before our meal came out and welcomed us to Austin with great hospitality and recommend some things we could do on our spare time  again very sweet young lady. The restaurant was much cleaner and nicer looking than the other location. I will continue to come to this location when I am working in the Austin area.
Baby Acapulco,117,Tuesday night dinner after arriving in town later in the evening for a business trip.  I mainly picked this place because it was convenient to my hotel.  I had the chile relleno stuffed with beef.  Beans and rice as sides were kinda bland and not very satisfying.  The main dish was good and cooked properly.  Chips and salsa were avg  salsa was a bit hot for my taste  and I typically like hot things.  Almost to the point of them needing a  mild  option  but maybe that s just what you get in TX     Long story short - I wouldn t go out of my way to eat here  but the server was nice and the meal was presented quickly  on a plate that was about 200F... .
Baby Acapulco,118,Raiza was amazing  She handled our 10  person table with separate checks and a lot of chaos. She was friendly  professional  prompt and courteous. Thank you so much   
Baby Acapulco,119,They decided to run my credit card for more than I signed for  and the service at the bar was terrible  and the restaurant wasn t busy.  I was visiting Austin and heard good things so stopped by with a coworker.  Service at the bar was terrible.  I kept having to ask one of the regulars to flag down the bartender because they were completely ignoring us.  I always tip well  but apparently didn t tip enough because the charge to my card is more than the bill with tip  and I have pictures.  I tried calling the store directly  but got no answer so I emailed the restaurant with the email address listed on the website.  Waiting to hear back.
Baby Acapulco,120,This is our favorite resturaunt for mexican food AND holding our family birthday parties at.  We just ate again yesterday and one of our favorite waitresses was there.  Her name is Raiza.  She is an awesome waitress and always keeps us loaded with chips and hot sauce without having to ask.  You will not be disappointed with Baby A s    
Baby Acapulco,121,Not a relaxing place.To much drama just to get a damn drink. They worry more about watching over your back  like having your mother with you  instead of worrying about the quality of their food and personnel. Make it a bar or a restaurant can t handle both.
Baby Acapulco,122,BEST PLACE EVER     My girls nd I have been coming here since they opened and it JUST GETS BETTER    It is pretty awesome when u are a regular and the server  bar tender KNOWS UR DRINK    Well  RICK in the bar is for SURE to treat u JUST LIKE THAT    He gets EVERYTHING right    And to satisfy a table of middle aged women to the level that Rick does  not an easy task  but he does EVERY TIME    TWO THUMBS UP FOR BABY S AND 3 AND 1 2 IF RICK IS UR SERVER   
Baby Acapulco,123,Baby A s in two words  Purple Margarita.  Drink your limit of two and everything else is great and fun from there.  My favorites here are the Baby A s Soup  Green Chile Burger  and Puffy Tacos.  Of course  the chips and salsa are always great to start with the Purples.  I see a great deal of negativity in reviews  but if you come here with managed expectations  everything is fine.  Don t expect world-class dining  but do expect good  reliable Tex-Mex at a reasonable price.  The service has always been great  friendly and attentive for me.  To top it off  Baby A s features some great local talent in their live music lineup 
Baby Acapulco,124,Unimpressive.  10 for 6 nachos and  13 for a pathetic serving of shrimp enchiladas. Eh. Go spend your money somewhere else. For subpar texmex in small servings  this is the place to beat. Otherwise  don t waste your time.
Baby Acapulco,125,Hosted a Meet and Greet for Texas Sport Bike Riders. We rented a patio and received spectacular service from Jordan and Liz Beth  Decent food  great space  amazing service  I highly recommend if you re having a gathering.
Baby Acapulco,126,Bummer. Wish I would have checked the reviews first. I stopped here because it was the closest restaurant to my hotel and it looked nice from the outside  star 1 and 2 . When I approached the stand the host said   what do you need    I responded   a seat  maybe  .   Apparently he expected that answer because with menu in hand he walked away. I assumed  right this way sir  must have been implied so trailing the unhostly host I was pleased I wasn t following him to his smoke break and was seated at a booth in a very uncrowded restaurant.  Chips salsa and water were delivered as expected. I then saw the host deliver a basket of chips to a table after he took a chip off the top and ate it during the delivery.  I was already halfway through my basket so I figured whatever. Chips and salsa were not bad but I didn t give it a star because I doubt they were homemade.  My waitress arrived and I ordered the fried fish tacos with cilantro rice and black beans. The tacos arrived in about 10 minutes. After examining for bite marks  I did the taco head tilt and tried one. Very bland even with the side sauce.  Beans were not bad.  Chips and salsa were the best part of this meal. My glass of water remained empty as my waitress and the unhost served the other 10 patrons.  I don t know how long they have been in business but I will be surprised if it is much longer. Too many really good restaurants around. There is  10 I wish I would have spent at Subway.  Don t mean to be so negative  I really tried to find something redeeming.  Enjoy 
Baby Acapulco,127,My wife  Melissa and I love the puffy tacos at Baby A s and lately that has meant trips to this stonelake location.  Always so very good...  Nicely spiced  great Charro beans  tasty rice and lots of chips and salsa too to bring out those flavors even better.  We just returned from our latest visit a few minutes ago and this time was even better than usual-our waiter  we asked his name and it was Sergio  was friendly  accommodating  did not hover but seemed to know when the salsa was running low and served up those puffy  beefy wonderful tacos hot and ready to eat...  He made our trip even better than usual.  I already had a picture of an earlier serving as the background on my phone but if I didn t  I would have done it today.  Thanks  Sergio...   Emil  amp  Melissa Balusek
Baby Acapulco,128,Amazing  Our server David R was so kind and took excellent care of us  best frozen margarita I ve ever had 
Baby Acapulco,129,Its unfortunate that Austin is under a boil water band  but when this place uses the situation to gauge the customer on  2.35 for every soft drink and a  1 for all water.  Come on now... It would great if they only charged you once  which would make more sense...
Baby Acapulco,130,Baby A gets a bad rap but it s actually a great place to meet for lunch or hh.  They do the normal Tex-Mex stuff well   Burritos  enchiladas  tacos  fajitas  and margaritas.  Don t go there for a white glove experience...you go for hh 4-7  especially if there is one right by your office .  The tortilla soup is one of my faves.
Baby Acapulco,131,Food was good. Drinks I hear are strong. Bitcoin meetup is here so that s a good thing.
Baby Acapulco,132,Attempted to order a to go order over the phone and the host made it very difficult ... can t believe they will turn away business on to go orders over the phone... it s about speed and you make me come in to order to go and sit here and wait  Maybe the manager should re-evaluate their policy on to go orders. Okay well I will never order here again and suggest you don t either    
Baby Acapulco,133,Our server was named Jesus and he was great     He served us all night delicious margaritas and kept checking on us constantly to give us more French fries. He is the best     
Baby Acapulco,134,There are many reasons to come to this Baby A s. But the first and greatest of all  are the bartenders  Ricky and Diego. They are consistently some of the most on point and fun people to be around - especially when they re together. I come just for them. On the other hand  if you like GREAT frozen margaritas  warm chips and good salsa  and fantastic al pastor. Come to this Baby A s.
Baby Acapulco,135,If I could give this place a zero  I would. We decided to sit inside because there was live music and we thought it would be too loud for the baby so they seated us in the restaurant. We only went to drink and grab dessert and thank goodness for that. We didn t have anyone come up to the table for at least 10 minutes after being seated and never got chips and salsa or water. After getting our own drinks from the bar  we finally had three different servers come up to the table because no one knew who was suppose to be assigned to us. We ordered one drink from the first server and she never returned to our table. After probably 20 minutes  the manager approached our table and asked if we had been helped. I said we had had a few different people but all we were really going to be was drink and she became super crappy and said we should have requested to be in the bar...with the baby. We said we wanted to be in the restaurant side and she proceeded to say that it  wasn t their custom  to have people just drinking in the restaurant and stared at for a minute before grabbing up all but one menu and walking away. Another waiter came back to our table and asked if he could bring us chips and salsa or anything else and then apologized for our service. When he turned to walk away  the manager was waiting for him and chatted with him and he never returned to our table after that. Had we been planning to eat  the entire experience would have ruined that...like it did about us ordering our dessert  which we chose to get elsewhere after leaving. Super disappointed since it looked like it could be a great place but I guess next time we will look further out from our hotel. Thanks to the guy that actually did try to help us out  we appreciate it.
Baby Acapulco,136,We went on a Friday for happy hour and did NOT have a favorable experience. We spoke to the GM  Ron  about it and he gave us his card and invited us to come back.  We did and had a great experience the second time around. Service was excellent  food was excellent  And we noticed that other tables were getting ready same outstanding service as we were.. so it want just because Rob told them to take care of us. We ll go back again. Thank you to Ron and the Baby A s staff for making an effort to win us back.
Baby Acapulco,137,Y all.....MARINA is freaking AWESOME. She was very friendly and was honest about the menu. She offered fantastic suggestions. I had the fried fish tacos and they were bomb. The Blue margarita was lit. Go to her now 
Baby Acapulco,138,Excellent service our server Alyssa was amazing very fast and kept our glasses filled. Definitely going back  
Baby Acapulco,139,Worst establishment I ve ever been to.  Very bad service. Run down.  The sign off the road is falling apart. Doesn t seem like they even clean the place.  Management team  you ve failed horribly.  Do not come here. This place will not last much longer.
Baby Acapulco,140,I stop coming to this Location because they changed the bartenders. But today they had NANCY and SERFINA and they know their trait and I miss them I never have to wait for anyone and their attitudes are always POSITIVE       Thank you keep that team   
Baby Acapulco,141,I order Baby A s tortilla soup from Favor several times a month  amp  Baby A s  always gets my order right  amp  they are fast  Yummy food- good service.
Baby Acapulco,142,Nope.   Bad service  dirty place.  Food  mediocre  faster than draft beers ordered.   For a city celebrated for so much including its cuisine I would not recommend and would in fact urge you to go elsewhere. Like Taco Bell. At least it s cheap fast  amp  you know exactly what you re getting.
Baby Acapulco,143,I haven t been to this location in about a year but today s visit was above-average. As a matter of fact it was an excellent visit. Our waitress Destiny was the best    Prompt and friendly and the chips and queso were on point  I will be returning soon 
Baby Acapulco,144,If this place steadily improved for a decade or so it could eventually get to two stars.    It s my fault for going here.   Everyone in Austin knows Baby As is terrible.   But we were headed back from a game and the kids were starving and we thought what the hell- at least it will be quick.  Well we were wrong about that most of all.    I won t go into detail but there are a bunch of small things that are easy for a restaurant to get right that place can t get right.  We never got our apps  the drinks weren t right  the food order was wrong  and the check took forever.
Baby Acapulco,145,Not a complaint at against Baby A s in general just the location in the Arburetum  Let me say this particular location is absolutely horrible  if you sit at the bar and have to deal with their bartenders for food and drinks. Sat at the bar and tried to get a drink - took 15 minutes of actual begging and pleading to even get an acknowledgement from 2 bartenders though the place was dead on a Thursday night   First time at this newer location but been to the location on Barton Springs and prior location at I-35 and 290 at least 100 times in last decade  never a problem.  AVOID THIS LOCATION at all costs  
Baby Acapulco,146,After calling a couple of places that had long waits  my girlfriend and I decided to come here. Our server  Scotty  caught us as we were walking into the building and promptly seated us. The outdoor seating area is nice  and live music was in full swing. Complementary chips and salsa are great  the queso was decent  and the drinks were strong. Scotty was excellent until a large party showed up  and even then he was good. The entrees were the only part of the experience that didn t tickle my fancy. The tortilla soup was nice and spicy  but there was a huge hunk of chicken in it that needed to be shredded. The enchilada with verde sauce was lot better than the puffy taco  a mini taco salad of sorts . The rice was a bit bland. Overall it was a good dining experience for a lazy  warm Saturday night.
Baby Acapulco,147,Keona is the best server ever      She was very fast with our food and attentive. Te food was great and I recommend the queso compuesto. Love the old 80 s music while sitting at the table. Plenty of tv s to watch all the sports you want. Highly recommend for lunch and dinner     
Baby Acapulco,148,I go into Baby A s at Stone Lake as often as I can. I will only sit at the bar when Joseph the bartender is working because he is awesome. He gives great customer service in the bar and it is always a good time when he is there.
Baby Acapulco,149,Two things to order here   the purple margs and the pork al pastor with charro beans.  Do NOT stray from this and you will leave moderately giggly and sated.    Hubby and his friend both got the  Famous Wet Burritos .  That just sounds nasty.  There are only a few things I would eat that are described as  wet   and this ain t one of em.  Why would you want a soggy burrito   The  wet  just means they cover em in a sauce of your choosing and hubby s actually was not bad covered in queso  but that thing musta packed about 6694 calories.      The pastor here is usually pretty good.  Little chunks of seasoned pork and pineapple sauteed     together  with cilantro and purple onion on the side and served with a nice and tangy avocado sauce.  The charros are really good  chock loaded with tomato  onion and bacon.  This is my go-to meal when forced to eat at Baby A s.  The purples    Well they make me warm and fuzzy in all the right places. They make me dance across the parking lot.  They make me kiss and say  I love you man  to my hubby s best friend as we left. They make me sing  Baby Got Back  at the top of my lungs in my car.  Charro beans and rice din t miss me  
Baby Acapulco,150,Bathrooms are atrocious   Won t return to this location unless they address these issues.  One stall was out of service.  The other two were full.  The one I used had no toilet paper holder and the only available paper was in the floor between this stall and the one that is out of order.  Does this mean the toilet paper had seen the overflow that caused the  out of order  designation  Not sure.  They were out of toilet seat covers and the trash can was overflowing.  All this  during happy hour  not even the dinner rush.  A waitress did ask what I was taking pictures of and said it didn t like good for the middle of a shift. I agreed it didn t look good at the end of a shift.  She said she would tell the management.  Not comforting for a grown woman out to happy hour forced to choose between using questionable toilet paper or dripping dry.  You guess which I chose.
Baby Acapulco,151,Marcos was amazing  Great customer service and had a smile the entire time  Did not a Have to ask for anything  he was 100  on top of everything      Thank you Marcos   
Baby Acapulco,152,First time here with a co-worker.  Tried the purple Rita everybody bragged about. Only had one and let s say I didn t need another. Very good. My shrimp enchiladas were also on point. I ll be back. Highly recommend.
Baby Acapulco,153,On a Friday night  with great weather for being outside  when half of the tables in the Gazebo were open  they could not seat us. Still didn t understand why. The hostess needed to check with 5 people before she could give an estimate  inaccurate  by which we could be seated.
Baby Acapulco,154,Best Margarita s in town. Great appetizers  rest of the menu is pretty good. Service is usually really good.
Baby Acapulco,155,Just wanted to give a thanks to RON And his wonderful staff here at baby A s For making us feel really welcome And also providing great customer service.  We love this location. The purple margarita  Is one of our favorite drinks here Highly recommend it. We also love sitting outside on the patio Enjoyin Austin s beautiful weather there s also really big trees  With lots of shade.
Baby Acapulco,156,Great place to hang out with the family. Relaxing atmosphere  great people and our server Ms. Carolyn was on top of her game. The purple margaritas are as good as they say  SORRY. I hit wrong Baby A s location. I was at S. Lake shore in South Austin  Riverside. I m certain the food at this Baby A s is just as delicious.
Baby Acapulco,157,I m a huge fan of baby A s in general as they make my favorite frozen margarita in town  but this location is especially wonderful for multiple reasons. First off  the location is unbeatably accessible and also has one of the cutest outdoor patios in the area. ...But the real treasure here is Bobby  who was my waiter tonight  and mentioned that he also bartends. He was transparently informative about the happy hour specials  his recommendations  and was truly committed to ensuring that I was always pleased with my order. I must admit that I was having a rough week and came in for a margarita with a girlfriend  but Bobby s kindness and sincerity actually turned my day around  which doesn t happen much these days. I would definitely appreciate more individuals like Bobby in the service industry.  Stop by if you re in the area 
Baby Acapulco,158,We go here for the 2 P s. The patio and the purple   This place is like the  Oasis  you don t go there for the quality of the food  but simply because you want to be in the atmosphere.... The patio is great with the live music on the weekends. Nothing in Austin and beat a purple margarita to start our your weekend.
Baby Acapulco,159,Minus a star because the food isn t as good as the Pflugerville Baby As. The drinks however are always good. Service was also great  always is when we come to this one.. I thinks the service is a little better than the other one. This one doesn t have as nice of a bar but does it s job right 
Baby Acapulco,160,Baby As is a great place for a relaxing lunch. It was decorated beautifully for Christmas. My 3 year old twins loved the blow up Santa and hot chocolate. The tree and lights were so pretty. We got many cute pics  Sheree  our waitress  was very attentive. The boys were begging for queso from the moment we sat down. Sheree made a joke about getting it out quickly for them and boy did she. My mom and I had a margarita. They were strong  Just how we like them. The lunch portions were perfect. I recommend the puffy tacos and cheese enchiladas. We can t wait to go back for a relaxing lunch sometime again soon.
Baby Acapulco,161,Not the food. Definitely not the food. I came to have drinks and listen to Joe King Carrasco Play live. Yep  I had some chips and salsa  bean  amp  cheese nachos  but that s it. This place needs help in the menu department. Any restaurant can sell beer and  meh  margaritas.  That is all.
Baby Acapulco,162,The food was okay  the service  Susan   sucked. Was very rude and unprofessional  she treated us like 3rd class citizens. Her attitude changed when she noticed my louis Vuitton wallet...... I still left her a more than average tip. Will never go back
Baby Acapulco,163,Horrible service  Thanks for forgetting to bring the food  Once we were FINALLY waited on 
Baby Acapulco,164,Came in with a group of 15  and the service was terrible  It s understood that it s a big group but it s no excuse for our food to come over two hours after we ordered. Some of our party went to the bar to get a drink and we re asked where they were sitting before they even considered serving them. Do NOT come here with a big party  it s a terrible idea.
Baby Acapulco,165,Visited Baby A s this weekend i had the pleasure of dinning in and had the most wonderful experience. Mimi was my server she is the most pleasant person. Her warm beautiful smile and amazing attitude. I will go back just for that reason.
Baby Acapulco,166,A decent place to have some Tex Mex. Never had to wait for a table. The veggie fajitas we re good.
Baby Acapulco,167,Saturday night  ignored at both hostess stands  finally told that take a seat by what appeared to be one of the few waitstaff on duty  ignored for another 10 minutes  went to eat at the bar. Been there a dozen times  normally 2 Margs and I m good. This one was so weak all you could taste was sweet and sour. Had to order a shot to make it right. Barely edible  fried avocado  husband had chili rellano  also barely edible. Should have went with initial thought to get hell out of there. Felt  and tasted like a restaurant in steep decline.  And that is too bad  family owned place for 30 years and all. Austin is too much of a culinary town to survive this for very long. Get it together Baby A s. Please  
Baby Acapulco,168,I guess I really wasn t feeling Baby A s today. Service was really slow despite not being busy at all for a dinner service on a Saturday night. We were seating quickly -kudos B.A.  but it took about 15 minutes for the waitstaff to acknowledge that we were in their section. By the time she came around for the drink order we were already ready to order. Cool  this should speed things up right  Okay  maybe too sped up. I m used to hearing my fajitas before I see them. No sizzle  more like a Luke-warm slab of bell peppers and onions in my face. Had to really hunt for the beef. Where s tha beef  I m also used to the server saying  careful with the plate  it s hot . Guess he already knew I d have to heat up my food with the little lamp at the table...  Changed from 2 stars to 4 just because of Clarita. THANK YOU for reaching out and addressing this concern. I wish people understood that sometimes that s all it takes to change someone s mind about a review. Some good old  hey  we hear you and we want to make things right . I appreciate you taking the time to reach out. Good guest service goes a long way.
Baby Acapulco,169,Mirian C and Evelyn did a wonderful job. My friend and I came to this location for my birthday  Sept 4th and we re serviced by Evelyn then came back today Sept 7th and were helped by Mirian and they were both super friendly and attentive. Will definitely be returning for the great service and strong margaritas.
Baby Acapulco,170,I went in for dinner Friday night after a week of cabin fever because of the weather.  The atmosphere was warm and bustling which I found to be nurturing.  My server was Sheree.  She was engaging and friendly without being overbearing.  She had a good grasp of the menu.  So  when I told her I was gluten free and sugar sensitive she recommended the fish tacos on corn and the mexican martini.  Both hit the spot  I noticed Sheree had red lipstick to match her red Baby A s which I thought was a nice touch. The entire experience fed my body and soul.  Just what the doctor ordered 
Baby Acapulco,171,Hello Sunshine  It feels great to be at an outdoor restaurant  listening to music after all this flooding.  It s been some time since we last visited this location. Nice to see they ve updated part of the patio  amp  the menu had a fresh look with a couple of new items.   We began our Friday with a couple of Mango Ritas that did not disappoint. Although it took some time for our food to arrve  we didn t mind it. We thoroughly enjoyed listening to  Nudge  perform. Thanks for the TGIF entertainment   I ordered Yayos al pastor tacos  yummy  My husband ordered the deluxe dinner which he enjoyed. If it didn t take 45 minutes to receive our food   it might have rated a little better.
Baby Acapulco,172,A rat running on their outside patio. Waiter said its a possum  no  its not ... Its a rat...they dont care
Baby Acapulco,173,My fianc  and I went to baby A s just recently and we had an amazing experience. The host Alyssa was very friendly as soon as we walked in and she sat us in Miriam s section and she took excellent care of us. Our food was hot and our drinks were cold 10 out of 10. I would recommend Baby A s to anyone that is looking for a fun and friendly dining experience.
Baby Acapulco,174,Our waitress was very attentive and available despite her large section. The food was on point. But the lights wrapped around the trees at night made such an amazing environment  my favorite part  for good food and good talks.
Baby Acapulco,175,We are from out of state and staying at a hotel near Baby A.  We just walked over and were immediately greeted in a grand Texas fashion and seated.  Sheree was our waitress and was absolutely awesome    Her personality was as if we had know her for years    She was incredibly attentive  even with a large customer base. The manager also greeted us and was very interested in our dining experience.   I order fajitas and my wife ordered a salad.  Both were very high quality.  The margaritas were superb    Two thumbs up 
Baby Acapulco,176,My coworker and I had such a positive experience here. John  Ramos  was very very attentive to our table and he checked on us very frequently. We are going to ask to sit as his table every time    the margaritas are amazing 
Baby Acapulco,177,Awesome purple margs and enchiladas. Sergio was the best server we ve had in a long time and we will ask for him in the future. The band outside was great as well. Highly recommend Stonelake Baby A s and ask for Sergio 
Baby Acapulco,178,Great food. Great service. Great drinks. Yum. Go go go  Sam was a great waiter  Go fast 
Baby Acapulco,179,Just wanted to say the purple margaritas are great. Food and atmosphere were great as well.
Baby Acapulco,180,The prices are very reasonable for the portion size  the drinks are strong  and our server  John  was very accommodating of our orders and requests.  Overall a very positive experience  planning to come back.
Baby Acapulco,181,Unless you are coming here to drink  pass in the food.. It is not sit down quality food for the price. Drinks are good and happy hour prices are not bad. Adding to my review  they will not deviate from the lunch menu  no substitutions. They brought out 2 salsas for a table of 9  And 2 baskets of chips 
Baby Acapulco,182,We have always enjoyed babyAs. The tortilla soup is amazing  but lately we have noticed they are not keeping up with maintaining the structure or the grounds. It is a shame because it is a cool place.
Baby Acapulco,183,Great patio. Spacious with live music. Food is ok. Only going for drinks for now. Must try purple ritas.
Baby Acapulco,184,Went there to celebrate with some friends on a Friday just after lunch rush. Ordered two fajitas-for-two plates with additional shrimp and black beans. Both plates arrived and were not sizzling like fresh-off-the-grill fajitas usually come. These were more like  we made too many batches and hold these under the heat lamp for some sucker . The meat was dry  the shrimp were small  and the general portion was not conducive for sharing for two  let alone four  a double order .   Probably not returning to this particular location any time soon. Sam s Boat is just around the corner.
Baby Acapulco,185,Sat outside at table 20.  Great environment and really enjoyed the patio and fall weather.  That s all I can say good about the place.  Got there at 6p  ordered margaritas and food at 6 15 .  I know exactly what time it was because we checked to make sure we were in happy hour.  Chips and salsa were brought promptly  but we were almost done with the salsa and chips when our waitress still had not brought our waters.  At 6 55 I ask about our margaritas and she said  You just ordered waters right    My gf wanted to leave  but the waitress said she would have the margaritas out right away and the food was coming out now. At 7 02 we finally admitted defeat and left.  I ll never go back.
Baby Acapulco,186,The purple margaritas are soooo good. Evelyn was an awesome server  I ll definitely be back 
Baby Acapulco,187,Great place  Live music on the weekends    Best margaritas to drop your panties     ASK FOR CHAD HE IS THE BEST SERVER THERE   
Baby Acapulco,188,Really wish I could give 0 stars. This has been one of my favorite spots for years. My friends and I have been drinking purples foreverrrrrr. Anyway  my best friend just got married to a man from Africa who just moved to the country a few months ago. We got him so hyped up for trying the purple margarita and when we got there  the waiter said that the manager had to take a second look at his ID  understandable since he is from Africa  and most people aren t used to out of the country identification . Anyway  the manager came back and said no way and made it super clear that my friend s new husband MUST bring his passport from Africa if he wanted to drink. We made it a big deal and clearly asked them  if he comes back with his passport  he can drink a purple marg   and the answer was an overwhelming  yes.  So two days later there we were  waltzing into Baby A s  our friend with 3 solid forms of ID and his African passport. And yet again  he gets denied  because it has to be an  American government issued ID  which doesn t make ANY sense because he is a LEGAL IMMIGRANT that lives here now. Clearly  we could consider this a form of discrimination. Be careful if you have friends that are from a different country because they will not be allowed to drink in this establishment. Apparently  Baby Acapulco is more strict than border control. Only people from America are given purple margaritas.
Baby Acapulco,189,This place has rly fallen off. Margarita was bland and sour  sent it back. Chkn fajitas chewy and chkn quesadillas were more like finger food with chewy chkn. Too many better TexMex options in Austin.
Baby Acapulco,190,I stopped by here to grab a bite before going to a movie  and to my surprise the service was good but the food was awful.   To my opinion I would rather pay that over priced junk food at the theater than coming back here.
Baby Acapulco,191,This place is a pleasant surprise.  Most chain Mexican restaurants serve ho hum food  figuring they can ride it out on the party atmosphere and lots of beer and tequila sales.  Food execution at Baby Acapulco is a cut above.  Yeah  the menu is standard American-Mex    tacos  nachos  enchiladas  fajitas all with the predictable sauces and trimmings.  However  someone is doing the right thing in the kitchen.  Beef in a burrito is usually cheap tasteless stuff  since heck  the burrito is going to drown the meat in tortilla  rice and beans with jalapenos for extra disguise. So you might as well put in  meat packing material .  The fajita beef here is cooked to a perfect medium rare and is full of flavor. The beef burrito actually tastes like a good steak ...   Onions are usually cooked to indifference in Mexican sauces  no longer having the tang of a fresh onion but not caramelized either. Onions here are cooked very al dente  so they have fresh bite and a good vegetable taste  having been on the grill just long enough to take the edge off them.  Someone is buying good meat and good onions and is watching them very carefully on the grill - which is not usually the case in Chain-Mex.  So this place is a step above.  Sure  there are other mexican restaurants you can go to in Austin for unique dishes  cooking in a distinctive personal style   or where you can do the fine dining experience.  But this place is very solid on the standards.  Anywhere outside of the American Southwest or Chicago  it would be a destination Mexican restaurant  Footnote  I notice that my experience was substantially more positive than that of other Yelp readers. There may be a reason for this.  I reviewed this place at 2 pm on a slow weekday afternoon. The place was 5-10  filled. My food was pretty good and care and attention was shown with the meal.  It is entirely possible that quality may go down in the middle of big rushes when the staff is heavily worked. The complaints of indifferent cooking and slow cleaning - are consistent with a situation where the rush is on and both food prep and cleaning are being rushed or deferred in the interest of serving a lot of drinks.  It could be that I was just lucky - but I suspect Baby Acapulco is one way when  things are quiet - and another way during the big happy hours and weekend nights.
Baby Acapulco,192,Great Tortilla Soup.  Really good chicken enchiladas as well.  Funny building but they do have live music on weekends.    Those purple margaritas just scare me but the Mango one is yummo.
Baby Acapulco,193,Love Baby As - service was exceptional tonight. Our server Keona was wonderful  Soup is the BEST    
Baby Acapulco,194,Had the best service for our workshop dinner. I called ahead of time and they brought in Karla  who works at another location  to help out and gotta say she was on her game  Props to her for taking care of our large group of 35 people and getting us having patience with us. Thanks  Karla for providing top-notch service for our group. Food and drinks were amazing as always.
Baby Acapulco,195,The queso is not good at all. I was very disappointed  Our server was way over worked and we hardly ever saw him. The actual facility has great potential. Would be best not in the summer though.
Baby Acapulco,196,John R was amazing  Not only was the food great and made fresh but John R was very attentive and made sure my dinner date went perfect. Thank you for a lovely evening 
Baby Acapulco,197,food was good but service was lousy yesterday  7 23 14 .  Wasn t the servers fault though.  The restaurant decided to book 2-3 events at the same time one of which was a movie screening with 100 people attending so everyone else s orders were slow.  30 minutes for friends to get a beer no thank you I will go somewhere else.    Also we had to sit outside because the hostess was reserving the vacant tables for the special event.  They have plenty of fans outside but of course none of them worked so we had to sit there and bake.    Manager was informed and did not give a discount for lack of service to make up for it.  Not complaining about quality of food though but Won t be coming back here.
Baby Acapulco,198,Krystal was fantastic   The staff is very friendly and helpful  They are there to make sure you have a great time  
Baby Acapulco,199,This was our first time here and let me tell you  the food is delicious but what s even better is the service.  Our server John R was super friendly and courteous. Great food and excellent service at a good price  oh let s not forget those amazing margaritas   You must give it a try   
Baby Acapulco,200,Mexican martini was excellent   Alexa took care of our large party which was no easy task   We willbe back  
Baby Acapulco,201,On a sunny Sunday afternoon  1 23 pm 2-9-14    I waited so long for a waiter on the patio that I went inside to order.  The patio was filling up with tables and we hadn t even gotten water yet because there was no  waiter in sight.  I mentioned this to a nearby table who was there even longer and they said the same thing.  The food was ok for the price   but the service was way below other Baby A s locations.  Trust the other reviews or take your chances...
Baby Acapulco,202,I was never so disrespected at a restaurant.  I ve been here previously without issue but today the B team was in charge and it showed.   Not sure I will ever return
Baby Acapulco,203,Enjoyed a birthday dinner for a friend here. We were a large group and our waitress was fantastic  The entire waitstaff sang happy birthday and treated the birthday girl to a complimentary flan. Margaritas were delish  Overall great night.
Baby Acapulco,204,I came into today for a drink and dinner. I had the delicious taco bowl and a mexican martini. I am writing this review bc i had the best bartender serving me. His name is Bobby. Fab service. He is amazing  helpful  and super attentive. If you come here  ask for Bobby. He told me what was good to eat and drink here.
Baby Acapulco,205,Seeing the large number of low reviews here  you d think that the management would take some steps to up the level of service.  We went a week ago today  and despite e-mailing the manager directly AND another location to request a regional manager or district manager to contact  I have had no further contact from them.  They obviously just  don t get it .  We experienced nearly the absolute WORST waiter in history -  Alice  - on our visit.  Rude  disrespectful and downright ugly a few times in our brief encounters with her.  We complained about a few things and yes  they comp d a couple of items off our bill  but that wasn t why we wanted to go there  to get free things.  We wanted a nice relaxing evening with some good food and needed good service.  We received the opposite  and it reflected in our ZERO tip to the waitress.  She was absolutely THE WORST.    If I ever return to this establishment  I ll definitely ask to be reseated if sat in her section or ask for another waiter.  Worst experience of my dining life.  Several problems   margarita tasted like crap  she didn t take both of our orders and we only received one  had to wait for the other  she refused to come check on us to see if we needed anything  if things were alright  etc.  She did everything a waiter should NEVER go.  While the manager was nice  I do expect the courtesy of a return e-mail or call when I take the time to let you know what kind of an experience I had at your location.  Be warned - it s bad  very very bad.  Looking for better mexican food  amp  better service   Try Rio Grande in Pflugerville.  It s everything Baby A s wants to be but fails on.
Baby Acapulco,206,We went with nine people to eat since this place was by our hotel. The sitting area was full and we asked for a table. The hostess said it would be a half hour wait. We moved over to the area by the patio to sit and wait for our table.  A rude employee came over and stated to us that there was another baby A restraunt 10 minutes driving distance away with no wait. We asked him if we could place a to go order and he stated the to go order would take as long as the wait for our table. We told him we could wait for the table. The same rude employee came over to us and asked if we could wait for a table inside. We stated it was cooler outside  but he insisted we move inside. We moved inside and continued to wait for our tabe. They sat every person in the restraunt  including people that came in after us. My daughter went over and asked about the wait. Then the same rude employee can over and said   what is the problem here. We told you the wait was till 7 55.  We pointed out it was 8 10. He said  well we are just taking longer then.  My daughter stated there was an empty table. He stated   that is your table and we will seat you when it is ready.   The table was empty and wiped down.No one was over by the table working on it. The employee then stated   I do not want to seat your party  because you have been rude to me  and I am afraid you will be rude to your servers too.  I told him that he was the one being rude and asked to speak to the manager. He stated he was the manager. I told him I was uncomfortable eating in the place due to his behavior and attitude. He stated  well you can leave then.  He continued to be rude and finally stated that we had to leave due to our attitude. We left. When we left we had waited there an hour and fifteen minutes  when the original time given was 30 minutes . I have never seen a manager of a buisiness ever display such unprofessional service. His demeanor made our whole group feel unwelcome in the restaurant. I feel like he did not want us there and had no intention of getting us a table in a timely manner. To make matters worse every word he spoke was in a sarcastic irritated tone of voice  so it did not come across as sincere.   His name is James Galvan. He did not have a business card. Perhaps he chooses not to make buisiness cards due too him having unprofessional management skills. When I asked him for his name  he pointed to his badge and said  my name is right here.   I have been to different baby A locations in Austin before for 20 years and never was treated this way. I am sure you will continue to loose buisiness by keeping James Galvan as a manger of your restraunt . I wanted to post this to make everyone aware of James Galvan s behavior and attitude.  I was not surprised to see that reviews of this location were not 5 star. Perhaps under more professional management the ratings would improve. I am not sure if I will return to any baby A restraunt. I am sure I will never return this location in Austin  Texas on 9505 Stonelake Blvd as long James Galvan is the manager.
Baby Acapulco,207,I went to baby a s on the advice of a coworker. Now I have been a couple of times And I love it  The first time another coworker and I our server was a bubbly gal by the name Charlie. She answered all of our questions and even went to the kitchen to ask the cook the one totally obscure question that my coworker asked that she didn t know. Even though she was the only server on duty at the time  she kept our drinks coming. I did not have to ask her for refills and I never saw the bottom of my glass  It was refreshing to get a server who anticipated your needs instead of having to be asked.  The second time I took my sister a few days later because I was craving their soup. I ordered the Helen s combo so that I could try their enchiladas. The enchiladas the puffy taco and the soup we re fabulous 
Baby Acapulco,208,Baby A s is always amazing   We had a wonderful waiter tonight - Raul.  He hasn t taken care of our table before.  Raul was attentive and did a fantastic job.  He was friendly and continued to check back on our needs.  Would love to have him wait on us again 
Baby Acapulco,209,I give this location a higher rating than the others because it s a great space. There s a good number of parking spots  but it gets tight during buddy times.   This is a place you go for happy hour and appetizers. I wouldn t recommend bringing friends visiting from our of town or going there hungry. The food snob in me knows better.
Baby Acapulco,210,I absolutely love this place. This location has an awesome patio  where on the weekends they bring in a live band for entertainment. Their margaritas are AWESOME  and a good selection of beer. The tortilla soup is delicious  and very fresh tasting. My favorite is their crispy chicken tacos  DEVINE  Salsa and chips are always on point as well. Family friendly  and a fun place to go out with your friends. I highly recommend this location. The one in Pflugerville off of I-35 is good too  they redid their bar area last year and its really nice. Give Baby A s a try 
Baby Acapulco,211,Dude  holy crap  lol  To say worse service ever is an understatement. At one point  we thought about getting up and going elsewhere but then just decided to hang in there just to see how the night play out. Thankfully  with a few Margaritas  a very patient sister who just decided to take over the situation  the terrible service became funny and amusing so we didn t leave pissed off. But oh how we should have    Walked in on a Friday night. Visited the hostess stand and requested outside seating. The host told us to walk down to the patio  find someone in a stripped shirt  and he ll take care of us. Cool  right  Except in a sea of people swarming  the striped shirt is no where to be found   Light blue striped shirt  no name tag . After flagging down a waitress  she helps us find him. That was about after 20 minutes. Great band playing  no biggie. But then we find him and he tells us to go back to the original host stand  Now I m irrate. So I walk up to the host stand  which isn t close  btw   and the guy proceeds to blow me off  Like looks at me  looks at his other choices of ppl to help  and helps them until all options have run out for him. So when those options ran out  I asked to speak with a manager  immediately   nice - still patient here  but firm . He looks up  sees someone very slowly walking through the door  then tells me to hold on. Oh no you don t buddy  I said immediately. And now I m losing my patience. The manager himself was not much help except for finding the striped guy. Waited some more. A lot more. Watched ppl come in after us and be seated  and still waited. Great band though so not too bad. Finally sit.   And wait. And flagged someone down. And ordered a super high end Margarita to have it taste like water from sitting too long. Ice melted and everything. Are you exhausted reading this yet   I m exhausted writing it. I ll wrap it up by saying the night just continued in this fashion. Awful     Our arrival time was 7 23pm. By the time we ate  I kid you not  10 39pm. Thank God for the great band and great company for distraction.   Oh  and did a manager EVER come by to apologize or even check on us  Lol  you re kidding  right 
Baby Acapulco,212,Connie was the best  We came in an hour before closing and she served us with a smile and good conversation the entire time. The food was awesome and the purple was on point. come here 
Baby Acapulco,213,We came to have food and drinks with a party of 6 on a Friday night around 9. The place is not busy. We sit a table on the patio  server tells us it s a closed section. Ok  no biggie. So we go to the bar to order drinks because no open tables on the patio currently. We are told  if you want to sit on the patio  you can t order drinks from the bar . Ok. So we finally get a table with a number on it on the patio  as we were told to do . Server comes up and says section is closed again. Bartender won t serve us  we do as we re told as far as tables go. Literally no one can help us  Finally one server is helpful  he was compensated even tho we never got to eat or drink because of the frustration of trying   gets us a table set up outside of his section. No one ever comes to greet us or serve us. So we leave. All service industry  so we weren t rude or even asking for much. Very understanding about the situations that kept being tossed at us. Worst baby a experience ever.
Baby Acapulco,214,When you come to Baby A s request a tall dark haired gentleman named Bobby. He is the most ambitious  forward thinking  and attentive waiter we have had the pleasure of being served by in a long time in this town. He knew what to ask us for even before we thought of asking for it. The queso and mushrooms was fantastic. They could serve mediocre food and we would still come back just to see Bobby.
Baby Acapulco,215,This place was DRASTICALLY UNDERSTAFFED when we were here on a recent Wednesday night at 7 30.  When my party of five arrived  we stood in the entry area along with several other groups  probably 15-18 people total  for almost ten minutes before an employee noticed we were there   During that time  I saw no employees anywhere in the restaurant. I was trying to go find someone to ask if we should just seat ourselves but there was no one to be found   When we were seated  our waiter Ruben was fairly attentive  which was surprising given that he appeared to be the only waiter on the floor for the entire circular section. He was a nice guy and seemed very competent but given the number of tables he was helping he did forget a drink order and forgot to take our meal order  but I actually was willing to look past this as he must have been pretty overwhelmed.  My friend asked Ruben to recommend an enchilada. Ruben replied   well if you like shrimp  I d recommend the shrimp. If you like beef  I d recommend the beef. If you like chicken  I d recommend the chicken.   Hmm.  The food ended up being pretty decent. I ordered the carne guisada and cleaned my plate. The margarita was strong enough to give me a little buzz.   During our visit  my friend and I played a game to see who could thank Ruben more grandiosely each time he came around to check on us which wound up being the highlight of the night.  I doubt I would come back here again unless an out-of-town friend specifically wanted to check it out  or if I was intentionally trying to kill a few hours.
Baby Acapulco,216,I used to go to the location by I35 and Howard until I found this one  The outdoor seating area is definitely what pulled me in  Love the food. Our server could have been a little more attentive the last time we visited  but she WAS taking care of the whole patio on a beautiful day  I really do love this location. My new Purple Rita spot for sure 
Baby Acapulco,217,Absolutely love the food here  Amazing fajitas  The staff is always super nice. Ask for Raiza  she s one of the best waiters there. David always makes sure we have chips and went above and beyond to ensure everything was ok. Great team work.  Overall  I love Baby A s  guarantee you will too   Highly recommend  5 Stars     
Baby Acapulco,218,Decent Tex-Mex food  service could have been better. Was on the patio on St. Patty s Day  many empty tables  several servers on the patio and no service for 30 min at a time. Several of the other tables  servers were checking on us and serving us because it was kinda getting ridiculous and I don t have the highest expectations.  - 
Baby Acapulco,219,Ate with a work colleague at Baby A s tonight for the first - and last - time.  The food was not great and the service was worse.  We walked in and it took forever to even be seated.  Wait service was terrible.  At the end of the meal finally had to go find someone to pay our bill.  Ordered the Baby Changa - chicken filling was chewy.  Tried to get a margarita on the rocks - tasted horrible.  Skip it....
Baby Acapulco,220,Sat for 12 minutes without silverware while my food got cold.  When the lady finally came back with the utensils  I told her it was too late and I was leaving.  The food had sat there for 12 minutes.  She said   Fine   and walked away.  I left.  Don t go here.  Terrible experience.
Baby Acapulco,221,To start  I have food poisoning today  and I went to Baby A s yesterday. By eliminating other foods I ve had this week as they were eaten with others who do not have food poisoning  I am confident my food poisoning came from Baby A s. I had never been here before and had heard mixed reviews. I am definitely siding with the negative reviews.   The food poisoning alone should hopefully be enough to encourage you to steer clear of Baby A s  but I ll review my meal too in case you need any other reasons to stay away. I tried their  famous  purple margarita. I m fairly certain it is purple because it is grape cough syrup mixed with margarita mix. At least that is exactly what it tastes like. Is it strong  Yes  but it tastes terrible and costs a small fortune. For my meal I ordered the taco salad. It was tiny for the price and was just a tortilla shell bowl full of shredded iceberg lettuce with some toppings. This is far from the  fresh lettuce  listed in the menu. It comes topped with ground beef   tomatoes  cheese  and sour cream. The beef is flavorless  and the cheese is low quality. I believe one of those two was the culprit for my illness.   Overall  I am unimpressed with Baby A s. It was expensive  lacked flavor  except the margarita which just had terrible flavor   and gave me food poisoning. Needless to say  I will not be returning.
Baby Acapulco,222,Our sever Alexa Wolff was AWESOME    She made sure our glasses were always full and our service was amazing  we will definitely be back because of her  
Baby Acapulco,223,A third of the tables are empty but the hostess says    there is a twenty minute wait. They are two parties in front of you.   UsualTex-Mex menu at reasonable prices. Good but not great food.  Consistently understaffed so average to poor service is the normal here. Baby A s survives not because of great food or service but because it is the only Mexican restaurant in the Arboretum.
Baby Acapulco,224,Horrible customer service. Im a server so i usually let a lot of things side but the manager Regina is something else
Baby Acapulco,225,I come here occasionally with my mom and daughter. It s definitely a toss-up if we re going to get good service or not. I came here today for happy hour with a friend and we got a waiter that provided good service  but tried to sing to us the whole time. We are nice and tried to go along with it  but it was very VERY uncomfortable. A woman from a table across from us interrupted him at one point to help us out. Two other guests at different tables even asked us what was going on. This location really needs to keep a better eye on their servers. Great atmosphere  food and drinks  but the service is very questionable.
Baby Acapulco,226,Average Mexican food. Beer was cold and within walking distance to Embassy Suites Arboretum. Salsa good and spicy. I d eat there again.
Baby Acapulco,227,I arranged and attended a work function here recently. In fact  this was our second in maybe a year and a half here. This was done on very short notice on our part  and Baby A s stepped up and accommodated us with open arms. They had a terrific set up for us in a comfortable and spacious room for ourselves. The appetizer buffet was well received by the group. Evie was particularly helpful in making sure we were taken care of  as was our server  I m sorry that I can t remember his name  I m very bad with names  . I recall that our previous function went very well also. I have nothing but positive things to say about this Baby A s and would definitely recommend based on my experiences.
Baby Acapulco,228,Staff was friendly and the purple margarita for  8.75 was good for the price since it was strong. Got chips and salsa included with it. Glad I finally got to try their storied purple margarita.
Baby Acapulco,229,Sometimes  in the middle of a hectic stressful week and you don t want to cook or clean up after  you stop in at your local beloved Baby A s. This location has had some serious lows but lately it s been on a serious upswing both food and service wise. I frequent this location a lot as it s super close by.  Tonight  my sangria margarita. enchiladas Texanas  and salsa were perfect and my waitress Evelyn P.  was 6 stars  She was super helpful  friendly  and competent. I requested an item sub and she made sure my order was accurate. Evelyn was extremely attentive but not overbearing. Don t let her go  Overall  the latest changes have proved most positive at the Stonelake location 
Baby Acapulco,230,Love goingto baby as on Sundays for two reason the breakfast bolw wich is delicious along with my dos equis michelada  Yum and the great waitress Lizbeth   she always takes care of us she is so attentive always working hard but always checking if her customers are doing great 
Baby Acapulco,231,This place is great  Everyone is so nice and prompt  Our waiter alisa was great  The purple margarita will have you feeling like you ve drank 10 drinks lol. I guess thats why there is a 2 drink minimum. The manager james definitely cares about his customers. He was literally table touching in a wheel chair   I most definitely will always come to this location     
Baby Acapulco,232,We visited mimi this past friday with my friends that came in from Dallas. like always she makes sure were taken care of   she always tries to make recommendations or new ideas that we havent tried. This past weekend she recommended the new pink churros..and they were amazing    thank you mimi for always being so caring fyi mimi just got into medical school congratulate her and tip her well she might treat your health one day   
Baby Acapulco,233,Bad customer service. I placed a to-go order and it didn t include chips and salsa. I asked the hostess why they were not included and she said there s an additional charge for to-go orders  even though they re free if you dine in. This is a ridiculous charge especially since any other Tex-Mex restaurant includes them free of charge.
Baby Acapulco,234,This place used to be one of my favorite North Austin eateries  though it seems to have really gone downhill in the last few years.  My best guess is that the business is not doing all that great  so they re making cuts to save money.  I used to love the seafood enchiladas  but now the sauce is watery and there was notably less meat  which was overcooked.  They even cheaped out on the beans  which were at least a third water.  My friend ordered the soup  which  again  was more water than soup.   I m severely disappointed.  I miss the old Baby-A s...
Baby Acapulco,235,RAW chicken  and thoughtless manager  Eating at this Baby A s could be detrimental to your health because the cooks do not care enough to ensure that they are not serving RAW chicken.  Ordered the Chipotle Chicken Dinner....First several bites seemed fine  but when I cut into the center of the cutlet the chicken was slimy  very pink  and COMPLETELY RAW  Not sure how much raw chicken I might have actually eaten.  The manager  A. Rodriguez   acted like it was no big deal when I talked with him. They comped my meal  but did not seem a bit concerned about possibly exposing a customer to Salmonella and Campylobacter - both of which can cause serious illness and even DEATH IN HUMANS.   a href   redir url http 3A 2F 2Fwww.webmd.boots.com 2Fdigestive-disorders 2Ffood-poisoning amp s 3e480c910cbdbe19c50b5021c402d570d0dc0df77c916e354ff38db4dfe20def  rel  nofollow  target  _blank  webmd.boots.com digestiv   a    The next few days should be interesting...hoping that I do not get sick.  Talked to my MD and you can anticipate sudden onset of nausea  cramping and diarrhea 6 to 72 hours after eating salmonella infected food. Campylobacter infection may take two to 5 days to become apparent. This will normally include diarrhea  fever  stomach cramps  nausea and vomiting .  The Chipotle Chicken Dinner should be renamed  pollo crudo  or  Pollo con Salmonella.    Eating at this Baby A s could be detrimental to your health because the cooks do not care enough to ensure that they are not serving RAW chicken.
Baby Acapulco,236,Very great place to eat. I ordered the grilled chicken  salad and it was delicious.  Great service.  Could have been a little cooler in the restaurant but it was so big I think it just couldn t keep up with as hot as it was outside.
Baby Acapulco,237,My mom and dad came in to town Friday night from Houston and we all wanted mexican food. My daughter has a severe soy allergy so I called first and talked to Tim the manger. He said that it should not be a problem. We arrived and I met Tim and after we were seated our waitress and Tim checked with the chefs and made sure that there was no soy in the food my daughter was eating. They took special care to cook everything separate. Most of us had fajitas and they were fantastic but all the entrees were good. A big thank you goes out to Tim and the rest of the staff at Baby Acapulco s. Great food and great service 
Baby Acapulco,238,I ve been to this location a few times and the service was okay. Veronica G gave my husband and I great service. Well mannered and was very attentive. The food and drinks were really good. I do recommend the Claritas Chicken and the Watermelon Crush is a perfect Margarita for the summer.
Baby Acapulco,239,Omg  It took forever to get our food. This  seriously some bad service. We re not coming back. It was really a case of a bad waiter. Took forever to get drinks. Had to ask for silverware  plates for our queso and our check. I can stand it when tables that arrived after us are getting their food way before us. My husband is still waiting to pay and that s after I cleaned up all three kids and gotten loaded in the car. I ve had a lot of time to type this up. Save yourself and go somewhere else.
Baby Acapulco,240,No.  Just No.  I went here for a good bye lunch for a coworker.  I guess most people like this place because they make  purple margaritas  which I understand essentially are grain alcohol and  purple .  Since it was lunch I wasn t drinking  and the food was less than marginal.  I had the Tacos al Pastor.  They came with a pile of passable Spanish rice and watery charro beans.  The pork was fatty and not especially flavorful.  The good parts were the corn tortillas  seemed freshly made  and the cilantro and onions were fresh and aromatic.  The atmosphere at Baby A s is pure  volume Tex Mex .  Get  em in  stuff  em full of starch and grain alcohol  and get  em out.    The only way I m returning to Baby A s is for the exact same reason I went today - it was a work lunch and someone else paid the bill.
Baby Acapulco,241,This place is hard to review..... mainly because I didn t really have a meal here. I was on a quest for Sopaipillas  every ones  except people in Austin... and fans of flan....ok  maybe just me  favorite Mexican dessert. After dozens of calls all over town  we finally found a place that sold them.... and better yet  the Sopaipillas were served with Amy s Mexican Vanilla Ice Cream. Yum. The Sopaipillas didn t disappoint. But the restaurant gave me a strange vibe.  I would have liked to been at the meeting when this place first opened.    You know what people love.......Mexican food     ........Don t forget about elephants  People also LOVE elephants     ok  ok  How about a PINK elephant .... .isn t that CRAZY     Wait  wait  wait...... how about an island theme     Hold up..... people also like babies..... we can t forget about that one   The chips in salsa didn t taste super good  the TV s were really outdated  there were people smoking on the outdoor indoor patio  yuck   and the band was really weird.   The sopaipillas get 4 stars.... the resturaunt gets 2.
Baby Acapulco,242,Went to Baby A s for happy hour yesterday. I had that  I m needing a purple  kind of day. You really go here for the everclear  purple  margarita... not the food. This mexican food is not so bueno. Guacamole tastes strangely un-fresh yet green... how do they fool mother nature like that   We also had the queso compuesto  which isn t bad and goes well with the slightly stale chips.  First time I went there  I had one  purple   then some other fruity margarita concoction  and decided to have another purple  not sure if I somehow confused the girl and then over purple d or what...  but I ended up thinking karaoke sounded like a good time. Be forewarned.
Baby Acapulco,243,Magic things come in small glasses. And  er  they serve food here     It s in my best interest to stay seated  thanks.
Baby Acapulco,244,I always end up at this location with the same friends and each and every time the same one of them goes   Hey  guys  do y all remember when this was a Bahama Breeze      And each and every time the answer is exactly the same   No .   If any of you lived in Austin and REMEMBER when this Baby A s was the Bahama Breeze  henceforth to be known as BB  then I bow to you  oh soldier of time.   This Baby A s location is meh. It s sort of hidden behind a huge parking garage and mass quantities of trees near the Arboretum. I totally should have heeded the fact that the location is kind of BFE  bum flipping Egypt  and not gone. The awful palm tree covered booths still haven t been recovered after the BB acquisition and they re starting to completely deteriorate.  The food is also meh. I ve had carnitas and bean and cheese nachos and can tell you both were completely forgettable.  The only saving grace  The drinks were strooooooooooooong. Mayhaps you should go for happy hour only   If you really feel the need  though I ve no idea why you would  to hit up Baby A s  then you should definitely hit up a different location.
Baby Acapulco,245,A great night out great food  nice patio environment  live band  but the professionalism of the staff especially Keona set it apart. She was attentive  knowledgeable  amp  extremely personable. I will definitely ask for her the next time I go to Baby A s.
Baby Acapulco,246,Love to hang out at Baby A s for a margarita  Best salsa and queso. My favorite on the menu  baby chimichanga   Mmmhmmm yummy   Superman margarita is fabulous 
Baby Acapulco,247,During a shopping excursion  a client asked if we could break for lunch here.  My initial reaction was   yuck   but it was her treat so I figured why not.    Well  call me a convert.  I can t speak to anything else on the menu  but my client insisted the tortilla soup and the veggie fajitas were to die for and my gawd  you ve never had anything so fresh  unique  and flavorful.  I was truly in heaven and would go back in a heartbeat if it meant tasting those flavors again.  Our waiter left a little to be desired.  HIM  How re you doin   US  Great  and you  HIM  I m glad to be leaving soon. US  Oh yeah   What time do you get off  HIM  I don t know....I guess whenever you guys leave.  In other words   you re the only things keepin  me here  ya bitches    Making patrons feel like they are somehow inconveniencing you by eating in the restaurant that employs you   That attitude is not only rude  it tends to inspire lackluster tips.    Just sayin .
Baby Acapulco,248,Worst service EVER     We were sitting there for over 20 minutes and no one ever came to get our order. There was another couple that came in after us and within 5 mins the waiter came to take their order. Asked to speak to manager and he didn t seem to care of how upset we were. This place is just flat out horrible   I wish we could do no stars because that is what they deserve..
Baby Acapulco,249,When a drink is purple  that s your first clue.  I got up from my booth to go to the bathroom at Baby A s.  It was my first time there.  When I stood up  I got the sensation that one of my ass cheeks was stationed about where my left knee was.  I was holding on to the edge of a table  the way toddlers who are learning to walk do.  I looked over at the purple drink I had gotten  and saw that it was only a quarter gone.  So I had only 1 4 of the purple drink  and I had forgotten how to walk.  It is my hope that I actually used the bathroom facilities  I don t remember.    I m pretty sure that the magic behind the purple drink takes maybe 20 hours to brew per day  with like potions  magic-summoning dances  and other sacrifical rituals.  That doesn t allow for much time to prepare food.  So don t order food.  Problem solved.
Baby Acapulco,250,The only reason this place gets 2 stars instead of 1 is because of their purple ritas. They are really good and their frozen drink machines work well. Besides that  the place pretty much sucks. The service is slow  the food below average. I also hate the  gratuity added to parties of 6 or more.  I m pretty sure the majority of their business at this location comes from the offices around here. That said  they re almost always serving groups. Forcing someone to tip for service that is slow is a good way to piss people off  myself included.  I ll visit Baby A s again  but I ll never eat lunch or dinner. Stick with the purple ritas and you ll think the place is fine. Go so far as to order a meal and you re sure to be disappointed  unless you re from out of town and have no idea what good Mexican food tastes like.
Baby Acapulco,251,Let s get one thing out of the way immediately.  I love the purple margaritas with everclear at Baby A s.  An alcoholic s dream drink.  l like them a LOT.  So that is the main reason we came here to start our night off before looking to get in trouble in the Arboretum area.  One of them takes away the stress of the drive down from Dallas.  Two and you are giggly and happy.  Three and you forget why you are even there in the first place.  Yum.   Yes  they will serve you more than two.  I guess you have to look like you are handling them ok or maybe it is server specific  I have no idea.   This Baby A s location is fun because the damn patio is bigger than the inside.  They have covered patio  non-covered patio  a fire pit for colder nights  and a band playing outside.  Apparently some nights are also karaoke but unfortunately for me - and fortunately for all the other patrons - it wasn t the night we were there.  I ordered the grilled fish tacos and turns out they were actually pretty good  or at least better than I remembered them from last time.  Light and not too filling so I could fit in more purples.  And that s really all you are there for right 
Baby Acapulco,252,So  we went to Baby Acapulco yesterday while it was still light outside.  Baaaad Idea   You can actually see to count the layers of grease and dirt on the tables  chairs  and even the hand rails.  The table of 4 behind us actually ran the ticket - who does that       And the Fantastico Platter was pure grease with a side of sour cream  ate the whole damn thing    So  I ordered a purple margarita  smiled  and planned my next trip to Baby A s.  GO PURPLE       I think I am still drunk from last night...
Baby Acapulco,253,I m having trouble deciding whether to give this place 2 or 3 stars. I have some friends that like to drink here. Seriously. Every time we want to hang out  they come here. And that pisses me off. And I m not sure if that s Baby A s fault.  Purple margaritas. Yes  they will get you drunk. Yes  you can taste the Everclear in them. Yes  that means that they do not taste good. You know what else gets you drunk and DOES taste good  Whiskey. If you want some fruity colored drink that has vague hints of rubbing alcohol  this is your spot.  The food is mediocre. Of all the times I ve come  I ve only eaten once. It wasn t awful  but it was pretty unexceptional. I m leaning towards 2 stars because I shouldn t have to eat mediocre psuedo-Mexican in Texas. It s not right.  People come here to watch football. Sometimes there s a shitty band playing outside. I can t understand why somebody would come here to drink. Argh. It s all so perplexing.  Fuck it  I m going with two stars. May I never have to set foot in this place again.
Baby Acapulco,254,Don t even bother going here unless you re in the mood for a margarita made with everclear  and even those taste like garbage  . But hey  if you can stomach the purple margarita  you might just forget about the cafeteria-quality Mexican food.   Chips and salsa  worse than Tostito s and Pace. And it really doesn t get better from there. The menu has all of the items you would expect a Mexican restaurant to have  but nothing tastes good except the Chicken Tortilla Soup. That s the only thing. If you must go here  get that. Nothing else  or you will regret it.  Now check this out  I get tricked into eating here often. It s a punishing feeling to spend money at Baby A s when there are so many other Mexican restaurants in Austin. It s just too easy to outdo. I prefer fast-food Mexican to this.  It would be nice if there was one aspect of this restaurant that made it stand out  but everything is meh or worse. I suggest spending your money somewhere else.
Baby Acapulco,255,Did not know how to make a classic martini. Food was to go and not bad to tell the truth. But  the service was not what I would want if this was my place. Had a huge impact on my rating. Bartender was sub par. I had the fajitas. Had it to go  and had to tell them how to pack it for my hotel room nearby. The bartender said hello when I arrived but took approx.10 min. to bring me a menu. The bar had two other people who had already eaten and were obviously on their third  or second beers  so I don t understand what took so long after we  just echanged pleasantries.      Also   it did not look clean and a place I would take people to eat. Service needs help.   bartender  and the overall look of the bar inside left little to be desired. Food was not bad. For takeout. This place is redeemable. If they take the advice from everyone who posted. Good luck. Hope you can take it to the next level.
Baby Acapulco,256,Absolutely vile  Lousy service  no silverware  no napkins  miniature glass of wine  tasteless food... then overcharged by  6.50  which I had to correct with the manager. Definitely low class.  How embarrassing. Never again. I will warn my friends.
Baby Acapulco,257,I was annoyed that my burger came out missing what I d requested  but the next burger to come out was  too. Get specific at your own risk  people. Neither order was fixed quickly.  The bathroom was missing only broken glass  discarded needles  and a flickering orange light. Water pooled behind the toilet  toilet paper was strung along and clumped  on the floor  the dispenser was empty  look up  the usable toilet paper hangs on a nail on the back of the door   and there were scratches  graffiti  broken tiles  and caulking in a deplorable state. If the manager is male  he uses this bathroom and knows how bad it is  right  It doesn t need cleaning  it needs construction.  After being in there  I noticed how run down the interior hall was. Replace that ancient carpet and the mirrors whose wood frames look like animals clawed at them in desperation not to be dragged off to be made into fajitas.  Depressing nastiness on top of a pattern of kitchen mistakes. Below  meh  and definitely not going back   1.
Baby Acapulco,258,If you ve ever thought to yourself that it s virtually impossible to mess up a taco  think again   Baby A s meat not only tastes like Alpo  but you also get to enjoy it in what looks like a land-locked version of a cruise ship.  We ate there a year ago and avoided the place like the plague ever since.  Then  we were in a hurry to get to a movie at Gateway across the street last night and thought we would give it another try. Doh  24 hours worth of stomach issues later  I m reminded of why we stayed away.  If you re going for quick Tex Mex  hit up El Arroyo or Jorge s.
Baby Acapulco,259,I absolutely love Sheree. She is the greatest server ever. She makes sure that I have a great time and enjoy my food every time.
Baby Acapulco,260,Ordered the chimichanga  the call it a Flaca Platter .  Call me sick  but I loved the deep-fried flour-chicken-cheese-grease combination that was called a chimichanga in my school lunch room  and I go searching for that experience from time to time.  No one has quite matched the joy for me yet  but BA s was closer than most.  That s supposed to be a compliment...  The atmosphere is completely laid back.  The wait staff was punctual but not annoyingly doting.  A baseball game was on the big screen so I didn t have to talk to my date if I didn t want to.  The house band just finished warming up when we arrived  and we were treated to some decent Tom Petty  ZZ Top  and Clapton covers during our meal.    The thing I liked best about BA s was the relaxed atmosphere.  If I were looking for an easy place to knock a few back after work or get down and tie one on with some friends  I could do much worse than this place.  Good food  good service  and an inviting  relaxed atmosphere.  What more do I want 
Baby Acapulco,261,We love Baby A s for their Famous tortilla soup  margaritas and the warm friendly atmosphere. We always get great service from Bobby and Ricky at the Bar. Friendly restaurant and a family like environment. The purple and Superman Rita s are our favorites.
Baby Acapulco,262,Well  I must be an alcoholic cause I don t think the purple margs are all that strong.  Seeing how that s most of the appeal of Baby A s  I can t see any reason to go here.  They re daaaaamn expensive for a drink too.    Some of the worst dinners I ve had in north Austin were outside at Baby A s when the band came on... music so bad and so loud I had to basically hoover my food and bail.
Baby Acapulco,263,Checked out Baby A s for the time in off-beat path location on Stonelake. Really tempted to give this one star but this first review in awhile. First off  the parking lot was filled  but the place was maybe 1 3 full of mostly after work drinkers. Service was Grade A terrible -- our waiter looked to have just been promoted from bus boy server and it showed. Food is typical tex-mex with too salty everything -- margarita special was  1off and 1 2 price appetizers that were basically crap. The Tv s are old tube style with bad color  the booths are too low  and ambient noise is bi-polar -- outside is a loud band  while inside is hush quiet 80 s tunes -- weird mix in my opinion.   Basically the extra star is for the band. They were good and their name was derived off of scraping off the old roofing sealant signage on their trailer to leave the words  the sea ants   clever.   overall  this place s management has probably gotten too used to the low standards of the afterwork  rita crowd so the food  service and indoor ambience suffers.
Baby Acapulco,264,I was just reading the reviews here  and the manager s responses. I gotta tell you  my stomach hurts from laughing so hard  Ahahahhahahah      Is this some kind of joke  Is this lady serious  Sounds like a 3rd grader writing these replies.   Look  lady  it s pretty obvious from these reviews that in general  your food sucks  your service sucks  and you have not a clue how to fix this on going mess. Do you collect  29k per year to sit at home on yelp and tell people you appreciate the idea that they like your margaritas  Wouldn t your time be better spent training the staff 
Baby Acapulco,265,Help    I feel like I ve been sleeping for a decade and just woke up  It seems like we ve been eating local  Cedar Park  a lot lately and I don t know what it s like in Austin anymore   We ve been to Baby A s more times than I can count over the years and I ve never seen it as lame as this past Sunday. Where is the crowd  the game on the big screen  the karaoke  the outdoor bar  the waiters or waitresses    The sign said  SEAT YOUR SELF   so we did. Chips and salsa came as soon as we sat down  but we waited forever for someone to give us the menus and take our drink order. It took so long I had to pick up the menu and utensils myself at the entrance of the restaurant. It took forever for our waiter to come take our drink order. It took forever for him to come back with our drinks. It took forever for him to come back to take our order. The only thing that didn t take forever was the food which came out in a reasonable amount of time. What am I missing  Have I been away that long or am I just imagining things  Do they have a new owner or new management  Didn t the waiters used to all wear burnt orange polo s because they all had black on today      
Baby Acapulco,266,It s just not the same Baby A s.  It s like the hipsters took over and destroyed it.  I guess it isn t Baby A s fault but it just didn t have the same taste and atmosphere.  Too touristy for my tastes.  The place could use some lights inside so you can read the menu.
Baby Acapulco,267,So back in the day this place was Bahama Breeze. Then they went out of business and Baby A s bought it.  Baby A s was cool  to me  when I was in college. Sure  purple margaritas with Everclear in it. Now  not so much. I d rather have a good tasting one with good liquor in it. Baby A s are known for strong drinks  but they are all mediocre and bland....just like their food. Everything here is bland and mediocre. The service is sub-par also. I think they ve realized that who typically comes here and that they lower quality service is the norm. I m not going to lie -- I come here every once in a while  but I don t expect much and would prefer to go many other places.  So if you are in college and want a strong drink and cheap Mexican food  then go here. If you are done with college  go somewhere else.
Baby Acapulco,268,No you lost my business after 3 days to respond. I ll try another one. She didn t tell a manager  I wanted to talk to a manager. And you are just going to say you ll talk to your staff. How about you tell me you re going to fix it and the next visit is going to be amazing. I ve seen you copy and paste the same bs on everyone s response.
Baby Acapulco,269,Absolutely the best chicken tortilla soup in town  And their lunch specials are awesome  almost all under  8.00. I got the soup and taco combo for  6.95  D
Baby Acapulco,270,A friend and myself went to this location and it was a horrible experience.  We walked into the restaurant and no one greeted us and we had to stand there staring at the waitress and bus boy for 5 minutes and even then neither of them said anything to us. We had to ask her if we seat ourselves or what. She said sharply   Just sit anywhere . So we sat and chips and salsa  which were the best part of the meal  were brought to us but our waitress  the same snappy girl that told us to sit anywhere  walked by our table 5 times and never took our drink order. We had to stop her to ask if she was even our waitress and even still we had to stop her from walking away and make her take our drink orders. I had a strawberry margarita and it was ok. My friends margarita on the rocks was awful  it tasted as if the sweet and sour had gone bad. It was gross.  I ordered the tortilla soup  decent  and the chicken fajita nachos... I ended up with chicken fajitas. They were cold and not the normal sizzling fajita that you think you ll get when you order fajitas. My friends vegetarian fajitas were atleast hot  but were not seasoned right. It didnt taste like mexican food. The rice was disgusting and so were the beans. The beans looked pale and cold and were not appetizing at all.  Overall I would not go to this location again and frankly I am unsure that I would try a Baby Acapulco again after this disaster.  We went to this location on 4 18 2012 at 8 29 pm and our server was Becca.
Baby Acapulco,271,Dhara is the bomb waitress   She recommended some great vegetarian options and was super informed and helpful.
Baby Acapulco,272,Yesterday was a cold and rainy day.  Perfect day for a bowl of steaming hot soup.  Baby A s tortilla soup gets all the raves around town.  It was okay.  The queso was the familiar Velveeta concoction. Chips were warm. Waitress was slow.  And the joint seemed a little dirty  like Gordon Ramsay could run his discriminating finger across the kitchen s overhead exhaust and draw back a very greasy digit. But the soup was okay.
Baby Acapulco,273,Pros  Lots of parking  good HH prices  free wifi Cons  The food.  The only thing holding this place back is its food. The drinks are well priced  especially during HH   the seating is plentiful  service is a little slow when full  but not bad.  Get a purple  rita  They re a little sweet and you re limited to two of them  but they re worth getting.  Drink and food specials during HH make this a good option if you wanna hang out   kick back and chat with some friends after work before moving onto something else. Live band karaoke on Thursday was also a lot of fun   If you gotta eat here  stick to the quesos  nachos and soups. The tortilla soup isn t bad here and is a good portion for the price. I just don t like anything with their ground taco meat  though their fajitas are alright.
Baby Acapulco,274,Love the food and drinks. Good customer service as well. Try a superman or the purple Rita.
Baby Acapulco,275,This used to be my favorite place to go after work to have a drink. I ve been coming to this location for almost 10 years. As I sat at the bar I d had ordered my usual. But this time I was asked to show identification. I was in shock as the bartender states that they have a new policy. To be severed you must show identification. I said but you ve know me for years. He d apologized and said yes but that s the company s new policy because someone at another store got caught by TABC serving alcohol to a minor. What  This has nothing to do with me. I have been a loyal patron to Baby A s for many year. Today will be the last time I will visit location. Baby A s needs to provide proper training to their employees and not use a blanket policy as such to require your regular customers and especially those who appear to be over 30 or 40 years of age to produce identification.
Baby Acapulco,276,Out of all the Baby A locations I prefer this one.  The food is average  customers can tend to be a bit rowdy even with families present but it s okay.  As everyone s all ready said  it s Tex-mex and nothing really stands out all that much.  I ve been here when bands have played in one bar area thats separated from the rest of place.
Baby Acapulco,277,Has your boss been riding you like you re Sea Biscuit   Do you wish you could just forget about all of that and have a nice evening   Would a nice  stiff drink help   Go to Baby A s and order the purple margarita.  It is made with Everclear  it s  surprise   purple  and it s tasty.  You feel it warming your throat as it goes down  and it is such a good feeling.  Make sure you eat some chips and salsa before you drink it though because you will need something in your stomach before it starts hitting you so quickly.  They have a limit of 2 on these  and it s with good reason.  After 1  you probably shouldn t be driving anyway.  If you order 2  your waiter or bartender will likely check to see if you have a designated driver.  If you try to order 3  you will only get away with it if you have a designated driver that your waiter has not served  if you ve ordered food  and if you re not completely smashed.  They know how strong these drinks are  and they don t want any liability on their hands for good reason.  Something that pairs well with the purple margarita are the nachos.  I like both the beef fajita and the shrimp nachos.  They come 6 to a plate  and they arrive with just enough  fixins  to spread between the 6.  Usually I ordered half shrimp and half beef fajita  and they charged me an extra  1.00.  It was worth it.    Their chicken tortilla soup is tasty too.  Their queso compuesto is quite nice too.  I had one friend order it with cheddar cheese.  It was stringy as would be expected  and she seemed to love it.  Frankly  I found it kind of gross to watch her messing with 2 foot long strings of cheese while eating her nachos.  To their credit  they accommodated her request.  Their beef fajitas are decent as well  so almost any dish you order with them will be acceptable.  I wasn t a big fan of their tamales.  Their chips and salsa are pretty good  and they re complimentary - as they should be   This location is one of the  nicer  locations throughout the Austin area.  I have been to all of them  and this one is my favorite.  It used to be a Bahama Breeze  so it had a much better start than the rest.  It can get pretty busy on the weekend evenings  but they do have a full bar you can blow some steam off at.  It was always well worth the drive to the best location.  Both dates I had at this place went quite well  but that is probably partially credit to the purple margarita   I went to the location in Pflugerville one time  and our friend s credit card was accidentally swapped with another patron s bill.  He got a rather large hold put on his card that lasted for several days  and it put him in a pretty big bind.  There wasn t much the restaurant could do after the swipe had already gone through  and ultimately the issue took care of itself.  To be fair  that could happen anywhere if a waiter is not paying attention.  It was just a big hassle for him.  No other complaints about that location other than the fact that it can get pretty busy.
Baby Acapulco,278,Great relaxing atmosphere. Never had a bad dish  love the purple margarita  The chicken in the quesadillas was cooked and seasoned perfectly. Wait staff isn t the most attentive or quick but always pleasant.
Baby Acapulco,279,Made the drive from South Austin just for Frozen Margarita s and salmon salad. First time John waited on us. He did a fantastic job  Very professional and paid close attention to our needs - Thanks John  Great job 
Baby Acapulco,280,A 3.5 if I could  but I will settle on 3.  We went once before to sit on the patio and drink margaritas and smoke.  They have delicious drinks  which are nice and strong for the price.  This time  we rolled in starving after a crazy imax experience and in need of some grub  with a secondary goal of ingesting tequila-y goodness.  It took our server a little while to get to the food ordering point  but once we did order  it came out quickly. I ordered the shrimp enchiladas  which were actually quite outstanding  best I ve had in town thus far  though they would have probably garnered a fourth star if it would have been crab and shrimp with the yummy cheesy sauce .  The fiance s big ass combo plate - he just summed it up as  standard fare .  Yummy  but nothing extraordinary.  The chips and salsa tasted really good...but I think it s just how hungry I was  not really that they were quality.  Go for the drinks  go if you want some decent tex mex  don t expect anything special  but after 2 visits  I d go again and give some other dishes a try.  I still have to try my normal standards - the taco enchilada combo plate  and the taco salad.
Baby Acapulco,281,Baby A s. I wanted to fall in love with you because of your name and the lucha libre on the menu. It was a very close thing. Your salsa bit back with a lovely zing. Your chips were warm and crispy.   Then the Queso con Shrimp came. First off  if you aren t saying Cheese with Shrimp  why the one Anglo word  What is wrong with Queso con Camerones  Is it too much to expect we Americans to learn more Spanish word  Then the dish itself.   The cheese was drippy and melty but when you got under that  the shrimp and onions were inundated with grease. You came with flour tortillas  points for asking me if I wanted corn or flour  but that didn t make up for the grease. I don t expect my queso to be greaso.   My dining companion ordered a wet burrito and said it was very good. My chicken fajitas were a very small portion. And the chicken didn t look like it had been cooked for fajitas. More like a grilled breast that had been sliced up then mixed in with the lovely grilled onions and green peppers. Honestly  I thought it was cold and touched it to make sure it was hot before I ate it.  The sides were tiny. Is it going to kill you to give enough sour cream and guacamole for more than one fajita  And three tortillas  I was not thrilled by my meal overall. Plus I had to remind my wait that I was out of tea--twice. And ask for more sweetner because there were only 2 packets on the table.  Dessert was great. My friend had the sopapillas and ate them all up. I had flan. That flan about made up for the fajitas. Should have stuck to Ernestine Ulmer s philosophy.  Life is uncertain. Eat dessert first.   So  sadly  it wasn t a great first date  Baby A. I ll probably go back though. I m a sucker for lucha libre references.
Baby Acapulco,282,I m usually a fan of Baby A s but this time was terrible.  Right off the bat the hostess ask if I was my friends mom.  Im not that old.  Totally offended me.  Second  the waiter rushed us and we received terrible chips for our chips and salsa.  Bottom of the barrel chips.  After our food came out the taco salad did not have meat in it and had to be sent back.  The quesadillas that my son ordered came with lettuce  tomatos and sour cream which I specified that he did not want.  The only good thing on this visit were the drinks.  I ll make sure not to come back to Baby A s....ever.
Baby Acapulco,283,Went here for drinks with friends and sat outside on the patio. The service was a little slow and the food didn t look too spectacular  but Baby A s is definately worth going to for the margaritas  It has an extensive margartia menu. The purple margarita was great  but my favorite was the prickly pear   If you have time to wait and are in the mood for margaritas  I would definately visit 
Baby Acapulco,284,Ricardo and Jaime are the best bartenders in Austin  They re fast  fun  and personable. We love coming here  Best margarita in town
Baby Acapulco,285,This is me and my boyfriends favorite and go to restaurant. We ve been here over 20 times and have always had great service and food. The tortilla soup is the best you will ever have and is very big in portion. The Margs are also to die for  my favorite being the strawberry and mango. Love love love baby As and especially this location and staff.
Baby Acapulco,286,Sat on the patio  a little slow to get seated but service on the patio was great.  Scotty does a fantastic job  just ate chips and salsa and some queso.  All were very good.  Girlfriend loved the purple margarita.
Baby Acapulco,287,If I could give less than 1 star - I would  Let me explain. My mother and I went twice. The first time was okay  our waiter disappeared and our drinks ran out which for two ex-servers is a big red flag but on a scale of one to ten  NOT the worst thing that could happen. Food is good  drinks were pretty good  we even liked the disappearing server to an extent.  The second time we went  again  drinks were good  food was good  service was even pretty good  However.  1 hour after my mother used her credit card to pay for our food  we paid in cash the first time   my mother s card numbers were being used.  The thief who used her card charged over FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS since our dinner on 12 3 16.  The CREDIT CARD COMPANY is saying that it was the purchase at Baby A s where it got stolen. When we called the corporate office number for Baby A s  they blew my mother off and did not care.  Very very very disappointed in this  as most companies upon hearing there is even a chance of credit card fraud you d think would jump to make up for any problems. I was going to try and convince my mother to try a different location  as there are several in Austin  but I think we ll go with a whole new restaurant chain instead  due to the handling of this situation.
Baby Acapulco,288,I gave this place 2 stars because service was great. I read reviews about this place and only decided to try it because of the good reviews about the drinks. That was my first and last time unfortunately the margaritas are gross. It tasted like the cheapest tequila ever made. If you re too drunk to care then I would recommend this place other than that I wouldn t dine here. I was disappointed and the only good thing here was friendly staff.
Baby Acapulco,289,Ricardo and Jamie are so way fab   Best costumer service evs. My friends and I walk in and they welcome us with a smile and great service - it s like we re sitting on the pack porch 
Baby Acapulco,290,Skylar is the best server ever. Always quick and friendly. Always remembers what we order. And has a great smile.
Baby Acapulco,291,Ate here tonight with a party of 5 and a child.   Here s the good and bad   Good   friendly waiter  delicious mango margaritas  Bad   nachos...stale chips  nasty-tasting beef  seafood enchiladas--couldn t eat them.  no dressing on salad  asked for Italian vinaigrette which never came  asked for no salt  glass came with salt  asked for no croutons on the salad  gluten sensitivity   salad came with croutons  slow service  although Daryl was very cheerful  Overall  it was not a good time.  Management  comped  the seafood enchiladas.  We all were disappointed in the food and somewhat in the service.  We won t go back unless it s for one of the mango margaritas ONLY.
Baby Acapulco,292,Been going to Baby Acapulco since 1995 and was discusted with the food quality my last outing. All the sauces served came from either a can or a bottle  non of the sauces were restaurant made. When I go to a restaurant I expect freshly made sauces and salsas  not from a can. If I wanted can salsas and sauces I would pay less than half the price and go to a fast food restaurant. Pretty disgusting.  I can do to Taco Cabana or many other ma pa restaurants who serve freshly made sauces with every dish.
Baby Acapulco,293,One Purple Marg down  next time going for two    The limit . Place looks like it would be fun to come on a weekend night. The food was good as well had the fajitas for two and they tasted like fajitas.
Baby Acapulco,294,Mirian aka mimi was just the most amazing waitress the other night  Not only did she go above and beyond for my table but also assisted me in picking out a gluten free option for my child. Will be going again
Baby Acapulco,295,The Barton Springs location is worth 5 stars  this location is just different.. Service  food  and drinks all not as good as the other location.
Baby Acapulco,296,First time at this location. Been to every other location in Austin. Over all this place was a total cluster f  k. Poorly managed.  Ghetto  is the best word I can think of and this applies to all their locations. The vast variety of margarita drink choices is the only redeeming quality about this place. The two drink limit is pretty lame. I had one purple margarita and one regular and they wouldn t let me have any other margaritas. The way they told me this was completely humiliating and embarrassing. I won t be going back to any of their locations.
Baby Acapulco,297,Lots old people     Sing karaoke no less.   Maybe it s just me but I think it s a place where 40  single divorced people get their groove on.   Anyhow  I liked my fish tacos.  Was it the best    No.... but I liked mhy fish tacos  -D
Baby Acapulco,298,Baby A s has two things that make it great  sour cream chicken enchiladas  amp  the purple rita. Be sure to try the stuffed jalapenos  they re cruncy and superb  the wait staff is speedy  friendly and playful. the scene is casual  amp  trendy. This isn t my fave tex-mex in atx but it rivals chuy s.
Baby Acapulco,299,Came to this location tonight for drinks with my family. We live in Round Rock  but wanted to do something different and check out the live band situation. Grabbed a drink at the bar and were so impressed with how welcoming Bobby was with us - treated us like regulars  We will definitely make the drive to come back in the future  Please ask for Bobby if you sit at the bar 
Baby Acapulco,300,My Favorite restaurant in Stonelake  Best Mexican food for miles  The patio is one of the best parts.  Very chill with lots of trees and cool lights.  Even live music on the weekend nights.  You can t go wrong 
Baby Acapulco,301, 1  Ditto Nickie G. on those purple margaritas.  Holy freaking cow  amazing.  Take note to drive carpool with people who are not drinking purple margaritas.  2  Okay fish tacos -- yums for fried goodness  but a thumbs down  not a huge thumbs down  but one nonetheless  for having a small portion of fried nuggets.  Again  I like a lot of meat  here  fish  so the maybe 4-5 fish nugget-lets were not really enough for me.  The cabbage slaw had more of the red-kind that s a bit more bitter than my liking  but all of it was fresh  Sauce was yummy  too.  And the bite of the hubs  fajitas that I had  delish.   3  They ve got a sitdown pacman 80 s videogame machine.  Rockin. But again  to give this review its proper accord  please keep in mind that I was way into  1.  Whew  those purple margaritas...
Baby Acapulco,302,Went here with a friend for drinks and dinner  and had a great time...with my friend. Food drink-wise  the evening was a little below par. I always enjoy queso  and I m not snobby about it  so that was tasty. My main entree was alright  but definitely could tell it was beginning to cool down as it arrived.  Our service wasn t great - he didn t pay attention to my order  failing to substitute an item on the plate. I also didn t get the impression he wanted to be there. In addition  they had a band start up toward the end of our meal  which was fun  but WAY too loud. It became hard to talk  and frustrating to guests.  I may go back here for drinks  but honestly  I feel there are betting options in the area. Best thing about the night  pineapple margarita.
Baby Acapulco,303,Ceviche - Purples - corn tortillas  Baby A s has great tex-mex and an even better patio. I have no idea what the inside looks like because we always sit outside. We have gone every Friday for Lent and will make it part of our routine for sure.
Baby Acapulco,304,I didn t get a chance to check in here on Sunday as it was date night so I didn t have my phone. We spent our day at Barton Springs Pool and had passed by here before on our way home. It looked like a cute place to try  we love patio seating  So once again we were on our way home  amp  pulled a u turn to check it out. We were greeted promptly  amp  say outside. Our server came over a few minutes later as he seemed very busy but was very friendly when he got the chance to chat. We didn t have a big appetite as we were more in the market for drinks  mom dad date night . There was a picture of a watermelon margarita that my other half couldn t pass up  they had him at watermelon... I had a tropical margarita flight... it was just what momma needed- they DON T short you on the alcohol  Strong  amp  yummy    I did order a little snack of wings  half  amp  half. After 2 rounds of drinks our server asked if we wanted to order any food... wait  I did. He then rushed away and put in the order and came back with some queso to munch on while we waited. I did mention that he seemed very busy right  We were not upset as we were enjoying being out and having some alone time. The wings came out shortly after  amp  were tasty. They had a perfect crunchy outside  amp  great flavor. Our time came to and end and we will definitely go back  maybe take some friends next time.
Baby Acapulco,305,Great place  Purple margaritas are the way to go.... I ALWAYS sit at the bar. Eddie seems to be there most of the time and is always fast and friendly. Liz and Ricky have waited on me several times as well and are quick to come by and chat even when they aren t waiting on me. Very welcoming place and it has turned into our go to spot at least once a week
Baby Acapulco,306,This was more about service. Yesterday.  Wednesday friend and I were out running around.  Saw an open sign lit up in windows facing movie theater. Went inside.  So many people walked past us ignoring us. Finally I start waving hello do you see us   Someone came up and said for us to have a seat they aren t open. I mentioned the sign being on and front doors opened. Whatever.service. Our server was ok. After we paid he didn t come back. We were not campers. But wanted to finish my tea and have a refill. Never came back.  We also kept making sure no one was waiting for a table .
Baby Acapulco,307,Not a bad place to have a seat  eat some salsa and enjoy the weather on the patio while it s not 110  outside.   D  Of course  that being stated  if you DO sit outside  be patient with your waitstaff around the lunch hour  they ve a lot of running around to do.
Baby Acapulco,308,I have never enjoyed Baby A s. It had been YEARS since I had been. My friend was having a birthday there so I would not have gone if it wasn t for that. We had a large party  probably 20 people  so I understand that things are going to take longer but the waiter was just OK while we were ordering and eating. We didn t always get the extra things we asked for and I actually got up and got the tea pitcher from the server station to refill our glasses. After we got our checks and paid the waiter HOVERED around our table to pick up the receipts  I finally gathered them up and gave them to him so he would stop. There was a group of 5 of us that stuck around and would have been happy to spend more money but our waiter was probably home and in bed by then. We were basically ignored and we would have to run people down to ask for drinks from the bar. Out of everything we asked for we ended up with one drink which they immediately brought the check for. I had the stuffed avocado and it was good but my partner had the seafood pasta and he said there was 3 pieces of seafood at the most. He was seriously disappointed.  Something else that p  amp     me off was that they included the tip in the tab. I get it  I really do but the service sucked.
Baby Acapulco,309,Low quality food  high priced drinks  and the harassed my blind friend when she brought her guide dog in  but soehow when I arrived and asked if they had seen a table of blind individuals said they hadn t seen any blind people all night.
Baby Acapulco,310,Great service from the bartenders Ricky has excellent customer service.  Very friendly 
Baby Acapulco,311,This restaurant has the worst service. We visit weekly to listen to the bands and usually have 1 margarita each. We sit on the chairs by the band but are always told they won t serve that area so we go to the bar.  When we go to the bar they won t serve us because we are sitting in the chairs by the band.  Tonight we sat on the deck and ordered 2 frozen margaritas without salt and queso.  We got 2 margaritas with salt and no queso. I know the waiter heard us because he asked if we wanted a small queso.
Baby Acapulco,312,This place is the worst. I m new to this place and never ate here but this surely will be my last time. I came to visit my cousin down here in Austin and we wanted to eat somewhere close so we chose this place because it s right next to our hotel. When we went inside they told us the wait time would be 7 55 pm. We went outside to wait and about 3 mins later a waiter or manager  I forgot  came and said that a party chose to sit where we were sitting. So we said ok and got up and went inside and waited till it hit 8 00 pm. My cousin went and asked a waiter why it was taking so long to get a table. Then the manager came and interrupted her and asked what s the problem. She asked if why it was taking so long to get a table. The manager points at a clean table w  nothing on it and says  we have to clean it. Then she says why can t we eat outside where we were first sitting because there was no party there. He says  no and they had to move because the person playing the guitar couldn t be heard and they had to move places. She says something else then walks off but then the manager follows her and comes to us and says is there a problem. We say we been waiting since 7 30 and said that we would have a table by 7 55. He then says it s 8 05 then my cousins interrupts and says it s actually 8 10. He then says what can t wait the 10 extra mins. Then he started calling my cousin rude and something else that was rude. So then her mother starts to defend her daughter. He then says he ain t gonna serve us because he was scared that we were going to fight w  the waiter even though they were nicer then him. Then we said that he attempted to make us leave and make us drive about 7 miles away. He then says that he never asked us to leave but now we do. Now this made me angry I was about to get involved but we left because all we were doing was wasting time w  this guy. If I could rate lower I would. Never ever coming back to a place like this that treats there customers like there nothing and waste your time. And we have the guys name and will be calling corporate because we were very missed treated by y all
Baby Acapulco,313,I love this place for a relaxed  laid back Friday night after work with friends or Co-workers. Enjoy live bands on the patio and sip on a variety of their famous margaritas and devour greasy goodness Mexican food. Not the highest quality  but this place is all about the atmosphere.  Yes  that s what it is and I really like it for what it is. The purple passion is their famous margarita with a limit of two  but all you need is one 
Baby Acapulco,314,Chips and salsa and ritas are great   We ordered the appetizer plate and the baby changa and it was disappointing.  Highly recommend visiting for happy hour  dollar off all ritas .
Baby Acapulco,315,We have not been here in years. All around mediocre. Food and service. It is a large restaurant  so you do not feel crowded  but there is nothing special here. Salsa - just not up to par for a Tex-Mex restaurant. Appetizer plate - messy presentation. Everything seems straight out of the freezer - just heat and eat. Queso - no character or taste of real cheese. Disappointing.
Baby Acapulco,316,I had been to this location several times in the past and love the huge outdoor patio. Not sure what the heck happened to this place since I was there several years ago but clearly has gone downhill. We arrived and walked in via the back patio area. There was a small table to the side with menus and there were many tables open on the patio so we assumed we were to just wait there for a hostess to either take our name  seat us  or give us some type of direction. We stood there for a good 5 minutes with many staff just walking right past us. Finally someone who worked there said  You need to go to the hostess stand inside to get on a wait list.  Ok. Would have been nice to know 5 minutes ago or have a sign stating that but hey  whatever so inside we went. We then stand inside at hostess stand. No one is there to take our name or put us on a wait list. Finally a guy comes over who clearly is flustered. He takes our name and give us an automated buzzer then tell us will be  about a 20-30 minute wait for the patio.  No problem. So we sit. After about 50 minutes and being ready to just get up and leave at this point after watching multiple other people come over to complain about seating issues our buzzer goes off. We go up to hostess stand where the guy then tells us to wait because  he is going to seat a group of us all at once.  So we wait  a group of about 3 other parties walk up and we then all file into formation like a huge awkward cattle herd through the restaurant while he leads us all to separate tables. Did I mention it was awkward  Because it was. We finally sit down and before our waitress even hands us our menu she asks us what we want to drink  I pause for a split second and very nicely say   I may need just a quick second to look at the drinks  The waitress then ROLLED HER EYES at me  huffs  and says   I ll be back  and storms off. Wow. What a great attitude for working in the service industry   sarcasm  So we then waited patiently for 5 minutes  10 minutes  15 minutes while watching her go to every table except ours. At this point she was making it obvious she wasn t going to come back to our table. Again at this point we are ready to just get up and walk out. Another waitress after about 20 minutes from the other one walking off who clearly had seen what was happening finally came over and said  has someone helped you yet   I explained I had told our waitress I may need a quick second to decide on a drink but that was about 20 minutes ago. She kind of gave us a look and and a nod as if to be like  oh yeah  her  and said   I will go ahead and take care of you guys table.  She was great and honestly the most friendly person who helped us while there. The food on the other hand was not great. I got chicken fajitas that didn t even taste like they were seasoned and my husbands rice was cold and stale tasting. Overall we spent about  75 there only to get bad food and bad attitude from the majority of the staff. It s a shame because the location has a lot to offer but we definitely learned our lesson this time and won t ever be back. And the eye-rolling waitress may want to find another career that doesn t depend on tips or require having any basic social skills.
Baby Acapulco,317,The day we almost ordered Pizza while waiting to be seated at this restaurant   Called day before and day of asking if this restaurant took reservations or call ahead seating... I was informed it was  first come first serve upon arrival . We arrived with our party of 10 and were told 1 - it would be an hour wait 2 - they have plenty of tables but not enough servers  as we watch one of who knows how many managers milll around joking  3- we stated too bad you don t make reservations and they stated  wait do you have a reservation    WHAT   You make reservations    No uh yes ...it s up to the Manager  4- an hour and a half comes and goes and we have yet to be seated but see 2 larger parties being seated before us. My 6 year old started crying the pity tortilla chips and water came out. We realize that they keep seating smaller parties and they  have no intention of seating us. We are now contemplating ordering Dominoes pizza to be delivered in the waiting area while we wait.
Baby Acapulco,318,So disappointed. Went in at 3 today  Saturday  6-3-17  to have lunch before going to the movies and there was no one at the host hostess stand. Waited for about 8 minutes and no one even came or acknowledged our presence. Bartender lady saw us  but she was busy at the bar. The place wasn t busy at all. So just left the restaurant. Hope to come back and get better service.
Baby Acapulco,319,Incredible experience and food  Elizabeth Gibbs and Diego Dias did a wonderful job helping us at the bar. These guys deserve raises     GREAT 
Baby Acapulco,320,We had the best time  My boyfriend and I went on a Saturday evening before going to see a movie. We were seated immediately and the bartenders Elizabeth Gibbs and Diego Dias were with us right away. Despite being incredibly busy they were both very attentive and fun to talk to     Not once did they let our drinks get low  kudos to Baby A s for having such fantastic staff    
Baby Acapulco,321,Well    I just tried my second Baby A location  Really pretty patio  totally different vibe than downtown    Thank you again for yummy food and fabulous Margaritas     I would like to say I was there on Cinco De Mayo  and saw the patio interaction as shared in a previous review. The manager was certainly trying to visit all the tables  and welcome the guests. She also was a little more attentive if there were any issues voiced. My party of 4 adults were a little concerned with how long our food was taking  the manager on that day checked back with us several times. She wanted to keep the feel that our needs were heard and that our experience was turning out to be better than worse. THANK YOU  She offered the statement...  please be sure to save some room for dessert...to top of your meal....  she stated also it would be her pleasure to bring it...on the house   There was no doubt in our mind she was VERY guest experience oriented...THANK YOU     By the time our afternoon ended  our appetite was satisfied  we felt like we have a new friend...BABY A overall. There was no doubt in our mind that THAT manager would try to fix anything if there was a problem  and if next visit there is no problem...we have no doubt She will come and chat n welcome us and CHECK ON US throughout our visit. How could anything get much better than knowing we are in great hands. Thank you very much....I know I will refer more people there because I can be sure they will also be well taken care of  We WILL again return VERY SOON to see our friends at Baby Acapulco s.
Baby Acapulco,322,I have been a loyal customer of Baby A s since it first opened.  During that time the business has waxed and waned and the food has varied from good to bad.  We have had great experiences and great food and have endured untrained waiters  bad food  cold food and have even seen a rat run across the room at the Stone Lake location.  A lot of history.  During the last couple of years things seemed to be improving  but the last couple of months it has been a different story. During our last visit the waiters and managers seemed distraught and distracted.  Our food was cold when served.  The kitchen at the Stone Lake location is open to parts of the restaurant and bar.  We observed two separate cooks removing our food from the microwave and testing the temperature with their BARE FINGERS.  Not once  but twice   When we pointed this out  we were told the cooks were new.  Nothing else was offered except the check.
Baby Acapulco,323,Let me start by saying I love Baby A s but I never been to this location. It s Cinco de Mayo which I had seen flyers a week ago advertising for the event. Well today we had to wait two hours for a table  which I expected and was not mad . When we where finally seated it took 45 mins for a drink order. Then  there here three adults and one child  when our food was brought they didn t have the kids meal. Heard a story from the waiter about how they had a bigger turn out then expected and that they had to close seating people because the cooks  all four of them  had 50 orders....anyways we are still here. We arrived at 5 pm and it 10 and we are still waiting for the kids meal  Never again   So an update on the rest of our evening... Service was very slow our waitress was not attending to our table  we had to ask another waiter passing by for silverware and soft drink refills after asking our waitress and never receiving them. We requested to speak to the manager on multiple occasions however no one came. Finally  we asked the waitress if it was OK to just have a pizza delivered  lol  so we could feed the child who never received her food. One would think she would understand we were not very happy at that point still not having received a kids meal or a refill on chips and salsa to try to hold her over.   No one came around to clear off the tables or the empty glasses after they where empty then suddenly I noticed someone picking up all the glasses  leaving the dirty plates mind you  that were left on all the tables I figured the bar had run out of clean glasses and I was right because we ordered a second round of drinks that came in smaller cups.  One person at our table pointed that out to our waitress who s response was  that is a cup and amount that we were given  and yes they were the same price for a smaller portion. Since she still had her original cup she poured the one just received into the other cup in front of the waitress and asked for a manager because it was clearly not the same amount  and again still no one came. The reason why we chose that restaurant because it was easy access to the rest of our kids after they got out of sports practice so another parent and about five other girls met us. By that time service was much faster they receive their food and we asked for our checks. My check was for my entr e and two drinks both regular reprice although one drink was clearly a half size order. The lady who complained about the drinks size at our table received a full price drink and one that was half off  mind you we both ordered the exact same drinks and we both sat at the exact same table  at this point I just wanted to pay for my tab because I was very frustrated. At this point it was the first time that I myself complaint and asked to speak to a manager because I didn t understand why I was being charged more. However Just wanted to leave so I handed the waitress my credit card and decided not to tip at this point. We paid our bill and was in the parking lot when someone tapped me on my shoulder  it was the manager telling me that I insulted her waitress. I quickly told her that I was insulted at their service and mainly at her for not trying to make it right. I did not blame the waitress I blamed the management and that I could not understand that only now she is going out of her way to address the issue because I did not tip yet our service was terrible and we asked for her many times and there was no apologies or attempts to make the service better. The debacle with the kids meal could ve at least been made a little better by bringing the child something to snack on. The altercation ended with her telling me to never come back to her restaurant again which my immediate reaction was to tell her that I had already made up my mind to never come back to this restaurant again and tell everybody I know about my terrible experience.   Now if I could teach the manager one lesson it s that if  someone ask to speak to a manager that s probably what they want to happen. Secondly  you tip off the service it s not necessarily a requirement I was required to pay my bill which I did and I quietly left however the manager followed me into the parking lot which is never OK I kind of feel personally attacked. I did not and dine or refuse to pay so I should ve never been confronted in the parking lot.
Baby Acapulco,324,So bad.  Like why is this place so so SO BAD      It s a relic but a horrible  like no one ever talks about and when you get here  you ll see why it s so bad. Life is too short  drive on my friend....Manuels is a block away. You remember Weiner s    This is the Weiner s of Tex-Mex.  We are too close to Mexico for being THIS BAD.  It s embarrassing. I got served a margarita on the rocks that was mostly water. Couldn t find the waiter for 20 mins so I take it to the bar myself. Bartender says I have to talk to the waiter. Lemme get this right. The guy who makes a bad drink won t make a new one until I talk to the guy who brought it to me.  Dafk   On top of an hour and a half wait to be seated  a dirty high chair  no water or chip amp salsa for over 45mins. Then the manger comes by and asks if she can do anything else. My reply...food. I want to order food.  The whole reason anyone goes to a restaurant to eat.  Head shaking.  How bad does this restaurant have to be to mess up the one job they have   When our food came  the shrimp was rubber and dry. Nothing was good.  Bill comes  they actually tried to charge an extra drink for the bad margarita.  Told them to take that off and that there should be a comp for the whole terrible experience.  Nope nothing.  What a sad day to see this place become the worst tragedy.
Baby Acapulco,325,First time there and it was great  Food was delicious and our server John R. was excellent  He was on top of everything  we were never waiting on him  he was running around making sure all his tables were taken care of. Not only was there great food and service but also some delicious margaritas and all for a good price 
Baby Acapulco,326,Perfect evening to sit on the patio and be serenaded by our waiter  Octavio  I want him as our waiter from now on. Very passionate about his love for music. Loved it 
Baby Acapulco,327,Terrible terrible food. The place was filthy  and the service was horrendous. Our server took forever to take our drink orders and bring us our food. The food was bland and the tacos were stale.  Thankfully the margarita was strong enough so I could at least eat the food.  Never going back.
Baby Acapulco,328,Service in here is horrible  They take forever to take your order and to bring your food  drinks  water  even your check. I live their margaritas but other than that I won t be here for anything else. Sucks because I love this place  the decoration  environment and food but the service completely destroys the mood.
Baby Acapulco,329,Had a large party on the night of Feb. 2nd Thur and had Jordan as our waitress. I had to share because I ve never had what I called Perfect service until her. She was on the ball  at tentative  and her customer service was exceptional.  I had to tell the manager what a great experience we had. Great food  atmosphere   and exceptional service.
Baby Acapulco,330,Don t know why the rating here is so low  We ve been there the past 2 Saturdays and it s so fun  Live music.  Been 2 different cover bands each time.  Very entertaining.  Husband got several different kinds of margaritas.  Seemed to enjoy them. I m pregnant so I enjoyed virgin coconut daiquiris. Very yummy. Food is okay.  Typical tex mex in my opinion.  We go more for the atmosphere.  It s so fun  And our waiters have been really nice and helpful each time
Baby Acapulco,331,Unfortunately I will not be returning back to this establishment. Really considering reporting Baby A Stonelake  to the BBB and health department. We just left about 10 minutes ago. My husband and I were seated. The waitress greeted us right away which was great. We ordered our appetizer and drinks. The food and drinks came out promptly to the table. This is where the one star rating comes in. As I picked up my drink to take a sip I look down at the table  and see a roach..yes a ROACH staring at me like I interrupted his meal and I need to move to another table. I immediately notified the waitress  she grabbed a napkin snatched up the roach and threw the napkin away she came back to the table  and apologized and stated that the manager would be out to speak to us. About five minutes later the waitress returns with no manager present. She asked if we wanted the food taken away  no we want to still eat it  yes take this food away..yuck   I got up and told her that we re leaving. I have been to this location several times  but that is the last time I will step foot in there again. I probably wouldn t have written this review if the manager would came out and apologized or at least showed his or her face.
Baby Acapulco,332,My husband and I decided to go out for a drink on 07 10 2015 a little later than usual to beat the crowds.  He was in the mood for a frozen margarita  so we decided to go to Baby A s because it was close to the house and they have a patio.  I would have given them 5 stars if we were actually able to sit out there  but it was late so they were already closing it for the night.  We decided to stay and go inside since we were already there.  Our bartender was really nice and had a good since of humor.  My husband had the purple margarita and I had a strawberry Mexican one.  It was good and not too strong for me as I am a lightweight when it comes to the drinks.  My husband said that his was good also.  The chips were awesome and the salsa was very good as well.  Again  the only negative I can give them for this night was no access to the patio the one time I really wanted to sit out there   .  But overall it was a positive experience and I know now if I want to sit on the patio I need to arrive a little earlier.
Baby Acapulco,333,Waited 25 minutes for a waitress 45 minutes for a refill that had a straw wrapper in it and had to send my food back because it came out wrong. Save some time and money and go someplace else
Baby Acapulco,334,We started going to Baby A s in  89 at Barton Creek and have been to every location in Austin numerous times. We now live closer to Stonelake and have been going mostly to that one  since they opened it. You may not find extreme gormet food  which means high prices  but good solid basic Mexican food  which we can afford to go once or twice a week and have super margaritas and half price appetizers and not break the bank. Never had an expereience with any of the staff that wasn t positive and helpful  and when we take the whole family  we can afford it  with free drink refills. Great margaritas  prices  and atmosphere.
Baby Acapulco,335,Came to town for a meeting and was in the hotel next door.  Didn t really want to drive so I walked over for take out. The service was great.  The young lady behind the bar was friendly and gracious.  I had substituted this and that and although I don t think she was supposed to do certain things  she assured me she would take care of whatever I wanted.  I got my food quickly and walked back to the hotel.  It was maybe 100 yards away.  I got back to my room and the food was still very hot.  It was great.  I was very satisfied with my choice 
Baby Acapulco,336,Some of the best Mexican food I have ever had  and DEFINITELY order the Purple Margarita   
Baby Acapulco,337,The only reason I even went here was because my future in-laws wanted to go. I would not have picked this place when in Austin. Service was good enough  but when I got my beer  there was a plastic knob in it. When I informed the waitress  she brought the manager     over to inspect it. Not sure why this was necessary  she could have just taken it back and shown him in private. But anyway  my beer was not comped. I was served another one and only charged for one beer. Maybe good service has spoiled me  but usually when something isn t right through no fault of your own  you get someone comped to make up for the unpleasantness. I guess Baby Acapulco has yet to learn this great customer service tool. I ordered a chicken dish with tomatoes  cheese and mushrooms. It was very good.
Baby Acapulco,338,Good bar tenders and margaritas. Food is average but cheap. Good place for happy hour.
Baby Acapulco,339,Took my husband for his first visit to Baby A s. We both were happy with our experience. I got their tortilla soup with extra cilantro. He got chalupas  I think . I love their chips. The room we sat in  to the right when you walk in  rubbed me the wrong way....not sure why. Also  our waitress was very friendly but was MIA after dropping off our food. Should have taken her up in her offer for extra napkins....
Baby Acapulco,340,After a long day of flying  Baby A s had exactly what I needed. Their chicken enchiladas with verde sauce were on point. I love a restaurant with a gluten free menu 
Baby Acapulco,341,I think my experience could ve gone better. The waitress there wasn t so great. She was nice and everything but wasn t very organized. I could tell she was really trying  but it just wasn t very good.  The food was 4 1 2 stars out of five. But did take a little while because the waitress I think was new or something.   Although I enjoyed the food  it s a little too pricy for what you get is what I think. This place needs improvement before I come over to this place again but  I kinda liked it.
Baby Acapulco,342,Ordered fajitas for take-out  everything was there except the tortillas. Steak didnt look so tasty so i just ate the rice  amp  beans it came with instead of driving all the way back for the tortillas.. rice  amp  beans were good  but i was expecting to eat delicious fajitas so i was still a bit bummed no matter how good the rice  amp  beans were  Salsa was ok. pretty hot for mild  thats what we asked for anyways not sure thats what we got.. they did hook us up with a huge bag or tortilla chips.. maybe i was suppose to use those  tortillas  for my fajitas  Anywhooo id probably be willing to try the place again if i was in Austin alot but since im not i ll probably be eating else where next time i drive through.
Baby Acapulco,343,It would be nice if that Clara lady told you guys how much she gives servers as a vacation pay after working two years for her company   Zero   My son worked there for two years and received nothing  Its a motherly instinct to react  my son was a awsome server and to be treated like nothing really upsets me. Eating here you are supporting this kind of treatment  its a shame that a family restaurant will treat my family this way. Shame on you  I want everyone to read this and understand what I feel. Answer that Clara 
Baby Acapulco,344,I have a love hate relationship with this place.   When it s good   it s VERY good   when it s not....it s HORRIBLE .    In my opinion  which is very subjective I know..   this place has the best chips and salsa in the Austin area.     I went in with my entire family this Sunday morning to eat.   The website says they open at 11AM.   OK   wouldn t that mean that they SHOULD be able to feed   serve somebody AT 11 AM    or shortly after that..    There was probably a grand total of 20 people or less in the restaurant    including 7 of us..   and it took FOR-EV-ER to get our food.   which was straight forward   with nothing exotic   or strange requests.    The queso was lukewarm and jelly-like   by the time the meal arrived   everything was if it had sit on a shelf for a while   lukewarm at best.    The puffy tacos   which we normally really like  were NOT very good....the chile relleno was not worth eating   and it was overall a BAD meal   like something they really didn t have time to cook.      If you say you open at 11AM   you should be READY to go at 11 AM  
Baby Acapulco,345,Holy yuck  You live in Texas where there are a million other options for Tex Mex... Use them  Bland food  sad queso  and bad service.
Baby Acapulco,346,This was an absolutely awful place. I m not that picky with my food  but I ended up going to Wendy s after this and having a burger because I was still hungry  and needed something better to push it down with  sad    I ll start with the entrance. It was barren and we waited 5 minutes for someone to even show up to seat us. Once seated  the waitress was slow. She wasn t terrible  just nothing to tip extra for. The chips were flavorless and the salsa was odd. The margarita was okay  nothing great  but worth the money.  The entree is what caused the 1 star rating. I got the stuffed avocado. I knew it wouldn t be as good as Trudy s  but I expected something half decent. Well  it was grotesque. On my first bite  I got some soggy basil leaves  I think they were   stuck in my teeth. On the second bite  I bit into something hard and sharp and yanked out two skinny chicken  I hope  bones from my teeth. Appetite LOST. I tried the beans  they smelled rancid and tasted worse. The rice was flavorless.  I ended up eating half of it and mushing the rest of it around in my beans til I couldn t look at it anymore.   Oh well  back to Trudy s and Chuy s.
Baby Acapulco,347,Worst experience I have ever had at a restaurant. The food is not fresh.. I had a hamburger...tasted very gamey... Just not good at all. Probably a frozen burger. I would think twice before coming to this restaurant.
Baby Acapulco,348,Food is questionable. Not worth trying. Service is terrible. Sign says wait to be seated but no one comes to seat you. Decided to seat myself at the bar and still had to wave down the bartender to get service. Plus it was not even busy. The only thing that was great were the drinks.
Baby Acapulco,349,Worst. Restaurant. Ever. Don t waste your time or money on this hellish pit of abysmal service and food that makes one yearn for taco bell... If you do get trapped or ticked into going  avoid the waitress that looks  and acts  like Kitty from Arrested Development. She s the ditziest  most forgetful  rude  just plain hating her job kind of waitress you could imagine. Three tortillas for a double order of  sizzling  fajitas which came out looking microwaved on a lukewarm skillet  and tasted like SHIT  Heb pre bagged fajita meat is better  -p  30 minutes to get friggin water    Screwing up everyones checks  trying to get an inflated gratuity  since its included   I could go on and on... Just avoid it at all costs if you have a mouth and brain that work.
Baby Acapulco,350,I agree with my friend  Jason E. s review of our visit yesterday  and was so disappointed.  the waiter was clearly not happy and not responsive.  I didn t know the situation  if they had him spread too thin with too many tables  etc.  Everything we asked for was a LONG wait  and the cheese enchiladas are  Meh .  The manager was a very kind lady  but Chapstick that they got free from a tequila vendor did not remedy the situation.
Baby Acapulco,351,This place is GARBAGE  and if you give this place more than 1 star you have the pallet and the brains of a horses ass. DONE.
Baby Acapulco,352,Had a great margarita and a great time   Our server John  was great-very friendly and knowledgeable for our visit in Austin... And willing to put up with our silliness  Highly recommend to anyone who is looking for a casual dining experience.
Baby Acapulco,353,I used to go to this Baby A s location ALL the time. They had great service  food and music up until the start of this year. The management now needs to be replaced with competent people.. All of the good servers have left and the food is getting cheaper. This past Saturday they cancelled the band for  bad weather . There was zero rain all day Saturday and almost clear by the time the sun had set. This is the second Saturday in the past month where they have cancelled the music  number 1 reason anyone goes . Maybe they can t afford to pay the band. I don t know what is going on but the restaurant looked like someone had died this Saturday. I will NOT be returning to this location EVER.
Baby Acapulco,354,I meet a group of my friends here monthly and we are treated pretty badly.  The last time I was there I ordered queso and asked for some fresh nachos THREE times to go with my queso   By the time the nachos arrived my queso had curdled.  I asked them then to replace my queso.  From now on  I don t believe I will be ordering food from them.  They re generally pretty uncrowded  so meeting up with a group is rather easy and you can get seated quickly.
Baby Acapulco,355,Where to start   Weekday night  only moderately crowded  but service was slow  surly waiter kept having to be asked for water  napkins.  The chips tasted stale and the salsa had a metallic taste to it.  No one at the table enjoyed their food.  Don t get the fish sliders   They had the nerve to bring out little dry buns with a rectangle fish stick   Not even real fish   and  industrial fries that were undercooked.  Not worth the price.  Same for the other diners.  Not going back.  Ever.
Baby Acapulco,356,I ve always enjoyed Baby A s  even though on occasion I ve had to send a dish back to be reheated  etc. Yesterday visited the Stonelake location and you would think they could get a plate of nachos right  WRONG  First I ordered the chicken fajita nachos  sent them back as the tortillas and chicken fajitas was burnt. They had chopped the fajita meat so small it was like trying to eat jerky. The cheese was almost non existence. Sent them back and asked for JUST bean  amp  cheese nachos  with a few onions on the side. They finally arrived as most of my party was finished with their food. This time the nachos arrived with beans  a thick layer of onions  cheese and then another layer of onions. There was no way to pick off some of the onions and the cheese was like rubber. Needless to say all I got for lunch was a few chips and salsa. Come on Baby A s get a chef that can at least make a good plate of nachos.
Baby Acapulco,357,By far the most beautiful of the Baby A s. This is a good place to go for hh when you have a large group because they always have room. However  the chips are really bad. The queso is lacking and usually filmy. The deadly purple drink always does me in because I can t stand to eat their food. It is just too blah. Now  rumor has it they have improved the food here and at the one on Barton Springs  but I just haven t tried it.
Baby Acapulco,358,The purple drank was good and the bar tender was good  The food was cold and tasteless 
Baby Acapulco,359,Fantastic place if you want to have a warm-up night out restaurant. Great food  especially love the soups  chicken enchilada soup my favorite from the place  and their choriqueso dip and chips are awesome. Large margarita selection  most would tell you the purple margarita is where it s at  in which  I wouldn t disagree. However  I don t think it really isn t that superior but I do like their Superman s...great stuff their. Love coming here before going a night out of downtown.
Baby Acapulco,360,Baby Acapulco s is not what it used to be or maybe it s just this location - I hope.  I m not going to give up yet. I will try the Riverside location  because I spent a lot of time there in the late 90s between classes.  It was always great.  We ve been away from Austin for a few years now and couldn t wait to get our Baby A s fix.  I was so disappointed.  The service was embarrassingly bad.  They sat our table of five and brought one small basket of chips yet plenty of salsa to go around.  We ordered queso as an appetizer. The queso came and still no fresh chips.  By the time the chips came the queso was hardened.  The chips were cold and stale  anyway.  We kept running out of water and chips and repeatedly had to look around and ask someone for refills.  When our entr es came  we were yet again disappointed.  My enchiladas were hardened and crispy on the bottom.  I had to use a knife to cut through the enchilada   I would have sent them back but we had already waited so long for everything it just wasn t worth it.  So the service and the food quality was very poor.  I also want to mention that as we were being seated I asked the host if we could have a quieter table to the left of the hostess stand instead of a table in the middle of a very noisy section to the right of the hostess stand.  He immediately said no that section was closed.   I quietly told him that my oldest son has autism and it would really make a huge difference if we could have the quieter section which by the way did not look closed at all as there were people seated there.  He again said no the section is closed.  I gathered the family and said we ll have to leave. The host was fine with that and did not offer us any options whatsoever.  Because we had driven 30 minutes over to the restaurant from our home and it was way past dinner time for everyone  I decided to push it a little further and asked to speak with the manager.  She appeared to be annoyed  but allowed us to take the quieter table.
Baby Acapulco,361,Disappointed   We had a group of 5 meet here on Saturday night  amp  the service was soooo slow.  The place was not busy  so there s no excuse.  Over the 3 hour period that we were there  I only managed to have 3 beers.  It wasn t because I didn t want more  it was because our server kept disappearing.  We even joked with him  amp  asked if we need to order 2 drinks at a time.  I am not exaggerating when I say that on average it took us 8-10 minutes for every cocktail that we ordered.  We thought he had cut us off after our first round because we didn t see him for so long.
Baby Acapulco,362,We considered ourselves to be regulars here until two days ago  when after our  terrible dining experience I think it s safe to say that we ll never be back. I wouldn t boycott a place after one bad experience  but we ve noticed the service taking a gradual decline in the past few years.   My husband  who is the beverage manager at a local fine dining restaurant  is always interested in trying new beers and wines. He asked about a certain beer on the Baby A s menu  and the server 1  didn t really know anything about it and 2  said they didn t carry it anymore. So my husband ordered a different kind of beer  and requested the larger size but was brought the small size instead. Speaking of drinks  we asked for drink menus and were brought one to share. This isn t a big deal  but before we were done with it the server came and took it away from us to give to another table. He grabbed it in such a hurry that he grazed my husband s face with it. Our son burned his mouth on the french fries while the server happened to be walking by  and the server laughed about it  completely our fault for not checking the temperature of the food  but still.. don t laugh at him   The manager walked by and asked very apathetically about our experience. When he wasn t apathetically asking diners about their experiences he was sitting and watching TV  no doubt much more enthusiastically.  We had to ask for a to go box 3 times before getting one. The server forgot to take the kids meals off the bill on kids eat free night. Instead of apologizing  for anything  for that matter   he rather sarcastically said  Here  ya saved 10 bucks   He just needs a new job  preferably one in which he doesn t deal with people. We are easygoing people  not hard to please. And if a business makes a mistake  that s fine by us. It s how they deal with the mistake s  that matter. And by those standards  this restaurant doesn t even deserve a star.  If you re looking for a good Tex-Mex restaurant in the area that delivers on both food drinks and service  try Trudy s  Chuy s or Lupe Tortilla. We ve never had a bad experience at any of those restaurants.
Baby Acapulco,363,Thursday night happy hour is the way to go here. They have live band karaoke which is an absolute riot and the mexican martinis are delicious. I recommend the Chicken Chipotle  it s good and relatively healthy as well. The chips and salsa is good but the queso isn t my favorite. Definitely try the purple margarita if you never have  I don t get it because I prefer to maintain the ability to stand but it s definitely something you have to try at least once in your lifetime 
Baby Acapulco,364,Food was great  good price  margaritas were excellent...came after work for happy hour  both bartenders Ricky and Eddie gave great service
Baby Acapulco,365,Ok my first night in Austin and it s kind of late and i m traveling for business so I don t really know anyone here.  Check into my hotel and look up someplace close because I haven t had a chance to eat yet. Locate a place named Baby A s. Yelper s give it a so so review but it s close  it s late and i m hungry. The atmosphere  amp  music reminds me of cheesburger in paradise. Old 80 s tunes playing on the radio  amp  the crowd doesn t really look in my age range so I decide to take my stuff to go. I have to say from the sampling of Tex Mex i ve had it s never been my favorite  amp  this place really didn t change my mind. The enchlidas had some sort of chili like substance on them which was pretty decent  amp  I didn t mind it at all. The Crispy Tacos weren t too bad either  amp  all the ingredents seemed fresh. All in all I don t think it was the best place to start off my trip but it didn t let me down all that much either.  I missed out on the purple magarita s but based on the other reviews doesn t seem like I missed much.
Baby Acapulco,366,The only reason I can think of to go to Baby A s is to get smashed.  You think you are going for a casual drink and some guacamole.  Beware.  They sneak up on you.
Baby Acapulco,367,Great service  disgustingly dirty  used to be a gorgeous restaurant years ago   husband said his beef in his enchiladas was comparable to Alpo  and I felt a little dead inside because of the gas station smell on the patio.  Oh  and don t forget the unhot cougars.  We ll go back when it s not a Baby A s anymore.
Baby Acapulco,368,Loved the Blue Margarita  one was sufficient . The food was good  It was fresh and the service was decent...BUT the damn bagged chips you serve sucked the whole experience  What is up with Austin Mexican Restaurants and  serving chips from a bag  STOP  Yuck 
Baby Acapulco,369,Food s not very good - but I would recommend going on a Thursday night for their live band karaoke.  The band is great - and it s a really unique idea.  Just order drinks and snack on a few chips  though...the food isn t worth the money.
Baby Acapulco,370,Where to start....  Couldn t find the entrance  weird layout in regards to the parking lot location.  The hostess was unfriendly and made grunting noises while she walked us to our table.   Soon after we sat down  one of the table runners slammed some chips and salsa down on our table without saying a word.  Finally a man waiter walked up and took our drink order.  A few moments later a different waitress walked up and took our food order.  We watched her put the order in and clock out and leave.  Not sure who our server was at this point we waited quietly observing the restaurant.  Very dirty  severs kept the serving tray on the floor.  Does anyone make a good margarita anymore         Watched the first waiter come back with our drinks finally and the house margarita was a flop.  I noticed our waiter would wait until all of his tables drinks or food was ready before he would make the twenty yard trip from the kitchen  letting the other tables food get cold so he didn t have to make an extra trip.  Food was awful  I said at one point to my wife   I d let you try my food  but it really isn t worth the reach across the table.   We decided to order the purple margarita to hopefully have something good during our dinning experience.  The waiter kept telling us how strong they were  over and over.  All the while he failed to mention they make them with EVERCLEAR.  Seems like something you should disclose if someone says they have never had one or even been to the restaurant.   Do not go unless you are looking for bad food and a hang over from their cheap drinks 
Baby Acapulco,371,Purples  The other stuff is all just decoration for the purple margharitas.
Baby Acapulco,372,The margaritas are awesome and the waitress Jordyn S. Was beyond AMAZING    Her customer service was one of the best I have seen in Austin. If you come to this place ask for her for the best service.
Baby Acapulco,373,Yum  Really good for lunch hour. They have a lunch tortilla soup crispy taco combo that is awesome. Comes with rice so you get a lot of food for a lunch price 
Baby Acapulco,374,I went to baby A s with my best friend who works in the area on her lunch hour. We were in the mood for taco salads and soup  After 15 minutes went by  without a  hello what would you like to drink   from our server  my friend got up to tell the hostess that nobody had helped us. We noticed the guys that got sat before us already had their food and we didn t even have water  I wasn t upset about it just hungry and annoyed. After my friend got back to the table we waited yet again for a server to come to our table. We noticed two servers  both walked by us...I thought maybe they hadn t decided which one of them was gonna take our table. Nobody came up to us. By that time it was 12 30 we had to go somewhere else because my friend only had til 1 00.  Fast food   my friend and I went to the server station and said  hey nvm we are going to taco cabana   We weren t expecting a response. Then CARLOS  one of the servers who ignored us said... okay go to taco cabana bye   In a very snooty way. As we were walking out my friend stopped and turned around cause she wasn t done with the situation. I followed her and we both asked to speak to a manger cause NO SERVER SHOULD SPEAK TO A GUEST LIKE THAT. He didn t care that we were leaving out of frustration it s like he WANTED us to leave. Anyway  as we were waiting for the manager CARLOS walks by us and says something about taco cabana so my friend calls out at him.. excuse me    He comes over to us  puts his finger in our faces and says  you can go to taco cabana.  That s when I get upset. As a waitress and someone who has been working in the service industry for years  I was disappointed that a server like him exists in our industry. As servers we all get frustrated BUT NEVER should we give poor attitude towards our guests. The manager seemed a bit concerned but then told us that they were understaffed. Carlos asks my friend and I if we wanted to fill out a comment card with A LOT of attitude. We were offended and annoyed. The manager didn t do much but really  what could she do  Carlos will get away with being a complete asshole to us and taco cabana was just around the corner.
Baby Acapulco,375,I love this location. The staff is great and attentive. I have only eaten here a few times but the food was great. I really enjoy the outside veranda. there is a fireplace pit you can sit around and enjoy during the winter  they have keroke if you enjoy that  and the purple margeritas are amazing. To me it has the best atmosphere out of all the baby a s in Austin. You should definately go check it out.....
Baby Acapulco,376,The only thing keeping this place open is their margaritas.  The food sucks.  The staff is rude.  But  man...those margaritas are killer.
Baby Acapulco,377,My best came to visit Austin and we went for an early dinner   after work Monday to this one  which I personally love ...not this time. We were seated right away  yet it took our server  a young female J quite a while  to actually come to our table  after another male went to get her to take our drink order...She did not seem like she was interested in taking our orders or even a welcoming attitude. When we did get our order  she almost threw the plate at my gal pal  it made quite a loud noise and seemed like it would have turned and spilled her food  of course no apology from her almost disservice . During the meal  it seemed like she was now trying to provide better service to insure a decent tip  yet we still felt like we were being rushed out of the corner booth. This is the first time I have ever had such disrespectful service at this location  they have all been so welcoming and attentive  even when I ve been seated briefly at the bar ...I may rethink my next visit to this location again  for quite some time and definitely if I I do return and get her-we will definitely request to be re-seated.
Baby Acapulco,378,Think i lost the little fellow who tells me I ve had enough.....oh well  Tex-Mex food that is ok. If anything I like the atmosphere that this place has and the drinks keep me coming back. Be careful with the the purple Rita s because they are made with Everclear  they limit each person to 2 but one may be enough lol
Baby Acapulco,379,Jason has an energetic positive vibe that always brings us back. And treats us as a friend.
Baby Acapulco,380,I have had bad experiences every time I visit this location.  It s in a great area which is convenient to get to  so I have given it a few extra chances  but it s terrible every time.  Last night we had a server who was apparently working his first day.  He was friendly enough  however he clearly had no clue how to wait tables.  Our empty plates sat in front of us for at least 15 minutes.  After we piled them all up in the middle of the table  a manager eventually came by to pick them up.  I realize that each server has to learn the job  but a new employee should be paired up with another more experienced server for training.  We ordered wings which were tiny and VERY overpriced.  The order of 16 wings probably had a total of 2 ounces of meat.   Our water cups were never refilled.
Baby Acapulco,381,A hip  happening  casual place.  Always popular with me and my friends.  They have locations all over town.  This particular location has a big area set up for live music.  You cant beat the happy hour specials half-off appetizers here   It s a big place too  so there is plenty of room tables  and there is plenty to choose from off the menu.  Also great for graduation engagement parties.  I love their shrimp nachos.  Beware the purple ritas 
Baby Acapulco,382,This has to be my favorite location. And my number 1 spot for Happy Hour. Their Margaritas and Queso are the best   They have karoke on Thursdays which is cool and outside they have an awesome firepit for when it actually get chilly. And I go there so often I ve got a favorite waitress  if you go ask for Jordyn she is awesome 
Baby Acapulco,383,Came in for a quick meal and ended up staying for 2 hours talking to eddie  the bartender . The food he recommended was amazing and the margaritas were awesome  ill be back for the live music on the weekends
Baby Acapulco,384,We went to Baby A s for a birthday engagement party Saturday.   We had maybe 30 there.  The service by Juanita was just awful.  She was friendly enough but you didn t have coke products  didn t have Mountain Dew  not even Root Beer.  When I asked what you did have she just said Dr Pepper  amp  Pepsi  amp  Lemonade.  It took forever to order.  We never got napkins or silverware and I never got a drink refill  not that I had a chance to ask  and we were there 3 hours .   Everyone who ordered after us got their food before us and we asked and she assumed we got ours and knew what we ordered but no.  So after another tremendously long wait we got our little wings.   When we complained at the end she said people were in our area that were not part of our party  which was not the case.  There should have been more than one server but judging by the yelp complaints  you re always understaffed.  On the good side it s a really nice restaurant  with nice d cor and nice indoor outdoor seating and we liked the band that played.  I just can t believe service can be so bad at a restaurant that should be wanting to make 30 people happy.  Two stars may be generous but we had a good time at the party at least.
Baby Acapulco,385,Had a great night with friends. Tyler was great and made sure we had food and drinks 
Baby Acapulco,386,Walked in here after shopping. Food was okay nothing spectacular. I got the baby A s soup  aka Tortilla soup . I also got a strawberry lime margarita. I wasn t impressed with the margarita but it was drinkable. I know there are better Mexican restaurants in Austin 
Baby Acapulco,387,While is Austin  Texas  visiting my two youngest sons we wanted to check out Baby A s Restaurant. It is within walking distance to where my sons live.  We were greeted inside the entryway by Darah J.  I asked her if they had any booths  in which she responded   No.   I realized she was teasing and  immediately  I liked her sense of humor.  Darah seated us in a comfortable booth and asked if we would like something to drink.  She brought us a huge basket of warm chips and salsa and  then  told us about the Happy Hour Specials. The restaurant was cheerfully decorated with Christmas lights  which made for a cozy atmosphere.  Darah was extremely polite and said how much she loved working at this restaurant.  We ordered some Happy Hour Drinks and appetizers  which were amazing.  I ordered the Taco Salad and it was really delicious.  We sat and visited for a couple of hours.  Almost  every employee who walk past us asked if there was anything we needed.  Of course  we requested more chips and salsa   My sons purchased Martinis which were really good.  We hope to go back  again  before my vacation ends this weekend.  Darah J. was just so very friendly  knowledgeable  and accommodating.  It is  always  a pleasure to find a server who truly loves their job.  I rate Baby A s Five Stars and recommend it to any one who visits Austin  Texas. Thank you so much.
Baby Acapulco,388,Normally our family would dine at the Howard Lane  location and have never had an issue.  But we decided to try Stonelake. WORST mistake ever. The service was bad and the waitress Maddie was very rude.  Are you all done because my shift is over . Her behavior was discussed with the manager and it was clearly known at that point her behavior was learned and we d found the source. As we paid our bill and left a tip  another waitress approached and I quote   Do you all have children  sarcastically   . Really     NEVER  NEVER did I saw NEVER will I patronize this establishment again. I m only giving the rating of 1 star because yelp won t let me post without selecting one.
Baby Acapulco,389,I was surprised everything was really good. I don t know why everyone is giving sub par reviews. I am a fairly picky eater as for taste. I have been to countless fine dining places  and for an inexpensive place the food was really good. I am planning on returning.
Baby Acapulco,390,We go to this place like once a week. The margaritas are a MUST have. They definitely hit the spot on a Friday night after a long work week. The regular table salsa is pretty spicy which is nice. I usually get the fajitas and the steak is so tender its great. Their sliders are fantastic too. I look forward to going to this place.
Baby Acapulco,391,Come for the drinks and decent food. The tortilla soup really is pretty good  otherwise most other items on the menu will satisfy you. Service can be hit or miss. The only complaint I have is from a visit in the past when the waiter argued with the table next to us about what kind of beans they ordered  seriously. I guess they got charged for the extra beans and wanted to know why  the waiter refused to correct the mistake. I have a feeling he lost his tip over that  1.99 for the bean mistake. Other than that  give it a try.
Baby Acapulco,392,I m so sad to write this review as I ve been going to Baby A s for happy hours lunches  dinners for years now.  I m a frequent customer of theirs and have seen a sudden shift of management and staff.  Today at lunch  I was shocked to see there was only 2 cooks and a few servers to manage the whole restaurant.  We were hoping to have a quick lunch.  It took about 10 minutes for our server to come around.  He was out of breath and I felt totally sorry for him having to wait on all the tables around us.  Our food took a lot longer than usual and came out incorrect.  I wasn t about to say anything because it would take another 20 minutes to get it corrected.  I don t blame our waiter at all.  The manager came around to see how everything was.  We asked him for something that was never brought to us.  As many times as I ve been here  I ve never seen this manager before.  He clearly is nothing like the former manager that ran a tight ship there.  I m afraid this will not be my go-to place for much longer if my experiences continue to be like this.  I ve seen the service continue to go downhill week after week  yes  I go there a lot .
Baby Acapulco,393,Girlfriend and I did a movie at Gateway 16 last night  starving when we left  theater really needs to increase their service staff on weekend nights... LOOONG wait  and several of us said to heck with it  and dropped out of line.  We re missing the movie     Anyway  Baby A s is what it is... good Tex-Mex  a fun atmosphere  and our server  Linda  was very attentive and good at taking care of us   Hope Baby A s owners appreciate her - she ll draw business in  We tend to be a bit spontaneous - seems like the least expected experiences are the funnest  so we like to just make those last minute decisions to try something.  It Was fun to discover a cover band playing the inside outside covered area.  Band is named  Spark    Like so many places in Austin  live cover bands are everywhere and this one was better than most.  Apparently  they ve just grouped together and I have to say they were tight and enjoyable.  If you get a chance to catch them  you ll enjoy them   The harmony s of the ladies and gents in the band were spot on  and well coordinated - and the lead guitarist is good when he bears down on it and solo s. Love walking in to an Austin spot  never knowing what to expect  and be entertained so well 
Baby Acapulco,394,Slow service  overpriced happy hour  mediocre  at best  tacos. The purple margaritas are the only thing worth getting  but are still nothing special compared to the wealth of great watering holes Austin has to offer.
Baby Acapulco,395,Sat for 15 minutes with a basket of chips. No water. Waiters walking past us with no concern. Restaurant was not 1 3 full.
Baby Acapulco,396,So it was late on a Wednesday night and the boy and I wanted some food.  We thought we d give this Baby A s a try  mainly because we couldn t remember why we avoided it in the first place. Oh ya  now we remember.  The margaritas are blah. His frozen didn t taste like anything and my tasted syrupy-sweet.  Our waitress took forever to do everything and she couldn t remember what was on each plate  which I get  I work on a restaurant and sometimes things just slip your mind. But I didn t even get beans on my plate and when I asked if there were supposed to be black beans with my tacos she said  what kind did they give you . And there were obviously not any on my plate.  Then I was half way done with my meal before I even got those beans.   It took forever to get our food.  And it was not busy at all. Like barely steady.  Our food was pretty bland as well. Nothing to remember.  I didn t even take the rest of mine home which is rare for me.  Overall  the service didn t care  the food was nothing memorable and I won t be back.
Baby Acapulco,397,This place is awesome I love the staff  and they have very good manager s   Adrian is the greatest. They really need to add some different items to the menu We need some new food choices  other than that I just love this place  it s one of my favorites. The drinks are great and don t forget to try the purple very good     SEE YA THERE     Evelyn  amp  John
Baby Acapulco,398,Luuuuv this place. I may get a side-eye for saying this  but I choose Baby A s over Trudy s any day  Purple  amp  Superman Margaritas are the best. Great staff  great vibe  great food  love it  
Baby Acapulco,399,Go there Sunday at 1 PM  party of 7.  Everything s good as usual but when the food is served it takes an extra 30 minutes to get the orders of two of the diners finally served.  The manager does come over and apologize but doesn t offer to comp the meals and of course they automatically take their gratuity anyway.  I consider myself a very generous tipper but that amount is based on the service of the restaurant and  or the waiter.  In this case it would have been significantly lower due to poor service.  I didn t have that option since they deducted it due to the amount of people in the party.  I guess money is more important then customer satisfaction to this Baby A s.  I won t be going back to this one
Baby Acapulco,400,I have loved Baby A s for the last 20 years I have lived here  but I was more than disappointed by my experience today.  I got there on Cinco De Mayo thinking it would be crowded  it wasn t.  We found a table and was provided chips very fast  but no waiter was in sight  again it was not crowded.  After 5 minutes Checko shows up gets us drink and then disappears  about another 5 minutes we ask for water and was told water is not provided cause of the drought  and put his hand on my shoulder  ok but that should have been told to us when we sat.  Took another 5 minutes to get water  at least.  The rest of the party showed up  3 adults  1 child  and we told them to order a drink ASAP when the waiter decides to show up.  He seemed to not want to be there and his attitude showed.  As stated I have been to Baby A s and the service was always fun  the food was never great  but the rita s are ok.  We finally ordered  2 burgers  nachos  and queso.  The burgers  and nachos came out but not the queso  it is just melted cheese  right    Took almost another 7 minutes till the queso came out.   A bit later a manager  female  red-dyed hair  came out to see how we were doing  she didn t go to any other table.  We said the service was lacking big time  the waiter was very apathetic  she said what could she do  and offered deserts  we were still eating our food  and we declined the deserts.  We just stated that the waiter should be spoken to.  she stood there and spoke to us for almost 10 minutes and we said we were fine  but she continued to talk to us.  About 5 minutes later she came back and offered us lip balm from a tequilla company  and we declined.  Part of our party was there two night before and had a great experience with another waitress and the manager then had her come by and check on our table and she was bubbly and enthusiastic  the way I am used to.  We finished our meal and the check came and there was gratuity added automatically  since there were 6 of us  even though the child did not eat.    Bottom line  food was ok  drinks ok  service was horrible  management involvment uneeded  and nothing was reflected on our bill.   Bahama breeze was great and always crowded  I can see why Baby A s at this location was empty on Cinco De Mayo.  Not planning to come back here ever again.
Baby Acapulco,401,This franchise has the potential to be a fairly decent place to go. However  b c the insist on nepotism in having the owner s unqualified daughter overseeing many aspects  coupled with mediocre quality at all levels  it remains a middle of the pack choice in ATX. Perhaps tightening up a dedication to quality and hiring actual pros in the industry to run and manage would elevate you to a respectable level. Margs are still powerful and good if you are willing to settle on every other aspect of your experience to get them.
Baby Acapulco,402,The food is not good.   The service was not the worst  except the waiter  Dan  put on a pregratuitity  something he can only do if we were an 8 person party    but there was only 2 of us.   The assumption that we were no tipping scum was insulting.  Then when the credit card slip came back asking for even more gratuity I realized they were trying to take advantage of us   amp  hope we didn t notice that they had pregratted us  so we would unknowingly double tip.  I called management to make them aware that at least 1 of the wait staff was opportunistic   amp  conniving.  He was rude  amp  unconcerned.  That s when I decided to  yelp.
Baby Acapulco,403,Horrible service. I called in to place a to go order and kept getting placed on hold for a ridiculously long time. As I passed it on my way home I decided to just pick it up. When I got there I was told they don t do to go orders. That is fine if that is their policy  but we have picked stuff up before. And why didn t they say that on the phone. And why did they have to be so rude about it. We have had bad service and messed up orders while dining it  so this was the last straw. I will not be going back.
Baby Acapulco,404,The cheese enchiladas tasted like a TV dinner. The baby changa was a gelatinous blob of soggy goo. The salsa had the spice of 1000 jalape os. The queso tasted worse than velveeta. Every liquid based food item had a skin on it when it was brought to the table. Totally worth the experience if your wanting to write a good negative review 
Baby Acapulco,405,Don t. Do. It. Do not go here. Horrible food  horrible drinks  horrible service. Good live band is the only thing going for it.
Baby Acapulco,406,I have eaten takeout at a different Baby A s before and thought it was mediocre but was willing to give it another shot. There was a large group of us that went  30-40  and  I was told  someone had called in over a week ahead to reserve the room and let them know a large group would be there. When we showed up they were unprepared for a group of this size. The manager that day was running around taking orders and apologizing that they were understaffed. He seemed overwhelmed but also seemed to be doing most of the work required to take care of a group that large. The food was once again mediocre. Nothing to complain about but it didn t really stick out in my mind either. There was a live jazz band playing in another room and on Sunday s for brunch they have  1 mimosas. I would be willing to go back to listen to some jazz and drink mimosas but am likely to go elsewhere any time I feel the need to eat Mexican Tex-Mex food.
Baby Acapulco,407,This was the worst service I have had a restaurant in over 5 years  we eat out at least 3-4 times a week. This waitress was slow and didn t care. The food tasted like it was zapped in a microwave.
Baby Acapulco,408,I love this place.  I never have to wait long.  Staff is always pleasant and food is good.  I m a huge fan of the purple margaritas   If you re looking for a chill spot for a laid back dinner or drinks  then this is a good palce.
Baby Acapulco,409,I ve eaten at Baby Acapulco s a couple times at two different locations.  My last visit was this past weekend at the Stonelake Boulvard location.  The place seems to be just as much as a drinking establishment as a restaurant.  We were there on Saturday night and quite a few people were trashed  as in more than drunk .   I had the Seafood Enchiladas and my wife had the Grilled Salmon Salad.  We also had their famous Purple Margaritas.  The service was excellent and our waiter was very attentive and helpful.  The food was good  but nothing special.  Baby Acapulco s seems to really excel in their drinks and my favorite thing about my meal  on both visits  was the Purple Margarita.  These Margaritas have Everclear in them so be careful.  There is suppose to be a 2 drink per person limit on them   but our server said he would serve as many as we wanted as long as we had a DD  which we did .  Oh yeah  we also saw a guy projectile vomit on his way to the bathroom and then had the unpleasant experience of watching our fellow unsuspecting diners walk through the vomit for the next few minutes.  This wasn t the restaurant s fault...but it s going to happen when you serve drinks with Everclear in them.
Baby Acapulco,410,First time ever  Appreciative of the late-night hours.  Excited to enjoy an adult beverage until we learned that ALL their drinks are tequila-based margaritas.  Not being a fan of tequila  we were pretty limited  but asked the waitress for suggestions.  She had none  so we went for Corona and Limes...always a good choice at a Tex-Mex joint.  I had the Helen s Combo....tortilla soup  green chicken enchilada and choice of crispy or puffy taco.  I think a puffy taco means it comes in a little corn tortilla bowl   The green sauce on my enchilada was fresh  unique  amp  delish  The taco was average and ordinary  but still fresh and fine.  The tortilla soup was warm  full of chicken and very tasty.  Not spicy at all  but very satisfying.  My fave tortilla soup is from Chuy s however.  My friend had the Jerry s burrito being a cheese-covered-anything fan  he was thrilled.  Filled with meat  beans and rice  then covered in melted queso....too big to eat all at once  but he left stuffed like a pig and happy  The only downside was the lackluster service.  After looking directly in the server s eyes and asking for extra limes  we finally went to the bar and retrieved our own.  Some people  We ll be back  I was impressed by the freshness and the selections here.  Also  the chips were warm and the salsa was different than any I ve tried in a while.  Not bad  not bad  Nick 
Baby Acapulco,411,One entire star for live music only. Especially the jazz Pharos on Sunday. Food   suck. They advertise maple syrup pancakes. Not maple syrup. Not honest.
Baby Acapulco,412,Worst dining experience I ve had in a long time.  It took forever to get our drinks. We had to eat 3 4 of our queso cold because we waited forever to have our chip basket refilled. I finally had to get up and ask someone for chips. The server barely came by. The food is awful. American cheese   Really   For cheese enchiladas   Taco Bell has better cheese. The band was awful  9 3  and way to loud. I will never go back 
Baby Acapulco,413,awful   everything from service to food.  will never go back even if i was offered  free food and drinks.
Taqueria La Libertad,1,One of my favorite taco trucks in Austin  It doesn t look like much from the front  but everything I ve tried has been amazing. My favorite is the Al Pastor tacos. It s really easy to call ahead and pick up your order to-go if you re in a rush 
Taqueria La Libertad,2,It s hard to go wrong on Riverside when you re looking for street tacos in the middle of the night. It s hard cause it s right next to Anita s but we decided to give is a shot and I m so glad we did. This taco brought me back to life that night  I only wish I ate more.
Taqueria La Libertad,3,Are they the best tacos I ve ever had or even the cheapest  Nope but they re still GOOD. They got you covered on your three main meats  barbacoa  carnitas  al pastor  and while they ran a bit too much on the fatty side they still hit the spot. I will say their salsas were a little disappointing though  a tad watery with not too much flavor. I will say the corn tortillas are some of the best I ve had in a minute though. The horchata is the perfect accompaniment  not to mention MASSIVE   so all in all  not too bad of a spot to swing by if you re in the area.
Taqueria La Libertad,4,Super tacos for a great price  Food truck out side of a tire shop but had two picnic tables to eat at.
Taqueria La Libertad,5,WOW. These tacos were delicious and inexpensive--odd location in the parking lot of an auto shop  but 5 5 recommend. Careful of the red salsa--it is SPICY 
Taqueria La Libertad,6,Exceptional horchata  enormous cups too   taco suadero was great  al pastor and carnitas just good. The white green salsa was much better and I would want to ask for more of those rather than the red next time.
Taqueria La Libertad,7,The inner Mexican child in me smiled from ear to ear. These tacos are not only bomb but AUTHENTIC. I Love how this stand is chillin on the side of the road ready to serve amazing food only by a whim would someone take the chance to try it this is why I am writing a review. The price to flavor ratio is through the roof. The burritos are at a great size can t wait to come back for more.
Taqueria La Libertad,8,Exactly what you expect from a Taco Truck. Good breakfast tacos  amazing Barbacoa and Bistek tacos. If you re looking for a quick bite  make a stop here for sure.
Taqueria La Libertad,9,I love this place    This is my hidden gem in Austin. Great tacos with handmade corn and flour tortillas. Price is right at  2 taco so load up    If you are looking for tasty tacos that don t cost an arm and a leg you found the spot. That being said  you aren t going to find some crazy Tex mex combos here  just amazing prepared meat  onions and cilantro. Yum    Owners are super friendly and don t worry if you don t speak Spanish  they will understand you just fine.   I ve come 3 times in the last 2 weeks since I found this place. They are seriously that good 
Taqueria La Libertad,10,Probably get this place at least once a week  always fast but made to order  Great melon and pineapple water and some of the best corn tortillas in town 
Taqueria La Libertad,11,I was craving several of the menu items since I saw the photos. Woke up hungry so went for a couple of breakfast burritos. I m giving the place 3 stars because    Positive  1  Burritos were tasty. I got egg  potato bacon  cheese  amp  the husband got egg  bean  amp  cheese. 2  They were quite large  You re getting the equivalent of at least 3 breakfast tacos with these.  Not the greatest  1  I started calling when they opened  according to online hours   amp  they didn t pick up for 1 2 an hour. 2  They really were like breakfast tacos  prep  amp  flavor-wise. As much as I like breakfast tacos  the whole reason I went here was because the pictures showed the tortillas all toasted  amp  grilled. Nope. Soft tortillas. Good  but just like tacos with a larger tortilla  amp  folded ends. 3  No masks. Well  the gal who took my card put on a mask  after  she opened the window  amp  was reminded to  but the two others in the truck cooking were maskless.  4   Not their fault  but...  3 others waiting for food just outside were maskless as well. If you re being religious about masks  amp  social distancing  might want to wait this one out.
Taqueria La Libertad,12,Excellent hidden gem on the east side  Not ideal to eat here since it s attached to auto shop but they have seating and a tent for shade. Awesome service and quick turnaround. All day breakfast tacos under  3  great spot for lunch tacos - I recommend the carnitas taco and both the melon and pineapple agua fresca  
Taqueria La Libertad,13,Super delicious and authentic Mexican tacos. Their shrimp tacos are the best in Austin. Shrimp tacos with one of their agua frescas is the perfect meal on a hot day after a workout or being in the sun.
Taqueria La Libertad,14,Excellent food all around. Great mom and pop authentic mexican taco stand. I highly recommend the bistec burrito as well as the chorizo quesadilla  the shrimp taco  and the carnitas taco.   Charming atmosphere too and great service. We will be returning frequently.
Taqueria La Libertad,15,Great service and fantastic food  Looking forward to my next visit and so should you  Just awesome.
Taqueria La Libertad,16,BEST Mexican food truck  in Austin period     Best breakfast burritos  gorditas  sopes  breakfast tacos  
Taqueria La Libertad,17,For a hole in the wall place  it s really amazing  The tacos are good size  and the corn tortillas are fresh and great quality 
Taqueria La Libertad,18,Best tripas tacos in Austin  So crispy  Love their breakfast tacos as well   My parents go every weekend bc it s our go to   They updated their menu and it looks amazing   
Taqueria La Libertad,19,A hole in the wall inside the tire station parking lot on Airport Blvd. Taqueria La Libertad offers some great tacos. It was that good that we had to stop by again in the morning for their awesome breakfast tacos. The green sauce has some nice kick to it 
Taqueria La Libertad,20,Food is amazing  Authentic Mexican  quick and simple  Great lunch specials 
Taqueria La Libertad,21,Taco truck in the parking lot of the Macedo tire shop on Airport.  Spring 2018 - moved to tire shop lot at corner of Airport and Springdale   Breakfast tacos all day - only  1.75 each  The basic potato bacon egg taco is solidly good.   The burrito al pastor   6.00  is also good stuff.
Taqueria La Libertad,22,Seriously lame tacos. Nothing special  no flavor. Took forever and they were out of all agua frescas.
Taqueria La Libertad,23,Best taco truck in Austin  Got the torta and burrito  both very good. The green salsa is super spicy but delicious 
Taqueria La Libertad,24,Have had Campechanos  al pastor  steak and chicken. All are great and cooked fresh. Their Green Salsa is the best 
Taqueria La Libertad,25,I ll say it again Best Taco Truck in town 
Taqueria La Libertad,26,I love this taco truck. The food is delicious  I ve only ever had breakfast tacos there which they serve all day . The prices are very low and the people inside are nice. Note  they moved across the street to the corner of Airport and Springdale.
Taqueria La Libertad,27,Cheap and good. Get the breakfast tacos. Have Mexican soft drinks if you re interested. The Tortas and Cubanos are huge. Burrito are decent sized  not big though. Worth a visit on a slow Saturday or Sunday morning lunch.
Taqueria La Libertad,28,Luckiest bus transfer ever  where a twenty minute wait gave us plenty of time to hit La Libertad for tacos bistec  barbacoa  and breakfast style egg and bean. All terrific and made 100  to order. Salsas were hittin too  that rojo one was HOT. Looking forward to a return trip sooooon.
Taqueria La Libertad,29,Amazing tacos for an awesome price.  Their chorizo egg  amp  cheese and bacon egg  amp  cheese tacos are awesome.   Fried eggs...not scrambled.    I also like their al pastor but surprisingly their chicken tacos are great too.  The flour tortillas are fresh and fluffy.   Sooo inexpensive too.   La Libertad could almost double their prices and I d still pay.
Taqueria La Libertad,30,My favorite tacos de tripas and fajitas  Just tried it and every time I get the chance to come eat I will  Their green salsa is the best one. I have tried their gorditas which I like I wish they had avocado but it s what you prefer. I would recommend their fajita tacos  
Taqueria La Libertad,31,I ll probably increase to a 5 after giving this little gem a few more visits.  The corn tortilla was a bit dry without enough inside to cut the dryness.  However  the fillings of the chicken taco were great  and the price is hard to beat.  I ll certainly go back.  On the value scale  this is definitely a 5.
Taqueria La Libertad,32,Ordered two pastor tacos on corn tortillas with cilantro and onion for  4. They came out very hot and with a sliced lime perfectly wrapped in aluminum foil and two mini containers of taco sauce. Delicious lunch served by a very sweet woman. I ll be back the next time I m in the neighborhood 
Taqueria La Libertad,33,This place is the absolute best taco spot in Austin. Their Barbacoa melts in your mouth  their quesadillas are rich and the prices  while rising a little  are still hard to beat.
Taqueria La Libertad,34,The pastor tacos and sopes are delicious   The people that run the truck are really nice and get the food out quickly.
ZIKI,1,This is one of my new favorite late night go-tos. That doesn t mean it s only good for a late night snack  it s also good for regular meals  but I like that it s on DoorDash and open late.  Both the burritos and quesadillas are great  you can choose what sauce Greek sauce you want with them  and they have falafel and ziki bites  crispy spanakopita bites  as vegetarian options. The fusion of Greek and Mexican works really well. Burritos and quesadillas are some of the best ways to eat food  but if you like the freshness of Greek food  this is the perfect spot for you 
ZIKI,2,This place is a super yummy Greek   Mexican fusion food truck on South Congress   Everything I tried was DELISHHH and it truly made my taste buds dance   What to order  Gyro Grain Bowl Falafel Bites ZIKI Bites  crispy feta   spinach balls   Fries  A HUGE portion of Ziki s menu is Gluten-free and they avoid soy  peanut oil  palm oil  artificials  waste so you can truly feel good about what you eat  Can t wait to go back
ZIKI,3,This is a newly discovered food truck for me.  I have been here about 3 times. I love the falafel bowl with a side of ziki bites   It all is so flavorful  the combination of what it has in it  is perfect  I was just there today and I ordered my food incorrectly but the team there corrected my order for me  complimentary  I will be a regular and so should you 
ZIKI,4,Ok  I have no idea where I been and why am I just now finding out about this place  Seriously one of my new FAVORITE spots  The food was AMAZING the location is pretty cool there s so many other food trucks in the same spot  The amount of food they serve you is well worth what you pay  I ended up getting the basil fajita chicken bowl and husband got the pork zurrito  And I also got the Iced berry green tea  Omg everything was soo good  all I can say is  JUST GO and get you some ZIKI  It s so worth it  I can t wait to go back   
ZIKI,5,This place is great.  There are a lot of gluten free options here. Had the Ziki Bites.  It was gluten free and delicious   Also  had the Chicken Zurrito and that was really good too. Very good cuts of white meat grilled chicken  fresh ingredients and yummy tzatziki sauce.  Tip   Pre order on the app  as there are a lot of online orders and you will have to wait a bit if you order when you get there.  It is a food truck with two guys making the food  so when there are a lot of orders it may take a bit.  We had to wait about 20 minutes  as we did not pre order  but it was well worth the wait.  A must stop in my opinion for delicious food  great gluten free options and very reasonably priced...
ZIKI,6,First off.. ZIKI never misses  Delicious and they use healthy fresh ingredients. My first time there I got the slow cooked pork quesadilla and some greek feta fries. Cured my hangover  and I didn t feel like a slob after eating it. The berry yogurt and baklava desserts are out of this world. The first time I got the yogurt  was trying to be healthy  and it hit the spot  especially the fresh berries on top.   My 2nd visit to ZIKI was late like 10 30 at night and I drove over to the truck on congress  and my order was ready within 6 min of me ordering  I got the Basil Fajita Chicken grain bowl and a baklava. Both were hella bomb and super filling. I had left overs from  both and reheated it the next day and I swear it was even better    Im also super obsessed with the ZIKI avocado jalape o sauce. It s not spicy  so creamy and addicting   10 10 for ZIKKI  My new go to spot for affordable  healthy  yummy eats 
ZIKI,7,Thank you   zikikitchens for allowing me to collaborate with y all    Definitely Five stars   Delicious meals   tasty treats   great vibes     Highly recommend this place    
ZIKI,8,New fav food truck alert  I experienced love at first bite. My fav bites were the Ziki bites  zurrito  pork bowl and Greek fries. Be sure to get the berry Ziki tea too  It s so refreshing   I give this food truck a 10 10  and the atmosphere is vibrant and super fun.
ZIKI,9,I work super close and walked over one day. Ordered a gyro bowl and a frappe. I don t eat a lot at lunch so I was literally able to save it at work and eat it 3 days in a row for lunch  It was so much food and It was still good by day 3 lol. The frappe was too icy so I wouldn t get that again  but I ll be back to try something new soon
ZIKI,10,I ve seen the social media hype for this place and while it gets points for creativity and for being VGF friendly  it was underwhelming in my experience.   The falafels and spanakopita by itself were good  but the bowls were a pass. The ingredients were not fresh  the combinations made little sense  and with so little sauce dressing  flavors were lacking.
ZIKI,11,Good spot. I love that they are open late. I tried the burrito I think the first time and second time I ordered the Greek salad and ziki bites. I love that they have me a big sauce for the bites and an extra sauce for the Greek salad. The Greek salad is very yummy.
ZIKI,12,LOVE the color. Not that that s the most important thing  but still. Super cute little area near some trailer shops. You order from a screen and then they hand it to you. I had the bowl with gyro meat and added extra cucumber salsa-- be aware if you re like me that the salsa is pretty much cucumber   onion  I hate onion so picked it out . Lunch was delicious  only taking off a star because it was kind of pricey--  16 and change for a gyro bowl. I did appreciate that they never pressured me to tip  so at least it was only that.   Would definitely go again.
ZIKI,13,So good  Really incredible food and they give you a lot of it   Seriously good portions at good prices.  The ziki bites are a must  Can t wait to go back 
ZIKI,14,The bast of the best Ziki my lovely place keep going chicken amazing the falafel and ice tea just wow
ZIKI,15,Ziki kitchens now has a food truck on South Congress   In true Ziki fashion  the bigger than your average food truck sports a beautiful bright pink color and serves up their phenomenal Greek cuisine with a hint of Mexican influences.

ZIKI,17,ZIKI is Austin s newest and most unique food truck I ve been to in a while.

They re good-sized portions and the prices are great considering the high quality ingredients they use  Plus  the food is filling and each dish packs a punch of flavor and I don t have much criticism on what I ate. So whether you re craving tacos  a burrito  or a bowl - you won t go wrong either way.  All in all  I left highly highly satisfied and give them a strong 4.75 5 for being absolutely amazing  I will DEFINITELY be back soon 
ZIKI,18,My favorite Greek-Mexican food EVER. Tastes perfect  Hope to have ZIKI around forevermore   
ZIKI,19,I had an amazing experience at Ziki Kitchens  I tried their location on South Congress  and what I ordered was absolutely delicious   This food truck serves Mexican-Greek fusion food  and I thought that would be super cool to try. It definitely did not disappoint. They use locally sourced ingredients as well  I ordered the Chicken Zurrito. This is made with a Flour Tortilla  Basil Fajita Chicken  Yellow Rice  Chipotle ZIKI  Garlic Sauce  Pico de Gallo  Crumbled Feta  Grilled Corn  and Cilantro Cabbage Slaw. I ll be coming back here to try some of their other menu items for sure 
ZIKI,20,Great people and great food. There s a unique energy and they re ever improving it seems.
ZIKI,21,Fantastic Mediterranean bowls the best on Congress. Come here     I got the basil fajita chicken bowl
ZIKI,22,Stumbled upon this place on Door Dash  and I m so glad I did. I got the pork bowl and it did not disappoint. Pork was sweet and just enough spicy  Everything tasted really fresh too.
ZIKI,23,I don t usually write reviews but since there are minimal for this food truck I thought I d share my positive experience   I just ordered the chicken bowl around 12 30 am this morning  late night and not much variety out there . I like to think of myself as a Greek food expert  trying many places in Austin  and this place does not disappoint.   First  every piece of the bowl was well seasoned  fresh  and not thrown together poorly  even after delivery and it being so late at night . There are also generous portions  I have enough for at least two meals. Chicken was juicy and well spiced  chick peas were crunchy and delightful  and rice was cooked well  The ziki and garlic sauce were delicious as well. The bowl was put together thoughtfully  impressive for receiving the ordered via DoorDash and it being so late  I will definitely be ordering from here again 
ZIKI,24,Ordered once and I m hooked  The food was so flavorful and fresh  and the portions are generous. I got the falafel bowl  and my husband got the Greek salad. It was delish. Can t wait to get it again 
ZIKI,25,Fresh food with quality ingredients  Finding restaurants in Austin that don t use seed oils is next to impossible  many self proclaimed  health conscious  spots are the worst culprits . Fries cooked in beef tallow instead of vegetable canola peanut oil is an actual DREAM. Literally the only place in Austin you can find that. Everything we ordered was amazing  fresh  and ready on-time. Cannot recommend this place enough - I wish I found it sooner 
ZIKI,26,Excellent food  service  location  hours of operation  and hospitality. I ve never seen Mexican infused with Greek. We tried the falafel wrap  a burrito-like meal  and it s vegetarian.   The original tzatziki sauce it a gray pairing. The desserts are good too   clean outdoor dining.  Very friendly staff.  And you can watch them prepare your food through the large windows. I always love the transparency of how dishes are prepared and the cleanliness of the kitchen. Thank you  Will be back with friends.
ZIKI,27,Wow that Chicken Zurrito was amazing    It had really great flavor. I will definitely be back soon 
ZIKI,28,So glad we came across this gem  This is seriously amazing Mediterranean food. They opened very recently  but I selfishly want everyone to come try Ziki out  and fall in love with it  just so I can have it forever. Bowls were perfectly balanced  sauces were so tasty  veggies were fresh  meat rice wasn t greasy  like Mediterranean usually is  - all the flavors blended so well together. Also falafel is a must try 
ZIKI,29,Been there 3 times. First time was delicious but the ticket time for a food truck was long  15 minutes . Went back 2 more times and the ticket time was 40 minutes for a food truck   Insane as it is located in the lawn which is blister hot. Also the food quality the last 2 times were terrible. All rice no sauce or meat. Do not recommend. Consistency   food quality is not there 
ZIKI,30,I ordered the Chicken Zurrito on DoorDash because it was late and there weren t many options. I decided to try Ziki because I love a good local restaurant and they were still delivering.   This is probably one of my best decisions.   First of all  the price is extremely fair. This burrito is HUGE. You could easily have leftovers and enjoy this thing twice. I also got the fries which are seasoned quite well and it s a huge portion. I think I ended up paying  20 which included all the delivery fees. Obviously DoorDash is third party but it s still such a steal. You re definitely getting your money s worth here and it s SO GOOD   Please come here. They do Mediterranean style food extremely well. I m very pleased 
ZIKI,31,Delicious  Try the falafel tacos..yum. Healthy and filling. Touch screen ordering outlet is pretty neat.
ZIKI,32,Late night arrival to town and wanted something resembling healthy so I found this place. We bought the falafel burrito and gyro burrito and it was absolutely delicious. I was so happy to have found this place. Definitely recommend you check it out. One note they only accept credit cards no cash.
ZIKI,33,Best falafel I ve ever had  super crispy  Greek salad was ok  more of a cucumber and onion salad 
ZIKI,34,Ziki is excellent  I highly recommend it to anyone who is thinking of eating there. It is truly one of my favorite spots in Austin
ZIKI,35,Ordered this on Uber eats and it s missing half of the items-no pita bread  wrong dressings  will not visit this place again. Would have been nice to be able to eat the  8 hummus I ordered - no bread included.
